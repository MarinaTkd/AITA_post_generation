0,AITA for not inviting my friends girlfriend to my Halloween party because I don’t like her?,"Fake names 

I (25 F) have been friends with Rob(25 M) since college. We both didn’t really have friends since the college we attended was out of our home states and we often studied together which led to us becoming close friends. Obviously, we are still close but just not as much. We still talk on the phone and hangout occasionally. 

Rob started seeing “Ariana” (22 F) during our last year of college. They have been officially dating for two years. As the title shows, we don’t really like each other. Our personalities could not be more opposite. She was/is always into being girly, chatty, and just a lot. It’s just not what I prefer. Also it got worse when me and Ariana got into an argument a year ago during my Halloween party that led us to REALLY disliking each other. I host the Halloween party every year, the Saturday before Halloween. Because of everything I stated, I didn’t invite her again. When Rob called Friday night to asked what “they” should bring I told him I just invited him and not Ariana. He apologized for making an assumption but then told me to count one off the list because he won’t be attending. This upset me because he has never missed my Halloween party before. I asked if she really couldn’t be alone for one night. He said it wasn’t about her it was just his decision to not go somewhere that excluded his girlfriend. The call got awkward and we hung up shortly after. The party on Saturday was great but I did miss my friend being there. I’ve felt guilty all weekend like I made a bad move.

1,WIBTA if I confronted my dad about his cheating?,"Context: My (23m) parents have been divorced for a decade, and my dad remarried a couple years later. At the time, I voiced my disapproval of his new relationship, which led to him saying a lot of hurtful things. At their wedding (eight years ago at the time of writing), I discovered he had cheated on my mom with his now wife. I never confronted him about it because I'm convinced he wouldn't care about my feelings and say a bunch of hurtful things again.

I recently realized how holding onto this family secret has negatively affected my life and that it's finally time to confront him. I planned on have a private dinner where I would tell him what I know and ask him to confess to my siblings too, since I'm confident that I'm the only one of the three of us who knows. Where I fear I will be the asshole is that I plan on doing it before a family trip. It has come to my attention that we might be meeting my dad's wife's family on this trip, which is where I draw the line. I have managed to get away with not meeting them before, and I would like it to stay that way because I do not view his wife or her family as my family because of his cheating (I even refuse to call her my stepmom). A part of me is worried that this will cause me to have an outburst on the trip, which further cemented to me why it's time to have this secret out in the open, and that it should happen before we leave. I’m worried, however, that doing it before the trip will cause a lot of tension and am wondering whether if it is better until after the trip to have this conversation.

Reading this back, I recognize I have a lot of issues, but I want to better myself and am hopeful that letting go of this secret will help put me on the right path of self-improvement.

2,WIBTA if I go against my mom’s wishes and contact Lily again?,"Lily is this girl who transferred to my school in the beginning of 2022 and well, things got weird.

I have always been a bit of a loner and a nerd, we became friends but she wasn’t exactly a good influence on me according to my mom and I think that’s fair, she got me to start skipping class to be with her, we got into places we weren’t allowed to be in as a dare.

look you get the gist of it, a lot of stuff happened that im not proud of and I wont sti through all of it,  well one day after finding out I was skipping class for her through the school  my mom forbid me from talking to Lily but honestly I didn’t care, then one Friday night I lied about where I was going and went out with her and some of her friends.

anyways we did something very stupid, I won’t say what, but Lily and I both got caught and ended pointing fingers at each other even though it was definitely both our faults but mostly hers.

I had to call my parents to get me out of potential legal trouble and so they did, Lily and I never talked after that as I blocked her on social media, she left the school both because of what happened and some things I had nothing to do with and I got out with the equivalent of a slap in the wrist.

about two months later she messaged me apologizing and saying she was wrong to try to pin everything on me, I replied that I forgive her but never told my parents that she messaged me because they 100% forbid me from talking to her and still they do this day, i’ve worked hard to earn back their trust.

but the truth is, im a loner in school and I miss Lily more then I would like to admit, she was a genuine friend despite everything.

3,AITA for yelling at my bf that I am not a perfect souffle?,"New account since this is my first time on reddit

I (28NB) love and am living with my bf (30M). For some context my bf loves to bake. I support him with it since he gets to do what he loves and I get to eat his yummy food. His favorite dish to make is a chocolate souffle which is great seeing as I love chocolate souffles. However, lately he's been calling me his perfect souffle and that I'm just perfect the way I am. We have just started trying for a baby and him calling me 'perfect' made me feel insecure as he had commitment issues in the past that he has been in therapy for 5 years for it. One day after going to the doctor and making sure everything is ok, I'm not feeling well and he comes in. He washes up then comes behind me and calls me perfect again. At this point I lost my temper and asked him if he didn't want us to be trying for a baby because my body will be different when I get pregnant? He went quiet and told me he was just trying to tell me that he appreciated me and my body before I got pregnant and insecure about my body. I felt really bad seeing as he was trying to do something sweet but went about it making me feel bad. I apologized and he accepted it but something still feels off. My sister told me I should upload her so Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: Thank you all for the comments. I realize how unfair I was to my bf so I apologized to him again and we had a really long talk. Good news is that I found out I'm pregnant (yay!) so we are getting ready for that.

4,AITA for assuming my boyfriend was letting his boss listen to our private phone call?,"I (25M) and my bf (28M) have been together for 6 years. I have autism spectrum disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, so sometimes my reactions to changed plans/unexpected roadblocks are kinda big. It’s something I’m very much not proud of and I’m in therapy, on medication and on my path to healing.

This morning, something big happened that would’ve cost me my job if I hadn’t fixed it. Since I was still at home, I called my bf to see if he had any idea how it happened and any insight on how to fix it. I will admit that I was very anxious at this point, sort of word vomiting. At one point I said “I’m going to get fired” and I heard his boss in the background say “(bf’s name) you always say you’re going to get fired whenever you do something like this”
I quickly told him I had to go, I loved him, and hung up. I later texted him “I’d appreciate if you didn’t let your boss listen to emotional conversations. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I was going to be on speaker and it’s absolutely mortifying that your boss that.”

He responded back with something like “he gathered context from my end of the conversation.”

I told him that he’d repeated what I said and that it didn’t make much sense, and he told me it was fine if I continued to think he was lying even though he wouldn’t do that to me.

I trust him and I don’t think he was lying. I apologized and we made up, but now I feel pretty bad that I went and overreacted like that.

5,AITA for not letting my family adopt a pet?,"2 years ago my dog died, she was very important to me and I broke down when it happened.
I'm currently 20yo and my 2 little sisters are 17 and 15
I still live with my parents and I plan to move in about 2 years.
Few months after my dog died, my sister brought up the idea of bringing a new dog to the family, I strongly disagreed because I didn't want to replace my dog but the real reason is that seeing other pets just make me ferious. I don't know how to explain it but I used to like pets and since then I really try to avoid them, but having them in my house (for example when my sister takes care of her friend's dog for few days when they are on vacation) makes me really furious and I hold myself from bursting out. Its reaching the point where I try to avoid coming back to my own house when I know there is a pet there.

Until now my mom respected my disagreement and didn't bring a dog no matter how much my sisters begged. But now my sister started feeding a stray cat that wandered to our garden, she named him and let him in the house a little. Even my big brother (22yo) started liking him which makes me even more mad since he had absolutely no affection to my dog unlike my 2 sisters who loved her.

Now everytime I see this cat I hiss him away and don't let him in the house when he tries to enter. My entire family yells at me to stop it but I just can't.
My sisters say they really want their own pet before they leave the house.
So am I the asshole for ruining every chance they have of it? I hate it when they say they want their own pet because my dog was theirs too and they loved her.
I am barely in the house because I work late but I don't want to come back to a house with a pet that will just make me angry all the time (even just thinking about a pet in the house makes me mad, I don't have to be in the same room with it)",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Title: AITA for not letting my family adopt a pet?","2 years ago my dog died, she was very important to me and I broke down when it happened.

6,AITA for showing up to my stepbrother's party uninvited?,"I (19M) have a stepbro (21M) called ""Justin"" (not his real name). Justin came into my life when my mom and dad had a messy divorce. My mom remarried a year after they divorced and married my stepdad, Brady and Brady has a son who is Justin.

Brady is a jerk because he always yells at me when my mom isn't around but when my mom was around he acted like the world's greatest dad. I wanted to be Justin's friend but Justin was cold towards me and he acted rudely. And when I was 17 I figured out the reason Justin hated me, Brady had told him lies about me. So after I moved out at 18, we haven't spoken to each other again.

Here's where the problem starts. One of my friends (17F) called Emily wanted to go to a party. I had a crush on Emily at the time and I wanted to go with her until I found out the host was Justin.  I decided to be polite and not be rude, so I found his phone number online and contacted him.

I called asking if I could get an invite and he said no and hung up immediately. I was fuming with rage because I wanted to confess my feelings at the party, so I decided to show up anyway with Emily and as I was professing my love for her.  Justin locked eyes with me and started yelling at me for being an ass and showing up uninvited.

I ended up ignoring him and continued to spend time with Emily but Justin ended up YELLING AT me and kicked me out. I left with Emily but Emily refused to go with me so I said ""WELL THEN YOU ARE NOT GETTING A RIDE HOME!!""

Emily and Justin aren't speaking to me,  and I regretted it deeply.

UPDATE: I realize I am in the wrong. I apologized to both Emily and Justin, but Justin didn't forgive me. Whatever he is an ass anyways.

7,AITA for asking my boyfriend to take off his work vest while were out shopping?,"today my boyfriend (25M) and i (21F) went to eat udon at an asian marketplace. he works in a warehouse and is required to wear one of those neon yellow standard safety vests. he usually keeps it on after work whether were going to wait in line at chipotle, hang out at the park, walk around somewhere, he really does not take it off till he gets home, and today was no different. he picked me up after his shift and we headed to our destination. once we got there, i asked if he could take it off, because he’s already clocked out, why keep it on? the color is also an eyesore for me, but i digress. 

he eventually took it off, but didnt like that i asked for him to, he lost his appetite while we were eating and hardly took a bite of his food. he responded saying he already feels he looks bad after work, so keeping it on sends the signal to other people that “oh, he just got off of work, thats why he looks like shit”. which i had trouble understanding. i can understand feeling like shit after work, but leaning into it while were at a date? in public? he then asked if i was embarrassed by him, which was hard to answer because he and his job do not embarrass me, he makes way more money than i do at the warehouse than i do bartending and being a receptionist. its really just the neon vest constantly making an appearance when were out together, but AITA for asking him to take it off?

8,AITA for telling my parent she doesn't care?,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing well

To give context, I've fallen behind on school. I've failed my highschool finals twice already and it appears I need to pay around 50 something to USD which is 1/12 of my parents monthly income where I live. The calculation is all approximate

I don't mean to victimize myself, I know I'm partially at fault too, probably. Or could have made better decisions. I've been feeling quite depressed ever since high school began and pandemic only contributed to my degradation of skills. My mom however barely understands me and usually just tells me I shouldn't give up etc. etc. while I really struggle to understand what matters to me

Therapy isn't an option nor available here otherwise I would take that route already 

Anyways, when I talked about the money to my mother, she got very angry with me. Told me she doesn't care about my exams and I'm not worth it anymore and that I'm on my own. That I'll be failing again so she doesn't want to bother. And in response I've told her she doesn't actually care about me and why did she even had a child in the first place. It mostly hit me because she told me she'd lend me money if I ever needed it to stand on my own feet before this

Our relationship was already in fluctuations and that didn't help. She keeps making snarky comments that just make me want her to not come home at all. Both parents go to work and often I'm the one at home doing chores, buying groceries, etc. 
Just *one day* I forgot to go for it and she got mad, made comments about how lazy and ignorant I am about everything

And later on she admitted: ""We've done it all for you all the time, only once I'm not going to step in and you're an ungrateful brat. Keep this on that account"" in regards to her snarky comment

I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen to me and how I can ever handle life.  I'll probably end up working if they don't pay for me. Although I'll try my best to not leech off of them as early as I can

I hear others who've gone to work since they were 15, save up or pay for themselves, or others who are progressing in their lives and kind to their parents even if they are passive aggressive. Some are my friends. I feel so useless compared to my peers

I hear others who've gone to work since they were 15, save up or pay for themselves, or others who are progressing in their lives and kind to their parents even if they are passive aggressive. Some are my friends. I feel so useless compared to my peers

And I'm wondering what a thrid perspective thinks. Do I have a victim complex and it's my fault I'm lazy, or maybe it's not totally on me or on mom"
9,AITA for scrolling far back through my boyfriend’s messages when he allowed me to?,"While my boyfriend of 3 years was replying to someone, I noticed he was replying to a name that I was unfamiliar with. I casually asked and he told me that it was the co-worker that he had been telling me that he made friends with at work. I knew about the coworker though I couldn’t remember him telling me what the name of this co-worker was or that if I even asked.  I jokingly pretended to be suspicious about their relationship and tried to test how he would react if ever I wanted to read their messages. He gladly gave me his phone and opened the messages for me to see. 


I felt relieved that he willingly did that so I was just trying to scroll up trying to load up all the messages though I didn’t really have the intention of reading them. I was only curious as to when they started chatting. The more I scrolled, the more I realized that they talked almost everyday, although mostly it’s work-related, I saw memes and banter going on here and there. I didn’t exactly read the messages as I scrolled up but I can see glimpses of what they talked about. I started to feel sad, because I realized on some days when we wouldn’t be talking, they would be and it would be a lot of talking. My insecurity flared up and I started telling him how they talk a lot and all. He then suddenly was mad all of a sudden and was accusing me of having no trust in him. I asked him when they started talking and he said he doesn’t remember. I thought after scrolling a lot that I couldn’t pinpoint when they did because there were just too many messages to load, so I just gave up and gave him his phone. Afterwards, he started acting cold and would not talk to me even when I offered for us to reconcile. AITA for what I did?


A little background as to why I acted the way I did:
Me and my boyfriend went through a rough patch a year ago because he admitted to me that he fell in love with his close female friend. Despite this, I forgave him because he came clean to me and he cut her off to save our relationship. He never cheated with her or anything, but it was more like a one-sided crush that turned into something worse on his part. Since then, we established boundaries, especially friendship with female friends on his part as to not blur the lines anymore in terms of friendship.


Also, another side note:
I never monitor messages in his phone in secret. This is an isolated case wherein I just casually asked out of the blue about this random message because I happen to see him reply while I was sitting next to him.",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Title: AITA for scrolling far back through my boyfriend’s messages when he allowed me to?","While my boyfriend of 3 years was replying to someone, I noticed he was replying to a name that I was unfamiliar with.

10,AITA for yelling at my mom who slept with my friend?,"So recently my mother (35-38F) was in my town. (She lives quite a bit away.) While she was in town, she apparently went to the local bar where my friend (30FTM) was. 

Now it’s important to note I used to work there so I basically know everyone there and my brother even works there currently. 

My friend, I’ll call them B, told my friend (19F, calling her E) that they had slept with my mother and didn’t know it was her until like the day after. 

After E told me, I was obviously upset so I called my mother. She answered and I just started yelling at her. I can admit that was not one of my better moments… but you find out your mother slept with one of your friends and you’d be pissed too. 

So, while on the phone with my mother, she told me that I “cant control what she does” and “I should get friends my own age.”

Note: i’ve been friends with people 3+ years older than me since i was like 13 😭. 

Another note: my mother is a lesbian and doesn’t know about B transitioning and has stated before she doesn’t want to be in a relationship with someone transitioning as it’s too much for her to handle both their mental health and her own. She’s not transphobic or homophobic I can tell you that. 

My friend E has told me I am not the asshole, however since talking to my mother about what she did I have barely talked to my mother. I told her she could pursue a relationship with MY friend or talk to me, but I would not be talking to her if she pursues a relationship with my friend. Texts here and there for doctor appointments. I also haven’t talked to my friend, B. AITA for this?

EDIT: feedback said i am TA, but i’d like to note my friend (B, 30) was bragging about it to the bartenders and the other staff. This person has a history of creating drama and making the attention go to them when it’s not on them.

Edit: i’m 16 F

11,AITA for refusing to consider people who were not wearing costumes for a costume party?,"My organization on campus always hosts a huge Halloween party. I have been every year since I was a freshman and given that I am a senior this year it was my opportunity to help plan it.

I was asked to handle the costume contest. I was the head judge. The way it works is that all the other organizations choose one member of their group to submit for the best costume and we pick one male org and one female org member to win.

In past years, I have never particularly liked how the costumes were judged. The male costumes were always good, but the female costumes were just not great. They went with the typical girl Halloween costume. We always had some girls that show up in real costumes and not just string and a prop. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn’t be winning the costume contest.

So the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.

We looked at each contestant and we’re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.

This girl was in a Trixie Tang costume from
Fairly Odd Parents. The other judge was not a fan of it so she did not want her to win. But all the other girls weren’t in costumes. We debated it before I said that I would just say whoever she said was the winner to get her to shut her mouth. This was a lie and when I announced the winner, I explicitly said that Trixie Tang won because she has the best actual costume of all of the lady entries.

The other judge was mad and the girls from the losing groups were not happy. They said I judged unfairly. The president of my org co-signed my decision and said that the outcome was fine. We awarded the prize and everything was cool, but after that, none of the girls from the orgs that lost wouldn’t talk to me. The other judge told me I was a dick and lied to her which I guess is true, but our house our rules and our près. Was cool with it.

12,AITA for asking my dying father to sell his house to me for cheap as a condition to see him before he dies?,"My (31F) father was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and doesn't have a lot of time left according to his wife, and they are struggling financially after paying for his wife's medical bills. 

I asked her to send me his reports because I wanted to verify everything before I engaged with them. 

Turns out she was saying the truth, and he is actually sick. Now as a condition of seeing him before he passes and helping him out financially, I asked him to sell my childhood home to me at 1/10th of its current market price. 

 I got it cheap. I refused to dole out easy money. The house means a lot to me, It's the house my mom picked out and it's the home I hope to raise my family in once I have kids. He  agreed, albeit reluctantly, because he has no other option right now. 

The sale has gone through and the house is legally mine now. The money he got from the sale will help him get proper hospice care. 

I will be flying out to another country in a few weeks, but his wife is insisting I stay and help her out with some of his care.

 His wife is accusing me of cheating a dying man of his money and being a selfish prick. But has has already seen me. I visited him and helped him out financially by buying the house. I held up my end of the bargain.

13,AITA for bringing up the past with someone who's sick?,"Two years ago, I was at the end of a professional training programme and one of my appraisals went very badly (I was essentially held back due to a lack of progression - those good at math may be able to link this timing to a global health problem where disruption could have impacted on my training goals).

One of the appraisers made a very personal comment about me and my lack of progression to the others on the team - which was then repeated back to me (seemingly by mistake?). It was highly insulting and I was very concerned about the reputational damage that could be caused from such a comment - but I was a trainee and not in a position to challenge it. I don't think that the person who made the comment ever found out that I was told what she had said.

In the end, I managed to finish my training. I recently reached out to the person who made the comment and they were very happy to hear from me (I think they thought I wanted to catch up). But I asked them about what they said and what really did they mean by it. They immediately distanced themselves from the comment and talked about they had retired and were unwell, but that I was a good worker and that they hoped their response was satisfactory.

I responded that it wasn't. That the comment was given to me as part of formal feedback but that they had failed to address it in their email. I just got back an email saying that due to their health concerns and the fact that it's been two years, that they can't help me.

I'm not going to push further - I don't know what the health problems are but I do feel guilty for pushing this on someone unwell. I didn't know they were sick when I struck up the exchange, but I did know that they were retired.

15,AITA for telling my kids babysitter that it was inappropriate of her to shower in my home?,"

I hired a babysitter for my 5 and 3 year old kids 2 weeks ago. My husband works shifts while I work long hours at a marketing company.


So far we've had no issues til yesterday. I came home at 6pm and noticed the babysitter's wet hair and new clothes. She told me she took a shower after one of the kids spilled milk on her. I was confused but visibly upset but she tried to ""reassure"" me the kids were fine, because my husband watched them while she took her shower which only lasted for few minutes. I was more confused that my husband was home when he had a shift to cover. I told her I didn't think it was appropriate of her to shower in my home like that. She argued that it was fine and that she had no choice and couldn't leave the milk on her like that. We argued and my husband heard the commotion and got involved. He said it was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be but I told the babysitter that I did not appreciate how she basically ignored how I felt about this and dismissed my feelings still. She went home, but we still argued on the phone. She thinks she's done nothing wrong and said I was being unfair when I mentioned potentially cutting from her salary after that.


My husband keeps saying that I'm overreacting and the ""poor girl"" couldn't handle having milk stains on her body and clothes. But I couldn't help feel it was inappropriate and she shouldve checked with me.



AITA for my reaction? Just for info. I'm the one who pays her, not my husband. I told her to call or text (always available) if anything happens. I didn't even know my husband was home at the time! If you noticed, I said that I argued with her even before she told me my husband was home. And no I didn't know how big the stain was but she argued about being covered in milk for 6+hrs. As for the question of why my husband didn't go to work? He said he was feeling a bit sick and swapped shifts with a coworker.

16,AITA For Not Paying Rent when being denied basic comforts?,"I have lived with my (ex) friend for 5 years now.  I was staying at the salvation army and she opened up her guest room to me for a few hundred a month.  This was supposed to be a month or so long arrangement but life got hectic.  This house has two bathrooms.  One is completely functional and modern.  The other one is not functional and needs remodeled.  I mean, the shower and toilet don't even work.  The sink works but no one ever uses it.  My former friend, I will call her FF, owns the house.  She has been saying for years she is trying to save the money to fix everything in that bathroom and it hasn't gotten done yet.  So last year I stopped paying rent except for when she hounds me about it and then I give her a little money to shut her up.  I'm sick of living in this house where I can't take a bath and have only a standup shower and don't have my own bathroom.

In the last 12 months she has gotten 3 tattoos and she went on a cross country road trip with her brother.  When I call her out on this stuff she just makes excuses like, ""It's gonna cost about 3 grand to do that bathroom.  I'm trying to save up the money but there are other bills and stuff that are just a higher priority.""  She has about $500 in the bathroom fund right now.  Yesterday she even had the audacity to blame me and say maybe if I paid rent she would have more money for the bathroom remodel.  She said I make more money than she does and it's ridiculous that she's supporting me.  She also sent some sappy text about how this is really hurting her a lot because 20 years of friendship are basically ruined and all she did was try to help me.  Whatever.

Well I think it's ridiculous that I can't even take a bubble bath while paying to live here but she can get tats and go on cross country trips.  Over the summer she told me she couldn't afford to turn the AC on either unless I start contributing more.  She said the AC raises the electric bill by $50 a month and she needs me to help if I want it on.   I'm sick of being denied basic comforts while she can get tats and go on trips.

We live somewhere where the cost of living is pretty high if anyone is question why 2 grown women are living together.",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Title: AITA For Not Paying Rent when being denied basic comforts?","I have lived with my (ex) friend for 5 years now.  I was staying at the salvation army and she opened up her guest room to me for a few hundred a month.  This was supposed to be a month or so long arrangement but life got hectic.  This house has two bathrooms.  One is completely functional and modern.  The other one is not functional and needs remodeled.  I mean, the shower and toilet don't even work.  The sink works but no one ever uses it.  My former friend, I will call her FF, owns the house.  She has been saying for years she is trying to save the money to fix everything in that bathroom and it hasn't gotten done yet.  So last year I stopped paying rent except for when she hounds me about it and then I give her a little money to shut her up.  I'm sick of living in this house where I can't take a bath and have only a standup shower and don't have my own bathroom.

In the last 12 months she has gotten 3 tattoos and she went on a cross country road trip with her brother.  When I call her out on this stuff she just makes excuses like, ""It's gonna cost about 3 grand to do that bathroom.  I'm trying to save up the money but there are other bills and stuff that are just a higher priority.""  She has about $500 in the bathroom fund right now.  Yesterday she even had the audacity to blame me and say maybe if I paid rent she would have more money for the bathroom remodel.  She said I make more money than she does and it's ridiculous that she's supporting me.  She also sent some sappy text about how this is really hurting her a lot because 20 years of friendship are basically ruined and all she did was try to help me.  Whatever.

Well I think it's ridiculous that I can't even take a bubble bath while paying to live here but she can get tats and go on cross country trips.  Over the summer she told me she couldn't afford to turn the AC on either unless I start contributing more.  She said the AC raises the electric bill by $50 a month and she needs me to help if I want it on.   I'm sick of being denied basic comforts while she can get tats and go on trips.

18,AITA for giving my husband the green light to accept his mom's lavish gifts when she gives our children shitty ones?,"My MIL is a very difficult woman. She has struggled a lot with the transition of her kids having kids, as she only views her family as her husband and kids, and does not like ""having a grandmother role forced on her"" When my oldest was born I was naive and thought MIL would help out. I learned that the hard way. She didn't want to do family holidays and just wanted to be alone with her husband, stopped doing family vacations. Honestly I thought it was just because she doesn't like me, but she loves her son in law and isn't any more interested in their children.

I will admit this hurt me and I set pretty harsh boundaries. One of the boundaries was that my husband could not accept gifts from MIL. She would always get him really nice birthday and Christmas gifts and get our kids cheap impersonal junk. MIL's gifts to him were always experiences or hobby related things as he grew up wealthy but does not make the kind of money he grew up with, and she feels he doesn't treat himself enough. Six years ago we told MIL that he would no longer be accepting these gifts as he is a husband and father first, and it isn't right.

Well my husband has been struggling with some depression lately. One of his biggest things is he feels like he is just a husband and father and lost his identity. He feels he gives constantly and gets very little back. I hate seeing him like this, so I called MIL and asked if she wanted to resume giving him gifts and said I would no longer stand in the way.

Well he had a birthday recently and MIL bought him something for his hobby (probably a $10,000-12,000 bike according to the internet) and gave him some gift cards so he could take a weekend away to his favorite trails. I could see how much it meant to him and felt I made the right decision, but my daughter blew up.

She said I was being unfair to her by allowing MIL to flaunt how selfish she is, and that he should stand strong and say there will be no gifts until she can buy gifts for the family. She said she was disappointed in my lack of a backbone and disappointed in her dad. I saw my husband's face fall and told him it was ok and I didn't regret my choice, but our daughter was cold the rest of the night. The last gift MIL gave her was a tiny makeup pallet she probably picked up in line.

It wasn't an easy choice, and despite living here we have completely separate finances. MIL made it clear she would not be paying for anything for us, cooking for us, and didn't want us in her space. That is fine. We have been buying all of our own food and avoiding her as much as possible.

MIL recently started bringing her new boyfriend ""Ken"" around. At first he was very nice and seemed surprised at how we lived. We seemed to want to fix MILs relationship with my husband, and offered to buy more food so we could eat, and invited us out a couple times.

I really liked Ken at first, but then he changed overnight. MIL mentioned something about the time she was alone on Christmas, and he asked why she was alone on Christmas. MIL explained it was right after FIL left and it was our Christmas to be with my parents. She also said she was depressed because her birthday is the week and she had just turned 40, and he looked at us in disgust and asked why wouldn't we change plans based on the circumstances.

Before we could even explain he called my husband a piece of shit and said clearly I control him and he isn't man enough to do anything about it. Since then Ken has been really mean. He won't talk to us, rolls his eyes if we talk at all. He's been spending a lot more time here lately and bringing his dog which we are not allowed to pet.

21,AITA for talking behind my friends back?,"For context, I became best friends with this person in elementary school but they moved a couple times back and forth so we were only together for like 2 school years. We were in a friend group and almost everyone would basically obsess and worship over her it wasn’t healthy, almost all of them ended up dating her and they were all super toxic to me and her which ruined both our mental health in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL and sent us both spiraling downhill.

Years later she lives in Kentucky and we don’t speak to any of the people in that friend group except for each other but in the past years she’s been going down a hill of despair. She would date basically everyone, vape, she’s even do inappropriate stuff with her lover in public. (I was not around but her friends were talking about it.)

22,AITA for pranking my brother,"The title is really oversimplified, just a heads up. 

I (M18) have spent the past three ish years living with my dad's ex (lets call her Jane) (she's not my mom, her and my dad were together way before I was born) because I was pretty sick ahd her family's incredibly rich and has like a million doctors so they could give me better access to better treatment. The original plan was that I would just go with her family and my dad would join me afterwards once he got work stuff sorted, but the pandemic  got in the way and made it harder for my dad to join me afterwards since I am immunocompromised and he wasn't in a position to be isolated with me. I'd rather not go too much into the specifics of it all but what you need to know is that I hadn't seen my dad in person for over a year before this week.

During the period of time that I was gone, my dad took in a different kid (M16) since he's registered as a foster parent. Since then, he's adopted the kid. And I had a lot of differing emotions over it when I first found out, and also a lot of time to sit with them. I've spoken to him over the phone a couple of times, but never in person.  

Anyways, I got the news that I would finally be able to go home a little while ago, and decided that I would surprise my dad (and new brother) with it. It's not entirely a surprise in the sense that my dad was aware I've been getting better and would be getting home sometime late October/early November, it's just a surprise in the sense that he wouldn't know the exact moment I'd get home. So, Jane agreed to help me arrange it and all, and I ended up deciding I'd prank my brother when I got there. Nothing too bad, just make him think the house is a little haunted before revealing myself. He'd mentioned that the house *felt* like it should have a ghost or two, so I found it fitting. 

I did just that yesterday, and it was pretty fun. I got to finally meet my brother and actually prank him in the process, which I thought was normal brother stuff? IDK, never had a brother before. But IDK, I suppose he was more spooked than intended cause my dad's reaction upon seeing me was just to scold me for ""trying to run off"" the kid. Not my intention at all, but yeah, was told it just made it seem like I wanted him gone. 

And, listen, okay, maybe a prank wasn't the best first impression, but I really don't think it's a big enough deal that I don't even get a welcome here, you know?

I feel like it’s not that big of a deal considering I’m still going and I’m going to other events plus I never miss big family events. I love my family and of course I want to spend time with them and I haven’t made a full decision yet I just want to know if I’m being a jerk. I would like to add my mom also thinks it’s crappy that I’m going and leaving very shortly afterwards idk I try to do what I can to balance friends and family and I probably don’t do the best sometimes but I want an outside opinion please and thank you. So am I the asshole?"
24,AITA for ditching a concert I didn't want to go to with a childhood friend to see another childhood friend for the first time,"I (F19 at the time) had planned to go to a concert with my friend Rebecca (F19), around the same time our mutual friend Jason (M19), came home from his Mormon mission after two years. 
After some deliberation I decided that spending time with Jason was more important than going to a country concert that I didn’t even really want to go to in the first place. 
Rebecca decided to go to the concert without me which was all fine until I found out she took her mom with her using my ticket that I paid over $400 for (she bought the tickets so they were all in her name but I sent her money to pay for my ticket) 
After the concert was over I messaged Rebecca to say that there was no rush on paying me back for the ticket but that the total amount was $400 (I had also already paid for the hotel but I let her off on that). 
She then told me that I forfeited the right to the ticket when I left her hanging and that she had to bring her mom so she didn’t have to miss the concert. 
I had tried to sell the ticket a week or two before the event but wasn’t able to. I told her that if no one bought it I’d take the hit. But her mom used the ticket so I told her that her mom should have to pay for the ticket. 
Rebecca disagreed because I said I was ok taking the loss if I couldn’t get anyone to buy the ticket.

25,AITA for getting involved in my friends problem,"Both my friends think I’m a huge asswipe after this and I just want another opinion 
So at the start of the school year my school sent us on a big trip and a girl 2 grades younger than us fell for my buddy and we’ll shit went down to say the least. Buddy 2 is friends with this girl and talks to her after the whole fiasco and him and buddy 1 start drifting away from each other.
Now I don’t want my two best friends to stop being friends so I start trying to intervene.
Now buddy 2 is acting all high and mighty because he started talking to a few girls and it pisses buddy 1 off.
Now to last week or so I try to get them to talk it out and they won’t.
Today I got in a big argument with buddy 2 and I brought up that buddy 1 is uncomfortable with this girl from the trip who buddy 2 is friends with hanging with us at lunch, for reference we go to a tiny school with about 30 people per grade.
Buddy 2 sent a message to her saying that she can’t hang with us as a group at lunch anymore because it makes buddy 1 uncomfortable and I haven’t told anyone but she also makes me uncomfortable because she reminds me a bit too much of my ex.
Now buddy 1 and 2 are pissed at me for getting involved in their problem.
My logic for getting involved was that these two are very non confrontational ffs my friend had to tell the girl that it was weird for her to be flirty with buddy 1.

26,AITA for not feeling comfortable paying for a whole weekend trip with friends if I only stayed 1 day due to a difficult financial situation?,"*not from the US or a native speaker so apologies for any grammar mistakes!

This weekend, a group of university friends organized a weekend trip staying at a small cottage near the sea.

Due to a difficult financial situation: incredibly high inflation, increased rent and a astonishingly high utilities bill, I decided to only stay for one night so I could join them but still be economically responsible.

In hindsight, I should have let the whole group (20+ people) know that my decision to join one night was financially motivated but I’m not close with some people since I haven’t seen some of them in a few years. Furthermore, I didn’t anticipate what would happen.

It was decided that the whole bill (accommodation and groceries) would be split over everyone even though half the group stayed one night like me and the rest were there the whole weekend.

When I made my discomfort know about this decision know, I was told: “you chose to stay one night so you have to pay everything.” And to not be “difficult because it is too hard to calculate the bill.” I actually broke down crying as I have been incredibly stressed out by my financial situation. But I was I was told to just “suck it up.”

*EDIT: I see see some responses saying I backed out at the last minute, however, before booking the house everyone including me made it known how long we were staying. Since equal amount of people either stayed Friday or Saturday night, there was no “empty” beds so to speak. 

Furthermore , the decision about how to split the costs was decided after the trip hence my surprise/distress about it. I assumed that the dinner groceries and bar drinks on the night before I arrived would be split over the people who were actually there. Just doesn’t seem to be fair to pay for food & drinks that I didn’t partake in.

27,AITA for being angry at my depressed spouse who lost their job?,"So my (F39) and spouse (M47) had a great job. WFH good salary, great benefits. We have a great house and four kids all under 16. Spouse has history of depression but is under a doctors care. The last year or so he started giving up working, spending most days taking naps or going golfing. 

I am a SAHM and we depend on his salary to live. 
I have told him numerous times that he can’t work like this because he could lose his job. I offered to help with the work or do anything that could increase his productivity. 

His boss fame gave him SO MANY chances to redeem himself and he would be excited for a bit, but the old habits soon enough resurfaced and it was back to missing meetings and assignments. 

Well as the title states, he got fired for not doing his job. We have bills that are pilling up, kids to feed, not to mention Santa is coming soon. COBRA insurance is insanely expensive but health care is a must. 

We are burning through our savings and I’m getting extremely nervous. He’s applying for jobs, but nothing has come through. 

So - AITA if I am angry and tell him so? I told him this would happen so many times and begged him to get his act together. I’m worried that if I express my anger it will only add to the stress he is under. I’m not sure what to do and I guess I am asking for advice and seeing if I am out of line.

28,AITA for saying I won't spend holidays with my family anymore if my mom won't let my fiancee help her cook?,"I've been with my fiancee ""Rosie"" for 4 years and we have always rotated holidays between our two families. In her family cooking is a big deal with all of the women in the kitchen (I know and have offered help, don't come for me) and they all take part and socialize while doing it.

In my family my mom does most of the cooking. My sisters might wander in and out and help, her husband might chop some vegetables, but it is really mainly her. Her MIL stays in the kitchen with her but apparently doesn't know how to cook, or sometimes she has a friend in there. We've offered my mom help and she has politely turned it down.

Rosie has been trying to get more involved for the past couple holidays and my mom has snubbed her. Rosie confided in me that she is getting frustrated and feels that she is going to be a member of the family and has the right to be included. I talked to my mom and she suggested Rosie bring a dish and they can reheat and serve it.

At this point Rosie felt like she was being totally snubbed. I talked to my mom again and she confided in me that she finds Rosie annoying and doesn't want to be forced to spend that much time with her, and it would ""ruin"" her holidays.

30,AITA for being upset that a friend decided to run against me in an election?,"For a bit of background context first: I have dedicated admittedly way more of my life in the past year than what would be considered healthy to my nursing union. I’ve held two officer positions, created & managed a very successful social media account for the union, led the planning for our recent picket, got us tons of news/media coverage, & served on our bargaining team. I became friends with a nurse who decided to serve on our bargaining team this year. She has been a nurse in our union for almost 20 years, but this was her official first involvement with the union. I have only been a nurse for 4 years but have been involved since year 2. I have had numerous conversations with her over the last few months where I literally begged her to consider becoming more involved as an officer once our bargaining season was up. 

One of our current co-chairs announced she is retiring and I have made my intentions of going for that role extremely clear after I got the blessings of the other union officers and the other co-chair (about 4-6 months ago). So now this friend decided to run against me & the current co-chair, despite saying she wasn’t sure she had time to be involved. She is still telling people that she knows she can’t make it her top priority but she feels she needs to run because a few friends nominated her (and she self-nominated..). I tried explaining that this both hurt personally and professionally as well as that I genuinely think it is not wise as she has zero experience and would rely (I.e. lean) far too heavily on the co-chair. Things have turned pretty ugly. I respect that she has a right to run, but wow does it feel personal! I keep wavering on feeling like I’m being petty or justifiably angry…. So AITA?

31,AITA for not leaving work to let my kids facetime their dad before his surgery?,"

My ex husband and I are divorced. We share custody of our 5 & 3 years old kids together. He's been struggling with health issues for about a year now.

He had a surgery scheduled and asked if I'd let him have them the day before the surgery but I politely declined since it was my time to have them and any switch in schedule might affect my work.

The day of the surgery, His girlfriend called me from the hospital and put him on the phone. He asked how I was doing (basically his go-to method to ask for something) then asked if I could let the kids facetime him before he went into surgery. I said I was at work but he asked if I could take a break, go home and let the children facetime him for 10 minutes. I said I was sorry but refused. I promised I'd have the kids see him post surgery but he started arguing with me. He said that it was unfair enough I didn't let him have the kids the day before and that he felt like facetiming them before the surgery was reasonable enough. I had to end the call since there was so much commotion for my coworkers to hear. His girlfriend called back but I refused to respond.

I got off work at 7pm and his girlfriend called asking if ""I was happy"". and said that he literally cried after the call was ended and after I refused to do what he asked. She called me unbelieveable and spiteful for having no consideration for my kids if not their dad and what he's going through. I said I wasn't going to interrupt work when I was already busy. She said that I was making excuses and that she ""felt sorry"" for the kids implying I was being deliberately hurtful in my behavior which I'm not! It's just that I had to work.

32,AITA for breaking a coworkers space heater that was making my space so hot and was not allowed but HR refused to intervene and tell her to get rid of it?,"I have a coworker named “Debbie” who is I swear is poured into a mold and works at every office. Indeterminate aged overweight woman who is decent enough at her job and organizes all the office parties so she won’t get fired but at the same time nearly zero interpersonal skills and is the office gossip. 

It’s started to get cooler (yet far from cold) and Debbie brought in a space heater for under her desk. They are specifically prohibited in our office policy btw. Debbie would crank this thing up and though I’m on the other side of the cubicle, the space at my feet would feel like it was molten lava. I asked Debbie to turn it off, she said no that her feet have poor circulation so she needs the heater. I said maybe she could wear socks. She said they didn’t go her her heels. I said so you’re not turning the heater off would she compromise and maybe use it just part of the day instead of full blast all day. 

I went to HR and they said they “talked” with Debbie but there was nothing they could do and with their audit coming up they have bigger fish to fry and advised me to “wait it out” and maybe it won’t be so uncomfortable in the winter. 

Debbie was gone all day yesterday and left her heater on. I couldn’t take it anymore so I took a screwdriver and broke the heating coil. Debbie got back and like a true idiot she couldn’t figure out what was going on. I guess this heater was like 60 years old and the replacement she found on Amazon is a tower heater which won’t fit under her desk. My problem is solved but her cubicle mates are in for hell.

I told my wife what I did and she said that we need to apologize to Debbie and replace her heater with one that works for her. She said what I did was really terrible and there are ways to handle these things. I told her I may be an asshole for breaking it but I’m not replacing it to cause me more grief.

It’s started to get cooler (yet far from cold) and Debbie brought in a space heater for under her desk. They are specifically prohibited in our office policy btw. Debbie would crank this thing up and though I’m on the other side of the cubicle, the space at my feet would feel like it was molten lava. I asked Debbie to turn it off, she said no that her feet have poor circulation so she needs the heater. I said maybe she could wear socks. She said they didn’t go her her heels. I said so you’re not turning the heater off would she compromise and maybe use it just part of the day instead of full blast all day. 

I went to HR and they said they “talked” with Debbie but there was nothing they could do and with their audit coming up they have bigger fish to fry and advised me to “wait it out” and maybe it won’t be so uncomfortable in the winter. 

Debbie was gone all day yesterday and left her heater on. I couldn’t take it anymore so I took a screwdriver and broke the heating coil. Debbie got back and like a true idiot she couldn’t figure out what was going on. I guess this heater was like 60 years old and the replacement she found on Amazon is a tower heater which won’t fit under her desk. My problem is solved but her cubicle mates are in for hell.

I told my wife what I did and she said that we need to apologize to Debbie and replace her heater with one that works for her. She said what I did was really terrible and there are ways to handle these things. I told her I may be an asshole for breaking it but I’m not replacing it to cause me more grief.

33,AITA for announcing my pregnancy at my sisters wedding?,"fake names, throwaway account.

My (25f) sister, Elsa (32f) invited me to her wedding. Then, she went on a vacation where she had no cell service. My other sister, Anna (29f), told me she had kept in contact with Elsa thru mail (I move around a lot and it's hard to get a current address with me.).

Around 2 months ago, I found out I was pregnant. I told Anna, and asked her to tell Elsa. She agreed, and later, she said Elsa wanted me to announce it at her wedding so it would be double the fun. I happily agreed.

During the reception, I stood up and announced I was pregnant. Everyone was excited for me, but Elsa. She started weeping and called me an asshole.

I confronted Anna. She confessed that she had fought with Elsa before her vacation and she wasn't mailing her anything. Anna wanted to ruin Elsa's wedding and I was an unwitting accomplice. I went to apoligize to Elsa and told her the whole story. Luckily, she forgave me.

I realize that the timeline was sketchy, since the letters were delivered and came back within 2 weeks. Also, I could have followed basic wedding ettiquite and not announced my pregnancy at her wedding, even if she had said it was ok.

AITA?

Edit: I did check with ""Elsa"" to see what time I should announce it. After Elsa came back from vacation, she went into wedding planning mode and it was impossible to get ahold of her.

34,AITA for refusing to pay the veterinary bills for a dog my dog mauled?,"Throwaway. 

I rescued my dog from a rescue a few months ago, they let me know he does not get along with other dogs so I have taken care to avoid him being around other dogs. I have not yet seen him interact with other dogs due to this.
I tend to walk him at night around 9 or 10 pm as there’s usually no one outside at this time, so I don’t have to try to dodge all the other dogs being walked in the neighborhood. 

My dog was on a leash, we were walking at a brisk pace and as we turned a corner, to my surprise we nearly ran into another couple walking their small chihuahua-like dog. My dog LUNGED for their dog with a speed and ferocity that caught me off guard, the leash slipped from my hands and my dog attacked their dog. My dog is a good sized boxer/lab mix (although he could just be a pitbull mix and the rescue listed him as a boxer/lab to help with his adoption chances) and I feared he would legitimately kill the other dog. It was awful, we were all screaming, I managed to grab the leash and drag my dog away but some damage had definitely been done. 
I exchanged contact info with the owners and they rushed him to the ER. I originally wanted to do the right thing and help pay for medical bills. I live in a high COL area and I figured it would be expensive, but they let me know the estimated cost to save their dog is at nearly twenty thousand dollars so far. And it could potentially increase.

I did not believe them at first, but they forwarded the estimate bill to me and offered to bring me to the hospital to see for myself. The price quote is real. The dog has broken ribs and is oxygen dependent, they want to give him at least one blood transfusion and hospitalise for several days. 

There is no world in which I can afford that. That’s ridiculous. I said I would pay for euthanasia or contribute 5k towards the bill. They argued with me saying it is my fault, which is true, but that amount is outlandish. It would technically not put me into debt, but it would make a serious dent in my savings. It is a about a fourth of my yearly take home pay after taxes.

36,AITA for walking my dog at the park?,"Throw away for privacy. Fake names.

I (37 F) decided a couple months ago with my husband (40 M) that it was time to get our kids a dog because they were old enough to care for one. My kids are Rose (8 F) and Isabella (10 F). My husband had a boxer as a kid and said that he has fond memories with that kind of dog so we decided to get one and surprise the kids. He is now five months old. I'm sure many of you will understand that because he is a puppy he needs a lot of exercise because he is very high energy. We often take him on walks at the park near our house because it has several very long walking paths.

Well, this past weekend there was an event going on at the lower half of the park, so it was closed off so all we had left was the top half. It was just me and my daughter Rose because my husband had to pick up Isabella from a friend's house. While at the park my daughter kept begging me to hold Coopers leash. After a while I gave in. While Rose was walking him another dog came by and Cooper got excited and started running over which pulled my daughter who let go of the leash. Cooper ran over to the other dog trying to play and all of a sudden I heard screaming at me to ""get my dog"". My daughter ran over and started crying while the girl (2oish F?) held her dog down with her arm in his mouth and screamed at me to stop standing there. The man with her started yelling at me to stop my dog who was jumping with excitement. After the shock wore off, I rushed over and removed my dog checking Cooper and Rose. The man with her started yelling at me that I was being irresponsible by letting the dog walk free in a leash required area and that people like them take their rescues there for training and I probably just destroyed months work of progress with their dog. I explained he was being held but my daughter dropped by accident and that he needed to stop yelling as it was scaring my kid. He started yelling that if my daughter wasn't strong enough to hold the dog she shouldn't be walking it or take it to a unleashed area to practice. When we got home Rose was still crying.

AITA for pretending to use sign language when a group of teens wanted a seat on the bus

As the title suggests, I “pretended” to use sign language to get out of giving up a seat to a group of teens. 

I (16m) was sitting on the bus and was using up two seats, one for me and one for my bag. This was about the time school lets out. 

My bus made a stop and a group of (i assume) teenagers got on. they were being very loud and obnoxious but  ignored them. They then made their way up to where i was sitting.  There were a couple of them asking if i could move my stuff so their friend could sit down.  I being fed up with the day decide to ignore them, thinking they would either stand or find somewhere else to sit.

A few second go by and i hear to my left “no need to be rude sofia the first” (i assume referencing to the TV show and  calling me a princess). They continue to try and get my attention. Eventually, one dude grabs my book bag and places it on top of my lap and then sits in the seat next to me. 

I’m trying to find a way to get out of this situation when the dude says “if she has a problem then we can fight!” I wanting no issues decide to sign at the guy “who are you”. 

side note: i am not deaf or hard of hearing. sign language was just the first language i was taught as a kid, so i know basic sentences. I also sometimes use ASL to communicate when i don’t feel like talking.

He then starts trying to apologise because he assumes i am deaf. He is like frantically asking siri “how to apologise in deaf language”. His friends are saying stuff like “you’re gonna go to hell”. 

Finally the bus pulls up to my stop and i motion that i have to get off. As i am stepping outside of the bus i half yell “have a nice day” and i turn back to see the same guy give me the middle finger.

The house we booked has a huge bunkroom that all of the girls were going to sleep in. There were 2 bunk beds with trundle beds underneath and a single bed.

40,WIBTA If I got a pet snake even though I know my roommate probably wouldn't like it?,"I want a pet. I don't have the time or the money for a dog and my roommate says she is allergic to cats. Sometimes I question if she's actually being honest about this or if she's just saying it to keep me from getting a pet though, but it's not really something appropriate for me to challenge her on so whatever. I brought up the idea of getting a hairless cat once and she shot me down immediately saying they ""freak her out"" due to the way they look. That reasoning is stupid, but I can't afford a spynx anyway so didn't fight her too much on it.

I don't have the time or the money for a dog and my roommate says she is allergic to cats. Sometimes I question if she's actually being honest about this or if she's just saying it to keep me from getting a pet though, but it's not really something appropriate for me to challenge her on so whatever. I brought up the idea of getting a hairless cat once and she shot me down immediately saying they ""freak her out"" due to the way they look.

41,AITA for not saying bye?,"I've (26 very stubborn, social norms contesting male with convincing social skills but actually a loner) been a couple of weeks in my girlfriend's (25) house that she shares with 2 other girls. Overall, things were pretty chill, I was super welcomed, one of them made me a traditional dessert as soon as she heard I had never had it, and on my part I helped around the house cooking, cleaning and doing groceries. There was even talk about me moving in but my gf didn't feel it was right (im ok with it, she's right)

Now, the night before my predawn flight we had a party, and between not really having fun, feeling funny from the gin and having to pack, I silently went to my room prepare myself to sleep.

And then my gf came to check on me and eventually asked if i wasn't even gonna say goodbye to the people in the party, specially those who hosted me, and I said no. I had felt I had made plenty clear that I appreciate their kindness, even paying for one of their groceries trip, and that a salute would be superfluous, plus I wasn't feeling 100% cus of alcohol. In reality, I expressed myself in that all too familiar pedantic way men try to explain why they'r right.

Today my gf tore me a new one for how disrespectful and rude I was, which I don't fully deny but had made very clear I don't believe I had done anything terrible. I asked for their numbers so I could ask forgivess for any disrespectful attitude I might have had, but she denied to share, saying I'm arrogant and self-centered.

42,Update: AITA for leaving my friend at a party because she insulted me?,"Hello everyone, I've received a few requests asking for an update on my situation and I did promise one so here I am.

To begin with, I feel bad for leaving her at the party. I shouldn't have done that, like everyone here said, I should have just offered her a ride, found her another ride, or told her I was leaving. I was so embarrassed and angry that I just didn't want to be around her anymore so I left quietly. Thanks to a kind redditor, I believe I may have some self-esteem and anger issues I need to work out, so I have scheduled a meeting with my campus counselor, and maybe get some professional therapy after that.

Now on Friday afternoon I texted my friend Tina to talk so we can finally clear the air. She agreed and we met at her dorm. I apologized for leaving her at the party and not telling her I was leaving. She said that she is still pretty mad about leaving her in an unsafe situation when she was drunk. I told her I was upset at what I felt was her perceived revulsion. She apologized and said that she shouldn't have made me feel so unattractive. She said that because I'm like her brother, she would never find me attractive, but that doesn't mean other girls don't. I told her that I don't care if she did find me attractive, I was just upset with the tone. She said she understood, after I left one of our friends told her that she kinda went overboard with it and she really regretted how she said it. She apologized again, and I apologized again for leaving her. We admitted that we're not super happy with each other at the moment and are going to take some time apart to sort out our feelings(not romantic) toward each other. If we run into each other we're not gonna be awkward, and we might even text. But no hanging out like we were before.

And that's it. Not a particularly happy update, but I guess it's better than nothing right? Thanks to all the redditors who helped me through this little mini-saga.

43,AITA for telling my coworker’s wife nobody knew about her?,"I’ve (26M) been working at my job for a little over 4 years. During Covid Theo (25ish M) joined our crew. In the 2 years we have known him, he has NEVER mentioned a spouse. He’s talked about friends and family, his favorite things, what he’s cooking for dinner, everything but that and kind of made himself sound single. A couple of coworkers even asked him out but he declined because he doesn’t date coworkers. I can’t deny he’s VERY good looking which attracted a lot of interest from coworkers.

A few weeks ago, I was walking home from grocery shopping near work and my bag split. A woman help pick up everything and even offered her tote. We chatted and it turns out she was Theo’s WIFE. They had been married for 3 years so before he even started this job. When I introduced myself as Theo’s coworker, it was clear Theo had told her about work and us but I don’t think she realized that we didn’t know she even existed.

When I went to work, I casually asked Theo if he was seeing anyone and he shrugged and said work was too busy. I thought it was weird he wouldn’t mention his wife so I messaged her and said we needed to talk.

We met later at a cafe and I told her that no one knew who she was because Theo never mentioned her. I talked about how women would flirt with him. I mentioned he never wore a wedding ring. She started blinking hard as if trying not to cry. She looked crushed. But she was a sweetheart and paid for my coffee before I even got a chance to.

The past few days Theo has been very moody. He started buying lunch instead of bringing one from home. He’s been ignoring me which interferes in our work. He cornered me today after work and told me that his wife was sad and he didn’t know why but it was my fault. He told me to never contact his wife or talk about her again. I told my coworkers what happened and everyone expressed shock that he had a wife. A few coworkers said I was an asshole for telling my coworker’s wife that he hid her existence but most took my side. My boyfriend said I was in the right and people would want to know if their spouse was acting shady like Theo.

Edit: is it not normal to chat with people evenif its strangers? I grew up in a small town and we talked with everybody.

44,AITA : My best friend left me over my jokes but I never saw a problem,"Me, F 18, and my (now ex) best friend, F 19, were best friends for almost 2 years. We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :

“i have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.”

I was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)

I guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me.

45,WIBTA for asking my sister to fully participate in my wedding?,"Hi, All!

She has pets and is struggling to find pet care, stating it's due to the holiday weekend. She said her friends who often watch her pets are out of town and that a lot of the pet sitting services are increasing fees for the holiday. She can't bring her dogs to the wedding bc my dog doesn't get along with dogs. Due to not having pet care, she's taking the train in for the day, but can only stay for a few hours because of the holiday weekend train schedule. 

She is refusing to wear a costume, stating it will be too much to navigate on the train. She likely will not bring a dish, either. I have offered to let her stay in and AirBnB with a group of guests she doesn't know. Her other option would be to get a hotel room or her own AirBnB.

46,AITA for telling my friend that a 50/50 split isn't fair?," Recently, my husband (30M) and I (27F) were having dinner with my friend Kim (27F) and her husband Aiden (28M). Kim and I have known each other since college and are really close. Kim and her husband have been together for over 3 years. They met at work when they were both working as graphic designers. Kim no longer works in graphic design and graduated about a year ago with a masters in a different field.

So at dinner, Aiden brought up a podcast he listened to talking about a girl who signed a car lease for her new boyfriend. This lead to us discussing how we split finances in our own relationships. My husband and I split expenses based on income, we also have joint and separate accounts. My husband makes 10k more than me, so he pays a greater percentage of our expenses. Aiden brought up that he and Kim split expenses 50/50.

I was a little surprised because Kim makes significantly more then he does after her career change. By significant, she has told me she makes 115k which is 45k more than her husband. When I questioned why they split 50/50 instead of proportionally based on income, Kim gave me a nasty look. But I pushed the question a little more and Kim erupted saying that their finances were none of my business. 

I was taken aback because I didn't expect this topic to be a sore spot and Kim and I both talk a lot about demolishing traditional gender roles. I pointed out that it probably wasn't super fair to be splitting 50/50 when you make a lot more than your partner. Now Kim is mad at me and my husband says that I should have just kept quiet to keep the peace.

47,WIBTA for actively trying to prevent my neighbors from parking in front of my home?,"Throwaway, because I just don't want this to be tied to my main. We (f26), me and my boyfriend (m23) have recently moved into a nice home located on a riverside. We have no neighbors in front of us, only to the side and behind. Our neighbors to our right live in a Triplex, three families one roof. A few weeks ago, one of the neighbors friend started to park in front of our house. We didn't know it was them until my BF, who knows one of the girls living in the triplex, asked them if they knew who this unknown large black truck belonged to. I didn't think much of it until the car was parked there every day after. The BF asked them to move their vehicle upon my request. It was becoming an eyesore, and frankly I find it rude that they're parking in front of our home in the first place. 

They moved the large truck, to only be replaced a few days later by two sedans now taking up the entirety of our front. One is even blocking our mailbox now. My BF said due to property easement, I can't even legally make them move. He originally (back with the black truck) told them that they can park in front of our recycling bin off to the side of our property. They would basically be parked half on our side half on theirs under one of the electrical posts. They moved our recycling bin forward, now near the post, and are parking behind it right in front of our doorway with the other behind.

At this point I'm getting mad, and I've even thought about saying, ""fuck it"" and going out to buy a bunch of bushes and plants and planting them on the property line so they can't park there anymore. My BF has already asked them not to park there, but he said that if they're choosing to ignore him it's out of his hands. He also doesn't understand why I'm getting so worked up about it, says I'm being dumb. My biggest issues are 1) I find it incredibly rude to park in front of someone's property & 2) I didn't buy a riverside property to stare at my neighbors cars all day.

48,AITA for waking up my roommate by talking on the phone at night?,"My friend and I rented a room together for our first semester of college. I moved from a different city and we're going to a school in his home city. There was a friend I left behind when I moved out of college who has mental issues and was dependent on me for support. She was distraught that I was moving, but I made a promise to her that I would always be available to talk to any time of the day or night. Because of this I never put my phone on silent.

She calls a lot late at night because of her schedule, that's when she's able to talk. I don't mind so much because I'm a night person and have insomnia. My friend/roommate however has started complaining that it wakes him up and asks if I could put my phone on silent at night. I said no. I go out of my way to talk quietly on the phone, but he says the ringing wakes him up and me talking keeps him awake, sometimes for a long time. I suggested ear plugs or headphones and he seemed pissed.

To make matters worse my friend seems like he's starting to resent me and her for it. She was talking about moving here and I asked my friend if he could ask our apartment complex if we have any open rooms.

I'm a person of my word and don't want to break this promise to her. Frankly I've known her longer and her well being is a priority to me.

I moved from a different city and we're going to a school in his home city. There was a friend I left behind when I moved out of college who has mental issues and was dependent on me for support. She was distraught that I was moving, but I made a promise to her that I would always be available to talk to any time of the day or night. Because of this I never put my phone on silent.

She calls a lot late at night because of her schedule, that's when she's able to talk. I don't mind so much because I'm a night person and have insomnia. My friend/roommate however has started complaining that it wakes him up and asks if I could put my phone on silent at night. I said no. I go out of my way to talk quietly on the phone, but he says the ringing wakes him up and me talking keeps him awake, sometimes for a long time. I suggested ear plugs or headphones and he seemed pissed.

49,AITA for using a “Moe Syzlak” joke about my brother during parents 40th anniversary party? It turned about to true but I had no idea he has really done what joke was about.,"Edit: on mobile( it’s 5:45 am, sorry about typos 


I’m a huge Simpsons fan and in any early episode Moe makes a joke “hi my name is Moe, or as women call me ‘who’s that hiding in the bushes?’”

My parents had their 40th wedding anniversary this weekend and my older sister organized a party and insisted that she, me and my brother give toasts. I wanted no part of it but we always do what she says so I tried to make mine funny.


Roughly what I said was “my parents have 3 kids, Toni or as call her “red card.” I’m the middle child, I don’t get a nickname in fact I don’t think my parents even know my real name and then of course Aiden who all the girls in the neighborhood called ‘who’s that in the bushes?” 

I thought it was funny but amongst the 60 year olds—it was dead silence. But two of their oldest friends got up and started to walk out. My sister tried to gloss over by having a toast. My mom did her toast then went after her friends, my dad followed my mom. They came back five minutes later very upset.

They have a daughter aged between me and my brother. I guess one night when he was 14 he rode his bike 12 miles across town and did what I joked about. Nothing physical happened but I guess it was never fully rectified between my family and theirs and they thought I was making light of something that was traumatic for their family.

I truly did not know as my parents always hid my brothers “escapades” from us.

Sister and parents are furious with me and refuse to believe I didn’t know and made joke on purpose. My brother is back on the road van lifing so we won’t see him for a year or so when all will be forgotten.

50,AITA for telling my husband what I think he should do with a car he inherited from a family member who passed?,"My husband and I are in our late 40s and got married a little before covid. This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. 

On with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). 

Here is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. 

My husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. 

I’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. 

He even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?

51,AITA for not forcing my parents to invite my fiancée to their upcoming christmas party?,"Christmas in my (28m) family is a big deal. My parents’ holiday parties are pretty extravagant and beyond family, only a select few get invites. This includes close friends and neighbors. My siblings and I can make suggestions but it’s our parents’ party at the end of the day, which means their decisions are final. My parents also happen to be notoriously hard to impress.

A few of my friends have made the invite list for the party before, but slowly as I’ve gotten older and lost touch with people, that list has dwindled down to just my longtime best friend and former roommate, Jordan (32m). We grew up in the same neighborhood and he even worked at my dad’s company for the majority of his 20s. While he’s my friend first and foremost, he’s clearly also a friend of the family. My parents love him and have since we met when I was 15 and he was 19. 

I got engaged in September after dating my fiancée (29f) for around a year and a half. She wasn’t put on the guest list last year and she didn’t see it as a problem since she was busy with her own family festivities. I hadn’t really put much thought into what might happen this year besides a brief mention to my parents about adding her sometime last month. 

As always, my parents email my siblings and I the final guest list on November 1st in order for us to look over it and give our thoughts as they finalize final numbers in preparation to send out invitations and RSVPs. As I looked over it this morning, I noticed my fiancée's name wasn’t on there. An important note is that the party isn’t the only Christmas celebration had. I also stay with my family on Christmas night in order to open presents the next morning, and all significant others are invited to that. I told this to my fiancée and she was livid. She said it was beyond disrespectful that Jordan got an invite but she didn’t, and that I needed to stand up to my parents. I told her it was their party, and they had the final say but that Christmas festivities would still happen - this just gave her time with her own family again.

AITA?

ETA: After texting them for a reason she was left out, my mom told me that multiple people had expressed distaste for her in the past and that she was trying to minimize the amount of negativity/drama as much as she could. If I had to guess, I know who these people are - my sister and Jordan - who have both had slightly unpleasant interactions with my fiancée in the past where she claimed they were both stuck up. I now feel even more caught in the middle.

52,AITA for microwaving dinner at friend’s house after work without his knowledge?,"(this is an update post) 

for those who didn’t see the previous post:

For context: there was a storm here last night, my best friend lives with his pregnant fiancé in the next town over, I was given the key to their house in case of an emergency when she got pregnant because he travels a lot for work.

Anyways around 6 or 7PM I was on my way home, more tired then usual after an incredibly long day which I won't go over because It would bore you, but to summon it up I had a massive headache and was really hungry, the only things nearby were a Burger King, McDonalds, etc... I definitely didn't want any of that junk, but it also raining and I had to get food before driving home otherwise I don't feel like I would be able to handle it.

so I figured by best friend who lived nearby would have been ok if I used my key to his house to go inside, microwave myself some dinner, wash whatever dishes I used then left, and so I did, I texted him first but didn't get a reply so I just went, I parked my car in his drivewayx knocked on the door, no response, so I went inside.


he wasn't home and neither was his fiancé, I had my dinner, cleaned the dishes I used then left, I felt so much better afterwards.


Anyways I got a text from him later and both him and his fiancé are absolutely furious at me.

While I was trying to justify myself I didn't even get to start my story, I only said a couple words and interrupted me  by saying there was no excuse, I told him not to interrupt me and he called me impatient,  I told him he was making a big deal out of nothing, and then he actually got upset and started being speaking aggressively to me so I hung up and sent him a message telling him not to worry and that I will pay them back for whoever much the food cost and give him back his keys, no response to my text.

now here’s what happened this morning:

his fiancé called me and she’s demanding I give back their keys and I told her i’ll stop by and do that on my way back home from work later today, she also called me names, funny thing is I was the one who introduced these two... 

I feel like it was an emergency, try driving an hour in the rain after working your ass off all day while having a massive headache and being hungry.

I've thought about trying to take my ex to court for full custody of my daughter, but I feel like my daughter might choose her in the end and it would all be for nothing.

Sometimes my daughter tells me that my ex says hurtful things to her, and that she's not happy living there. But she's never once said she wanted to live with me.

54,AITA for not giving their dog back?,"My husband and I have a five year old beagle. We've been wanting to get a second beagle for a few months now. We found a five month old beagle for sale online. The ad said the owners were moving back to their home country so had to re-home him. We drove three hours to meet him, our current dog and him got along great so we decided to take him home with us.

When we got there, they gave us more info and they were actually only planning to visit their home country for six months as there was a mix up with their Visa. Their son lives with them and will be staying here but he works 12 hour days so they decided it would be best to give up their dog (Leo) as they didn't want him to be alone that much. Which I thought was a bit odd... If it's only going to be six months then put him in daycare or get a dog walker? But whatever, it was their decision.

My husband was involved in an accident that injured his spinal cord so badly he needed to have a wheelchair. He also suffers from a head injury that causes him to be unable to perform some tasks properly as well as constant confusion. Sometiimes he'd lose track of time.


I take care of the house and kids on me own. Yesterday, I wanted to go shopping for some christmas stuff but couldn't take the kids because firstly, they'd want to get everything they see. And secondly, I didn't want them to see what I bought them. I couldn't get the babysitter to come watch the kids like she does usually when I'm out. I was in a rush, what I did was place the kids ( 3&5 )and their toys near my husband and asked him to just keep an eye on them. He was unsure of the whole thing but I had to leave.


During my 2nd hour of shopping I got an angry call ftom his mother berating me for leaving my husband with the kids knowing he's unable to watch them properly. I went home and she yelled at me there saying thank God she came over because she found my husband asleep in his wheelchair and the kids were out of sight. I said I was in a rush, the babysitter didn't come and thought it wouldn't hurt if he watched them for a couple of hours. She argued about how irresponsible I was to leave my husband with the kids knowing he's unable to watch them like any other able bodied person could. She said I should've made sure someone was with the kids and my husband. I had a screaming match with her and my husband just watched. She left and told her family about what a horrible mother I was and even claimed I was abusing my husband by giving him tasks he can not handle. They of course sided with her.

57,AITA for not telling my wife about our son's broken arm?,"Backstory, I(42 M) have been with my wife Janet (40 F) for 16 yrs.  We have one son Jack (11 M). 

Before we started dating, my wife, her mom and sister have dreamed about doing a girls trip together.  They've never pulled the trigger, but they talk about it at least twice a yr.  So for a combined birthday/Christmas gift for everyone I booked and paid for a 7 night cruise for the 3 of them.  Everyone was super excited and I was husband/ inlaw of the year. 

Well.... 2 days into the cruise and my son, being a boy, broke his arm.  We rushed him to the doctor and he's holding up great.  Break wasn't severe and his cast isn't covering his entire arm in the permanent hand raise position. 

Here is where I might be the AH.  I didn't tell my wife when it happened.  My initial thought was to immediately call her, but then I thought it through.  1.  I didn't have an easy way to call. She's on a cruise with no cell service.  I'm sure there is way to contact her, but I didn't have it ready. 2.  There was nothing she could do.  Was she going to cut it short and get a crazy expensive 1 way flight to come home?  I didn't want to worry her.  3.  Our son was fine!  He was upset he had to wait for the swelling to go down to get a cast, bc he wanted everyone to sign it.  4. She was going to be home when the cast went on.

So I didn't tell my wife till I picked her up.  Now everyone is calling me an AH for keeping that information from her.  She is mad at me and giving me the slient trestment.  Somehow by not telling her I also ruined the trip. I just wanted her to enjoy a trip she's been talking about for almost 2 decades.  

Was I wrong?

58,AITA For asking my mom to babysit my son?,"I 22F have a one and a half year old son, i rarely ever ask anyone to babysit him but the times i have it’s never been more than an hour. Recently I’ve been wanting to dye my hair but want it professionally done which I’ve never done, so it comes out the way i want it. i also have been wanting a hair at a salon, i usually cut my own and haven’t been to a salon for a hair cut since middle school. All of this is a little pricey to me and i view as a huge luxury. I was looking up salons around me and appointment times and the only one that seem to work out for me was on Friday which happens to be my birthday. I went back and forth on this for an hour and finally convinced myself that i deserve this. Before i made the appointment i doubled checked with my mom to see if she can watch my son while i go which would be about 3 hours. She response was very unexpected. She reminded me there’s a possibility that her work could call her for over time(she works M-F for three hours a day) and she wasn’t gonna decline for me. Then she remembered she has that Thursday and Friday off giving her a for day weekend, but she looked at me real serious and started saying it was her day off and kept repeating that to me. She then said i need to be scheduling that kind of stuff for the weekend. The salon i was gonna book at has no weekend openings till mid December and i wanted it for my birthday. When i told her that she just looked at me and again said it was her day off and i need to schedule stuff like this for the weekend. She just treated me like i was being totally inconsiderate and like i do this often but i don’t especially not her but i did this time because she’s my only option.

59,AITA My friend won't let me park my car in her driveway for an hour or so for Halloween,"I (35f) asked my friend (35f) if I could park my car in her driveway for an hour or so to go trick or treating on Halloween.

Some background info to this story. We had plans to go together with our kids for trick or treating in her neighborhood because I live on a main road with no sidewalks and most surrounding areas have no sidewalks. I see that as not trick or treat friendly so I try to find a different neighborhood to go to. I asked my brother last year and this year had planned to go with this friend of mine. The week before Halloween, my daughter was sick and my friend's son got something too so we decided not to go together if we even went at all. I also know she's content with missing trick or treating bc her son is in daycare and got to go to parties...my child did not...nothing for Halloween..except looking forward to the actual day.

My daughter got better,  but I came down with strep throat. I went to doctor and got antibiotics and im not contagious but not up to par. 
I asked her if we could park our car in their driveway to go trick or treating. Im going to wear a mask and push a stroller..not going door to door and my husband and toddler were going to go door to door.
Now I didnt ask them to see us, go to their door for treats, nothing but park the car.
Her response was ""I am sorry but I am not comfortable with that."" My response was okay. Although I respect she has a right to answer how she feels, I dont understand what's uncomfortable? All I can think is shes thinking im not being responsible and just thinking along the lines of covid protocol...but as I stated before, im on antibiotics, not contagious, confirmed this with the doctor and also don't want to see or hangout with her and her family. 
Her response made me feel like I did some faux pas. I don't even want to ask because I feel like its so stupid to deny me of a simple request.

60,AITA for being mad and not letting my mom buy me a birthday present,"I (26m) had my birthday about a month ago. Normally my mom throws people big parties on their birthday. She's done it for everyone in the family including my older sister, dad, and herself, except for me. We had a small family dinner that she decided for my birthday. Leading up to my birthday I gave my parents a list of things I would like if they were going to get me a gift. I have lots of interests/hobbies and talk to both of my parents about them all of the time so they know what kind of things I like. Well at my birthday, I didn't get any gifts. I was a little upset ngl, but was like whatever and went and bought myself the things I wanted most the next day. My mom said sorry she didn't get me anything but it was because she didn't know what to get me. I told her that it was OK and that if she still wanted to get me something that tournament grade throwing axes were what I wanted.

Fast forward to this morning and my dad and I were talking about a recent tournament I did and he said I should ask for a set of axes for Christmas. I told him (and my mom who was in the room) that I've been wanting them for a while and asked for them for my birthday. Later that day my mom tells me that she wa sorry she didn't get me the axes and that she didn't hear me and to send her a link for the ones I want. Honestly it just seems too late at this point and I was over being upset about the lack of celebration. 

I don't plan to give her the link or let her buy me anything. I'm just going to buy them for myself. Tbh I think I'm more upset about the lack of effort on her part.

61,AITA for not wanting to go to my boyfriend’s son’s birthday party?,"Me (30f) and my bf (31m) have been together 3 years. I have one son(11) he has one son is is about to turn 8 in a few days. Bf only sees his son every other weekend. 

A month ago, I made the suggestion of going to an animal farm for the son’s birthday. The son is all about it and that’s what he wants to do. A small birthday celebration with presents and cake etc. All good right. 

After being on implant birth control for 7.5 years, my bf and I decided it was time to give my body a break with the hormones. I got my implant removed early. 6 weeks later he got a vasectomy. I got pregnant. We found out when I was 12 weeks pregnant. 

It’s been 8 days exactly that I haven’t had my baby. Even though it wasn’t what we planned for, my heart changed and I was happy. 
Now I’m broken and I’m honestly a big mess. I have panic attacks every time I go anywhere and see anything baby related/ pregnant ladies/ gender reveals/ etc. I have two appointments with psychiatrists but haven’t seen them yet bc I’m a new patient. 

My bf is putting all his attention into his son. Maybe that’s his way of grieving, idk. But it makes me feel like our child together didn’t matter. 

He’s upset with me for not wanting to celebrate his son’s birthday anymore. It would be hard for me celebrating the birth of his child while I’m still struggling.

62,AITA for telling my roommate she can't host so many movie nights in our room?,"Hello, I need advice on if I'm actually in the wrong or not. I (18F) live with my roommate we'll call her Alice (18F), in college. Alice is aro-ace, this will be important. She has a projector and likes to host movie nights in our room when I'm not there. 

Recently I had two shitty nights and every time I've come back there's been 5+ people in my room past 11 pm. Yesterday after they cleared out I asked my roommate to not host so many especially when she is aware I'll be coming back. She said okay and went to join her friends in the hall.

My boyfriend(18M)stayed in my room late that night to comfort me. When my roommate came back she saw us and said ""I don't understand how you asked me to not host so many movie nights when you didn't even ask me if he could stay the night"" to which me and him said he wasn't and we were waiting for her to get back so he could leave.

After he left she said she wanted to talk. She told me, whenever me and him cuddle, dance while we talk (a weird thing we do), or just show PDA to each other it makes her uncomfortable. She said she's not sure if it's due to her being aro-ace. Also saying that she doesn't want him over as often, he's normally over 5-6 times a week. While she either has her friends in our room for similar amounts of time (alittle less) or stands with our door open talking to them, whenever I'm trying to sleep. Also claiming that because they aren't friends it feels like he's a stranger in her room. And that she hoped they would become friends yet she said every time he's here, he's here for me. Which I thought was normal and that they shouldn't be like friends but more acquaintances.

I felt like she kinda attacked me after I brought up movie nights. Like she wanted to get back at me. Though she said she's felt like this previously. I had asked in the past if he made her uncomfortable and she said no. So I'm confused about how to fix her issue or if I should just keep living the way I have been? Or if I'm even in the wrong here.

63,AITA for touching my friend's leg in a way that made them uncomfortable without verbal consent?,"This is a throwaway.

Yesterday I (16M) was spending Halloween with my best friend (16NB). Before going any further, I feel like I need to mention that we are both really close and pretty touchy with each other. For example, they let me play with their hair, and I let them play with my hair too. We have a weird kind of bond where we don't mind saying that we ""love"" each other. But we are not together, we are just really close friends who trust each other a lot.

We went to a halloween party and had our arms around each other. I thought it would be funny if I grabbed their leg and lifted it up to make a funny pose, so I grabbed their leg and tried to lift it up. But they freaked out and screamed really loudly before pushing me away. They seemed really really scared. I expected them to be okay with it, and I didn't think I had to ask to do it. Most of the time when we are touching each other we don't ask each other for consent and we're both totally okay with it.

I apologized a ton, and they said it was okay. They also apologized for freaking out so much. We were both really embarrassed and what was a good time suddenly turned really awkward. They told me they have a problem with people touching their legs, and that it makes them feel really uncomfortable.

64,AITA for not introducing husbands biological daughter to her biological siblings?,"So before my husband and I ever met, he had a brief fling with a woman from work and she ended up pregnant. They decided to give the child up for adoption. A girl. Later on, we meet, get married, and I have three kids that are now 15, 14, and 9. In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship.

In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship.

65,AITA For not being willing to take the kids to early morning band practice?,"So I 34F and my husband 36m are watching our friends two children for a week while they leave the country for a family emergency. I live in a major city and use public transportation but they have agreed to leave us the car for easy travel. This is fantastic since I will be staying at their place and it's not in the city and public transportation is not available in their area.
Here's my delima: they did not tell me that we were watching the kids until 1 week before they leave. My manager just so happens to be out of the office for the same week I'm watching the kids. Because of this,I cannot make adjustments to my schedule. The one child has to be at school at 6am (long before the school busses start running) for an advanced band he's in. I cannot reasonably take him to this practice and get to work on time. WIBTA if I told them he has to miss that week of practice or they have to find him other transportation to school on those days?

Edit for clarity: I feel like I might be the asshole because I am agreeing to take care of these kids while their parents are away but am refusing to take him to an advanced band practice that he work hard to get into.

66,AITA for saying no to my sister-in-law using my husbands sperm to have a baby?,"Obviously a throwaway. 

My (F30s) husband (M30s) and I have been married for five years. We have a wonderful relationship and three amazing dogs. We decided a while ago that we didn’t want to have children. Our dogs are good enough for us. In fact, a few months ago we decided to take the next step and my husband and I decided he would get a vasectomy. We thought it was a good idea because that way we weren’t placing the entire burden on me for our birth control. 

However, yesterday my husband and I were speaking and he casually dropped a weird bomb on me. His sister asked him if he’d be willing to donate his sperm so she could have a baby with someone else’s eggs.

Yeah. Right? 

My sister in law and I have a friendly relationship. She and my husband are very close and I often think they cross a line when it comes to boundaries in our (my husband and my) relationship. My husband is someone who wants to please others, often helping neighbors and serving our community. 

On the other hand, I understand why his sister would ask him for this favor, they are really close. Furthermore, my sister in law is unmarried and has been having fertility issues. But to me, once my husband and I made a decision, together, that was final. There’s no guilting me into changing my mind. I don’t want little versions of my husband walking around several years from now hanging around during Christmas and Thanksgiving. I cringe when I think about what that experience could bring, especially when I don’t want to be part of this.

My husbands response? My body, my choice. I unequivocally said, “No fucking way,” and ended the conversation there. My husband said he wants to think about it some more because it’s something his sister really wants. I’ve made it clear that this is a non-negotiable in our relationship. AITA?

69,AITA for refusing to borrow my wedding (made by my mum) dress to my sister?," EDIT: someone told me that should be ""lend"" not borrow, Sorry for my mistake.

I (32F) got married 7 years ago. 

My mom made my wedding dress and she also did the same for my older sister at her wedding 9 years ago. 

Sadly, my mother passed away 3 years ago from cancer. 

My younger sister Jess (27F) is currently engaged and her wedding will be in 1 year. 

We recently met for coffee and she commented that she always wanted our mother to make her dress, but at the time she wasn't even with her current fiancé and now she can't anymore. 

After a little chat, she asked if I still had my wedding dress, as shevwould like to wear it too, as it is something my mother made.

 I was a little disconcerted and asked if it could be our sister's dress (she already borrow it to someone else), as I was very attached to the wedding dress. She said she didn't want hers, because it wasn't white (pastel pink) and my body and hers were more similar. 

I said I didn't want to, because even though we have similar bodies, it would need adjustment in the breasts and hips area. I don't want to ""modify"" the dress. But that I could borrow her the veil so she can have something from our mother. 


She started complaining, saying that it wouldn't hurt me to borrow the dress, the adjustments would be minimal, she was the only one of the sisters who can't have something done by our mom and she basically has to turn to me to get something of hers. She practically begged me to borrow the dress. 

I feel bad for her, but I really don''t want to modify something in the dress, because it's a memory of my mom and one of the best days of my life, it was just for me. In the face of all this, I don't feel comfortable borrowing the dress, but that I could make the concession of the veil. 

She walked away crying after I stood by my decision, saying that I was being selfish not to allow her to have any feeling close to having something done for our mother and not being able to share something so special with her too, when she never will have something close to that.

 People are calling me an AH (our father, fiancé and in-laws - except my older sister who didn't chose ""sides"")

71,AITA defending my husband after a prank went horribly wrong,"My husband, Jayden (26), loves jokes and pranks and stuff. I'll admit I'm not one for them, and find most of them dumb, but our daughter Lucy (5) loves them. They basically do a bunch of stupid pranks to each other, and to be fair Jayden does keep it harmless. Last month we got some realistic looking spider toys with other decorations. Since we got them, Jayden and Lucy have basically taken turns putting them around the house to scare each other or me. I honestly find it annoying but the two of them love it. Lucy does usually get scared, but when she realises what it is she laughs and finds it funny or tells her dad off (it's actually adorable when she tells him off though), and Jayden always pretends he is scared even when she gives it away beforehand by giggling and watching him. 

So about two weeks ago Jayden set it to fall on her when she opened her toybox in the playroom. Lucy didn't open it and apparently he forgot it. Later that week we had my family over including my brother Leon, and my nieces (Tara 3 and Zoe 6) over. Zoe was badly bitten by a spider when she was younger, even had to go to the hospital. Since then she is deathly afraid of them, I would go as far as to call it a phobia. 

The kids went to play and the spiders fell on them. Zoe completely freaked out and just melted down. We came down and saw what happened. Jayden did apologise and try to cheer her up, but Leon was furious. He basically accused us of doing it on purpose, that we should know better and just calling us assholes. We did apologise and explained that it wasn't meant for Zoe, but my brother did not listen to him at all. Leon left early with my SIL and nieces, and the whole night was kind of ruined.

I've tried to talk.to him after, but Leon is still pretty pissed with us. It's been a week and he's still acting like we tried to murder Zoe. I've tried explaining again that it was an accident and mistake. But he basically thinks it's too convenient a mistake, and that if it is Jayden is still an asshole for being so immature and I'm an asshole for defending him. 

So now he basically refuses to see us unless Jayden is banned, which is ridiculous.  I do feel bad that it went so wrong and I understand that it was horrible mistake. But it wasn't meant to happen.

72,AITA for telling my husband to get over himself?,"My husband has a 14 year old daughter, Everly, from a previous relationship. Her bio mom is not in the picture and he and Everly are very close as a result of that. Everly has some serious health issues. I won't say what they are out of respect for her privacy but she's in and out of the hospital and is being monitored almost 24/7 at home. 

Everly was just in the hospital and came home yesterday. When my husband took her home, he got distracted with a work call and I was with our 3 month old so my mom got her something to eat and tucked her in for a nap. When my husband was done with his call he went into Everly's room to check on her. She was supposed to be asleep so he didn't knock because he didn't want to wake her up. When he went in Everly dove under the covers and told him to get me or my mom. He got me and I checked on her and gave her meds.

73,AITA for doing a mother-son dance with my stepmom at my wedding?,"Im (29M) currently planning a wedding and were getting into the nitty gritty details. For background my parents got divorced when I was 5. The divorce happened after my dad fell in love with his current wife/my stepmom Alice. They claim they didn't cheat but waited to be separated before anything physical happened. I dont know or need to know whether thats true at this point. My dad and Alice got married and were living together by the time I was 7. They had my two siblings within the next 4 years. My parents had split custody and Alice was 100% a mother figure to me.

My mom is a good mom but we've never been as close as I am with my dad and Alice. Our personalities are just very different.

We're planning the first dances right now and have my first dance with my fiancee and she has hers picked out with her dad. Her parents are still married so there's no drama there. Being so close to Alice, I really dont feel right excluding her and only doing a dance with my mom, so I asked her if she'd be comfortable doing one with me as well. She was overjoyed and cried with emotion. Im really excited for it. But once my mom found out she flipped out. Said Im replacing her like my dad replaced her.

74,AITA for refusing to compromise and take colder showers?,"My wife and I  have a very busy schedule, both of us work and run on very limited sleep since we have a 6 month old (she’s already planning the next one…wish I was joking!)

Part of my routine is a 15-20 minute shower of a morning and then a 5-10 shower of a night.

Me and my wife haven’t had much time to spend together, but I’m working towards a promotion and we spend all our free time with our baby, so she’s come up with the idea that we should share showers.

Problem being I take my showers as hot as they can go, it’s not hot enough until my skin turns red and my skins still warm from the shower like an hour later…(exaggerating, but yes hot as possible)

My wife likes colder showers, I can’t tolerate colder showers - it honestly stresses me out.

Anyway she’s insisting that I compromise, started “cutely” turning the shower down, but then I started locking the door and now she’s genuinely upset that I won’t compromise and spend my morning with her when it’s the only time we get

She says it’s our relaxing time, that it’s a slight compromise so we can spend time together and I’m refusing to budge despite her wanting to relax with me before staying home all alone with the baby (she works from home, once I get home from work though I take over baby care)

I told her no, she cited the fact that I only like hot showers because as a child I was bathed in scalding water, she knows my childhood is a topic I don’t like, so now we’re both upset with each other.

75,AITA for not allowing my daughter's half sister to spend christmas with us?,"



My ex husband and I got divorced 7 years ago. We share custody of our 13 year old daughter. He got married and has a 5 year old daughter with his now wife.


His daughter would spend time with my daughter regularly. They adore each other but she doesn't come to my house and they rarely meet up there.


His wife has been diagnosed with cancer and has started treatment recently. The other day he came to drop our daughter off and asked to speak to me. He talked about his wife's circumstances then how his family won't be able to have a christmas celebration this year. He said it wasn't fair for his daughter and asked if I could ""include"" her in my family's celebration. He pointed out how the girls will have a great time together bonding and making memories, but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. Plus it'd be awkward having her in my home. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and ""think"" about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents (he said his parents and him are NC) and tried to cut the conversation short but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feeling comfortable having this conversation. I asked him to leave and he did but still texted me asking me to agree to let his daughter come spend christmas even offered that he stays away if that'll make me less uncomfortable, I said no and now he's calling me selfish and unfeeling.

76,AITA for voicing unhappiness about my brother getting half of the inheritance?,"My older brother and I never really had any sort of relationship. He had his own life when he was pretty young. He married young and our family (parents and I) barely kept in contact with him. There were no disagreements, fights etc. He didn't cut us off, but never made any attempts to keep in contact and always rejected any invitations for family meals etc. He only hinted a few times that his wife didn't like our family too much. The only time we saw his kid in person was out at a shopping mall by chance.

&#x200B;

So over the past few years, my mum's health has worsened, requiring surgery and extra care. I got my folks to move in myself and my wife as it would be easier on them, along with getting professional care services in the daytime. I've always updated my brother from time to time about the situation but he has never visited in person and has only sent the odd fruit basket here and there.

  
Recently, I shared with my parents that we were looking to sell our current house to finance an upgrade to a bigger house in a better area. My dad stopped me and said there was no need to as they were able to finance that as they were selling off some properties they had (my parents were not wealthy. They were middle class folks who bought some properties while they were dirt cheap). My parents spoke abit about their plans and said that my brother would be receiving half too.  


I honestly got pissed off and questioned their decision given his utter lack of existence in the past 20 years. My parents said that at the end of the day, he is still their son and it is only fair to do so. I said that by giving him half, I'm put at a disadvantage to him given what I had done over the past few years. I told them that I didn't care about about his half of the inheritance and asked them to consider donating his half away.   


I found it extremely insulting to be at the end of the day, valued the same as my brother. One could say value goes beyond monetary items but I feel that action speaks louder than words.

77,AITA for laughing at my husband's discomfort after he got mad at me for buying the wrong peppers.,"Dear AITA I never thought it would happen to me but I just got called an asshole by my husband so I am bringing it to you to judge.  

I do all the grocery shopping for my house.  My husband and I share all our finances and chores but he works long hours and so I take on the groceries because I like comparing prices and budgeting.  My husband likes to cook and will sometimes request certain things so he can make a special meal he wants.  

He wanted to make Thai chili lime shrimp. He asked me to pick up the hot chilies like you get at a Thai restaurant.  The grocery store didn't have any of those little ones but they did have the ones labeled as hot Thai chilies that were bright red but about the size of a jalapeno. 

He got really upset that I hadn't bought the right ones and that his meal wasn't going to turn out well.  I know he had a tough day so I said I would make sure I got the proper ones the next time I saw them. It was just a silly disagreement with no bitterness or anything. Just a little disappointment on his part.  

He still made the meal.  Including chopping up the chilies.  

After he was done prepping he needed to use the bathroom.  And he scratched his balls.  

Well let me tell you. The peppers had plenty of heat to them after all.  He is sitting on the edge of the tub with the hand held shower blasting cold water at his scrotum.  And every time he tries to stop he has to sit right back down and shoot more cold water at them. 

So I giggled. And he heard me. And then he called me an asshole for laughing at him. 

He also laughed at himself and apologized for saying I got the wrong chilies. Then he called me all sorts of names but I think he is just venting about his balls.

I also knew my wife would struggle when she finally did pass so I tried to convince her to go to therapy but she’s refused.

We have two older children (13 and 6) and this year, she gave birth to our youngest. This is the only grandchild my MIL never got to meet. The whole pregnancy was very bittersweet and my wife kept saying “I wish mom was here, I wish mom could meet him, etc”. Again, to be expected.

I told her that i was hallucinating bugs in my bedroom in the last couple of days and that i would jerk up from my sleep in the middle of the night.  She told me that ”it seemed serious & i should get checked up before it escalates”.

I ignored it and told her to just forget about it. We talked about things that have been on our minds as of recently. We were having a wholesome time preparing this dinner party for our friends and family.

Skip to when the dinner party begins, we greet everyone, do our usual conversing and after an hour, we all sit to eat. After we all talk about recent thoughts and affairs, my sister announces that “i’m going crazy” jokingly whilst she was wine drunk. My mother asked her what she meant and i made signals to her to stop speaking. She progressed and said “Rebecca is seeing things that aren’t there and she can’t sleep without jumping out of her sleep” and laughs it off.

I leave my seat after everyone stares at me, completely embarrassed and i can hear from the hallway that my sister is talking about how i always take everything seriously and that i need to loosen up. I go back in and tell her to “get out of my house or i‘ll escort you out”. She, of course, thought i was kidding. I grabbed her arm and she willingly walked with me until i was at the door and i told her to leave. She again informed me that she didn’t know i wouldn’t want others to know.

It was completely awkward for the rest of the party and i avoided my mother. The next day, my mother EMAILS me a psychiatrist’s information.

80,AITA If I name my daughter the same as her cousin..,"For about 2 years my partner and I have picked out a name for each gender, we had our boy a year ago and are currently pregnant again. We have always called our future children by the names we chose, even before we were pregnant we would refer to our future baby as either Olivia or another boys name we have picked.

My sister in law was pregnant at the same time but much further along. Mid-way through her pregnancy she was discussing a list of potential names and Olivia popped up. We had always kept it secret so my partner reached out and let her know that’s the name we have picked for our child if it’s a girl, and if not this pregnancy we intend on another and if they are a girl it would be Olivia then.

My sister in law was pregnant at the same time but much further along. Mid-way through her pregnancy she was discussing a list of potential names and Olivia popped up. We had always kept it secret so my partner reached out and let her know that’s the name we have picked for our child if it’s a girl, and if not this pregnancy we intend on another and if they are a girl it would be Olivia then.

81,WIBTA My Wife wants more time for herself when all she has to do is take care of our Child.,"Me(27M) and my wife(25f) have a 6 month old child. Before we had the child we agreed that she would be primarily in charge of childcare, while I would do practically everything else. This includes 95% of chores and other housework, I am the only one between the two of us that works a job(Night Shift Security Guard), I make dinner for the family, etc.   


I want to clarify some things before I get INFO'd in the comments. When I say I do 95% of the chores, I mean that my wife will do some of the dishes like the babies bottles or cups when they need to be washed and I am asleep during the day, and occasionally fold a load of laundry that she needed a piece of clothing from before I can get around to it. I vacuum and mop the floors, do the laundry, the dishes, clean the bathrooms, cook dinner and do the grocery shopping. She takes our child to doctors appointments, wakes up with them during the night(on the days I am at work), watches them during the day, and will make baby specific meals(She will puree vegetables and fruit, and cut up smaller portions of chicken).   


I do spend as much time as I can with our child. I wake them up in the mornings when I come home from work and feed them breakfast before I sleep. When I wake up I'll try to play with them for about 30 minutes, doing reading and playing with whatever toy they're interested in for the week. During the weekends when I am awake during the night I will be the one who gets up with our child.  


This is coming to a head because as we were eating dinner before I went to work, she asked if there was any way that I could watch our child more due to her feeling like she needs time for herself. At first I thought that she wanted to have more weekend events with her friends while I watch our child during the day, something I am more than okay with and have agreed with multiple times. Instead she was asking that I sleep less during the days that I work so that she can have breaks from the child during the day. I told her that I would think about it at work and I want to say no. I understand that being a SAHM is stressful because you always have to watch the baby, but she doesn't do any chores and from the way things were phrased she wouldn't be willing to take up any chores during the new break I would be giving her. I don't have much time to myself either, but I do understand that she carries the stresses of watching our child most of the time while I don't.

82,AITA for telling my wife I don't think she should be a SAHM?,"I (M30s) live with my wife (F30s) and our two kids (M7 and F3).

My wife and I both have full-time jobs. Our eldest is in public school 5 days a week and our youngest is in daycare 3 days a week. My wife and I work around each other's schedules. When it comes to housework, I do all the cleaning and laundry as my wife really hates those tasks, and I also do all the cooking. My wife does the grocery shopping.

My job recently offered me a promotion. If I accepted it, I would have a significant increase in pay. The issue is that my job would become a lot more stressful, and I'd have to work more hours. This wouldn't be doable with our current household setup.

I talked to my wife about it and she suggested that she quit her job and become a SAHM. She seemed really eager. 

The issue is that I really don't think my wife is cut out to be a SAHM and I think she would hate it after a few weeks. She hates cleaning, she hates cooking, and she loves her current job. I also think my wife has an idealistic view of being a SAHM. She keeps telling me about how easy her life will be and how she'll be so productive.

I asked my wife if she would really enjoy it, considering that she'd have to do more housework than she currently does. She insists that she wouldn't mind.

My wife got really mad at me and accused me of calling her incompetent. I told her that's not what I meant and that I just don't think being a SAHM is right for her.

83,AITA for refusing to let my daughter invite her bio dad to her birthday and threatening to cancel it?,"
I'm a mother of a 16 (soon 17) daughter ""Kelly"". Her bio dad left when she was 4. It's complicated but despite him being away he still sent money or had his family help from time to time. I still struggled a lot raising her til I met my now husband ""Christopher"". Christopher is like a dad to Kelly. He's the only father figure she had.


However, I found out that she's reconnected with her bio dad through his family (his mother) which I wasn't happy about but I didn't make a fuss about it. Then she started mentioning him often, going to visit him while canceling plans to hang out with us etc. Her justification is that her dad is sick and might be (I say might because she's a child and may not know what it meant) terminal. She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.


Christopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.


Later whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room. She's saying she won't forgive me if I let her dad miss what coukd be her last birthday with him.

84,AITA for refusing to go to my wife's deceased husband's family's house for Thanksgiving?,"My (36m) wife (33f) lost her first husband several years ago from a brain anyeurism. They had two boys together (7 and 6) and I have made my peace with the fact that she will always love him. She even has a sort of shrine to him in our home and I would never ask her to remove it.

We got married only a couple of years ago and last Thanksgiving she asked me to come with her to Thanksgiving at her former in-laws house. Apparently she's gone to their house for Thanksgiving since her first husband died. I support this as it's a way for her to stay connected to her first husband's family and also since it's a way for her two kids to maintain a relationship with their father's side of the family.

So, I went last year. It was a little uncomfortable, but her late husband's family treated me really well. They were very kind and welcoming to me. It wasn't a bad Thanksgiving, but it was still really awkward and I felt very out of place.

This year my wife is trying to get me to go back, but I just want to go have Thanksgiving with my own family. I've invited her along but also told her that I understand if she doesn't want to go, but that we should be moving forward. But if she doesn't want to fine, but that she shouldn't try to make me go to Thanksgiving at her late husband's family's home. She's responded that we can have Christmas, Easter, the Fourth of July, etc with either her family or my family but that she's pledged Thanksgiving to her late husband's family and that I should come with her as her husband to support her.

85,AITA for saying my boyfriend’s roommate can’t come to Thanksgiving Dinner?,"Me (26F) and my boyfriend (34M) have been dating for nearly a year and a half now. Tomorrow, he’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner at my dad’s house and meeting my family for the first time. I’m extremely family oriented and it’s so important to me that he’s finally meeting them. This also means the world to my family because I rarely bring men home and they’ve been wanting to meet him for a long time. He’s aware of this and how much this meeting means to me and has assured me that he’s looking forward to it too. 

This afternoon, he asked if his roommate could come too. I was caught off guard and said no. I didn’t even ask my family who I’m sure would say yes, but it’s a hard boundary for me. I barely know his roommate but he’s military and will not be able to be with his own family for the holiday, which is why my boyfriend asked. I understand and appreciate his compassion and kindness but I need this event to be just him, me, and my family without his buddy who is a stranger to me. I called him to talk through it, but he’s extremely upset and wasn’t really responding. I asked if he’s still coming and he said yes. Then, I asked if he’s okay and he said no but that he will be. I told him to reach out to me when he’s ready and that I understand if he doesn’t want to talk to me right now so I haven’t heard from him since the phone call a couple hours ago. I feel like a massive asshole but this is one of the rare events where I’ve put my foot down in this relationship and refused to accommodate his wants. So, AITA?

Updates:

For more clarity and because people are making a lot of unfounded assumptions, I have briefly met his roommate (ie “hi, bye”) on multiple occasions. We barely know each other, though, because he has a schedule that makes it so he’s rarely around when I am and we’ve never had the opportunity to have a full conversation surpassing basic greetings. I made it very clear that I’d love to have him and include him in my family but the first meeting between my parents and boyfriend wasn’t the place to do so.

My boyfriend has not met my family because I’m very particular about who I bring home and will not bring someone home unless I am 100% comfortable that that is the correct choice. I’m protective of my family and don’t want them to get attached. I get it’s unconventional but it’s my choice and every party involved respects that.

I ended up apologizing to my boyfriend, asking my parents, and inviting his roommate (who wasn’t aware my bf had asked about him coming). He can’t even come anyways.

87,"AITA for refusing to participate in my bf's family's ""tradition'.","I went to Thanksgiving at my bfs family's house last night.  I had met his parents and sister a couple times but this was my first time meeting his more extended family. He said they make a whole day of it, so we would be heading over around 10am.

When we arrived there were several men sitting in the livingroom watching football.  My bf introduced me to his brother, BIL, uncles and some cousins. His dad was was also there. 

There is a cooler in the middle of the room and my bf grabs a beer and sits down to watch the game. 

His mom and sister come in to say ""hi"" and his mom says ""perfect timing! We are just getting going in the kitchen! Come on let's get you a drink!""

I go into the kitchen and there are several women in there. They have Christmas movies on the TV and most of them are doing some kind of food prep. 

I grab my drink and go back and sit with my bf. 

I tried to strike up some conversation, but the guys were super into the game. 

After a while I take my bf to the side and tell him I feel awkward, since I'm not into football, and no one is really talking to me. 

He told me ""then go hang out in the kitchen, the girls talk up a storm. The family tradition is for the guys to watch football and the ladies hang out in the kitchen and make the meal.""

I told him I found that extremely misogynistic, and I was not interested in ""going to the kitchen"" while the men sat around drinking and watching TV.

I ended up just sitting around awkwardly watching them all talk sports until basically dinner was served, at which point  they got up, got a plate and went back to watching tv. 

I told my bf after that I was upset and he said I was over reacting. I told him it was awkward, as I didn't like sports but I didn't want to be banished to the kitchen with ""the women"".

I ended up just sitting around awkwardly watching them all talk sports until basically dinner was served, at which point  they got up, got a plate and went back to watching tv. 

I told my bf after that I was upset and he said I was over reacting. I told him it was awkward, as I didn't like sports but I didn't want to be banished to the kitchen with ""the women"". I told him I didn't really feel like I got to know next to nothing about his family, except that they have this messed up ""tradition"".

88,AITA asking my wife to pay for my daughter's birthday,"My wife (Maddi) have been together for 5 years. I have a daughter, Rachel (14) and son, Mitch (11) from my previous relationship and a stepdaughter Talia (14). We always have had separate finances and originally had similar paying jobs. While hers has definitely become better than mine, we have stayed as we are, aside from shared expenses being split more equally.

Around 7 months ago we found out Rachel is sick. I've been doing everything I can for her, trying to help her and the best treatment I can afford. But the issue is I can't. I'm draining my savings and can barely afford more basic treatment. I can pay for necessities and treatment, but nothing else. Maddi has been financially fine throughout. She's paying more of the necessities, but she's constantly buying Talia things, taking her out, letting her do things that I can't do for either of my children. I know we agreed to have separate finances, and it's not wrong per se. But its definitely been causing some confict, though I've tried hard to work it out. I know that it's my responsibility, but it's just not working well. I can't afford extracurriculars or for them to go out with friends or special dinners or anything. 

Rachel's birthday is coming up, and I want to do something nice while we can. I asked Maddi for help, if she can cover her birthday because I can't. But Maddi refused. She is paying almost all the essentials, and doesn't think she should have to pay for this. That she knows I can't pay her back and it's my responsibility. 

I understand all that, but it's not fair. I'm not asking for my own sake. Rachel and Mitch are already missing out on so much, and I know how horrible Rachel feels. I just want this one good special night for her.

EDIT

A few people didn't understand. Rachel is terminal. This is likely her last birthday which is why I want it to be a real one.

Also I was told to add this: Maddi currently earns 2.5X as much as me (doesn't have medical expenses obviously) and pays 80% of the necessities

Ignore the 1-2k. It's not accurate. My budgeting method makes more sense in practise since having more money saved than needed is never bad. But clearly it doesn't work here.

90,WIBTA if I tell my friend not to send me a Christmas Card from her baby?,"I am a happily child free adult. Babies have always made me super uncomfortable. I don’t like looking at them, being in their presence, or really hearing about them. I used to have panic attacks if I had to be near a baby or toddler, even for a minute or two. If a baby or toddler touched me, I’d freak out and have to go wash off a few layers of skin. I don’t know what caused such an intense reaction, but it’s always been like this. I’ve been working on at least being more cordial and tolerant with babies and toddlers to the point that I no longer have panic attacks. However, they still make me very uncomfortable and I don’t want anything to do with them.

I have a friend (we’ll call her Sally) who knows that I do not like babies and how uncomfortable they make me. Sally had a baby several months back. I was polite and congratulated her. Ever since, every so often, she’ll randomly message me about her baby. She’ll start with “I know you don’t like babies, but…” and then send pictures of her baby, tell me about toys or clothes she bought for her baby, etc. I usually reply in brief messages like “Nice” or “Ok” and leave it at that. I don’t want to be mean, so I just give the minimal response. I delete photo’s immediately (usually our conversations too) cause I’m not interested. Sally and I are not, nor have we ever been, close friends. 

Recently, Sally posted in a group chat we’re both in asking for people’s addresses if they want to receive a Christmas card from her baby (that’s how she worded it). I figured if I didn’t fill out the document that would be an easy non confrontational way to ensure I would not be receiving baby pictures in the mail. Unfortunately, Sally messaged me privately today asking for my address so she could send a Christmas Card; so my silent opt out is no longer an option.

91,AITA? My only sister isn’t making me maid of honour…,"Hi guys.

So my sister and I have always had a very strong bond, we grew up 2 years apart with a turbulent childhood. We formed a strong bond which helped us through a poor/barely existent relationship with our mother. We have no siblings or cousins in the country or anything of the like. 

She has recently been engaged, which I could not be more happy about. I always looked forward to it. 

My problem - we were having dinner the other night where her fiancé mentioned he wasn’t choosing a certain friend as best man because said friend and his brother were each others best men. Upon this comment I looked at my sister and raised my eyebrows (she knew I was asking, were somewhat telepathic lol). She simply responded with “you’re all the same, you and the girls are all the same”. 

Long story short she’s not having a maid of honour because she thinks it’s not fair on her best friends. After all we’ve been through, especially growing up it’s always been US two against the world, she was ALWAYS the only option for me. I have best friends but she is my sister and we’ve experienced the REAL ish together. (To this day she still calls me “bestie sister” in our native language and we are very much friends, I’m not just expecting stuff bc of our childhood). 

Now she’s added me to a group chat with all the bridesmaids. Still hasn’t actually spoken to me about it. 

Part of me just feels to leave the group and maybe then she’ll realise she’s just treating me like any next person without so much the respect of a heads up/explanation. She feebly explained AT dinner that it’s because it’s not fair on her best friends to make me maid of honour. Which makes me more mad because I’m not your FRIEND I’m your ONLY SISTER EVER. but that’s why I don’t think there’s much point talking to her, her mind is clearly made.

92,AITA for telling my kids mom to get over it and accept that our kids are comfortable around my fiancé?,"I (36M) have two kids with my ex-wife, ""Sarah""(35F), a (9M) and (12F).  My ex and I have always done our best to be good co-parents for our kids.  We are, what I call, ""professional friendly"", and never really have a problem switching up the custody schedule to accommodate each other.  We have 50/50 custody.  I have been with my fiancé ""Emily"" (37F) for a few years now.  My kids adore her, and she absolutely loves them.  Sarah and Emily get along pretty well, there has never really been any tension or anything when they are around each other.

Emily and I were throwing a get together for people, which included some of my family.  Since Sarah still gets along quite well with my family, we invited her so she could see them.  At one point, Emily was across the room from me, and I saw my daughter go up to her and whisper something in her ear.  Emily just nodded and led my daughter out of the room.  They came back later and that was that.  After the party, privately, Emily told me that my daughter had gotten her period for the first time right then.  Of course, Sarah and I had already explained everything to her about all of that, so she wasn't freaked out or anything, but she had just asked Emily to come help her take care of everything since it was her first time.

Well, when my ex wife heard about it she was pissed off.  She was so offended that our daughter had gone to Emily instead of her.  Emily told me (privately) that my daughter said that she went to Emily instead of her mom because she knew that Emily would keep it private and not draw everyone's attention at the party.

Me on the other hand, I'm burnt out and all I'm thinking about for an outing is how I will be carrying the stroller across the long metro stairs, the baby needing a diaper change and us running to the nearest toilet, the heavy traffic, the loud noises, in short I see it as stress and a chore, not something I'd do out of enjoyment.

For several days in a row now, I've been holed up in my room and refusing to go out with her while she goes alone. Today, she told me we will just go to the nearest park and that it's unhealthy for me to stay cooped up in the house all the time.

She said why I was even over if all I wanted to do was to stay home, that she was depressed and I'm making her feel worse.

My sister was cured of cancer at 15 and things are back to ""normal"". 

My parents, always absent in my life for everything (not just school), interfered with our relationship.

It's ok, they were focused on my sister and I get it, but yeah, I created a life independent of them. 

My parents even tried to get closer and we have a closer relationship, but it was never really the same. I don't have a close relationship with my sister because we don't get along so well. But even so, they never expressed an explicit interest in what I do.

I just replied that I didn't think they would mind honestly. They started complaining, but I said I had to work. 

Later, my sister texted me saying that I broke our parents' hearts by saying that and that I was really punishing them for something in the past that they couldn't help themselves. 

My parents are distant from me and my sister is still calling me an asshole.

It is: My husband and I with our 2 kids, his sister and husband with their 3 kids, his younger brother and his daughter, his mom and dad, grandma, usually an aunt and uncle and maybe a cousin or 2. Not to mention his brother in-laws parents and maybe a sibling come too. 

I really don’t want to sound like I’m this type of person because I don’t judge anybody on their house size or their wealth, but the issue is that his sisters house is so fucking tiny it’s uncomfortable for everyone there. It actually isn’t even an individual house but it is half of a duplex type. There will be about 20 people coming this year and I just think it’s ridiculous for her to insist on hosting. They also have a large Great Dane that is on top of everyone, well actually everyone is on top of everyone. I shit you not that half of the guests have to sit on the living room floor to eat. Usually the older relatives sit at the 4 person dining table, a few people sit on the couch, and the rest of us are standing or sitting on the floor with our plates of food. OH, and the last big kicker is that there is only ONE bathroom that constantly smells like shit. 

My kids always complain about going to this aunts house because of the reasons I listed. I am siding with them and I said I would talk to dad about us volunteering to host. We don’t live in a mansion but we can comfortably fit all the guests and we have more than 1 bathroom. 

Husband doesn’t want to because he says it will hurt his sisters feelings and she already knows how poor they are and this would be rubbing it in her face. I don’t think that should be the case, I think she should want the family to be comfortable. I’m sure she must know we don’t love sitting on the floor in that cramped house. I’m not sure if I sound like a spoiled bitch asshole right now or if I’m right.",NAH,"Judgement: NAH, Title: AITA for pushing my husband to insist we host Christmas again over his sister?","My husband is one of 3 siblings and they usually rotate who hosts Christmas.

96,"AITA for paying my girlfriend money for a ""survival pack"" she kinda arranged for me when I'm going out to sea for work?","So, I [24M] work as a marine engineer and make a lot of money overseas. Out of curiousity, my girlfriend [24F] asked me what kind of stuff I usually take with myself aboard the ship, so I listed out the stuff like a bunch of men's hygiene stuff, some of my favorite snacks, a bunch of socks, some waterproof winter gear, stomach medicine, etc.


She went ahead and bought a bunch of that stuff for me yesterday and had it delivered to my place along with a note. I was honestly quite taken aback. It had quite a few expensive items, like a razor of high quality, some expensive shampoo, expensive winter gear and stuff, etc. Normally I would've just appreciated the gesture and thought of something I would gift her in a while or so but since I was leaving in a week I was out of ideas and I couldn't have matched the amount she spent on me (in such a short while) meaningfully so I took her out to dinner, thanked her for all that (I actually needed to buy quite a bit of that stuff) and then proceeded to wire her the bill amount next day.


Her reaction... wasn't great, she was disappointed and said that it was a gift which shouldn't be paid back and stuff like that. I felt quite bad but absolutely refused her from paying any of that money back. Normally I wouldn't have paid this but it was quite an amount and I make a lot more money than her, so I felt awkward and was out of ideas. 


We're over it now though but she's asked me to never do something like this again, and I've reluctantly agreed. I also kind of wanted to bring up the cost she put into the gift, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings at all. I'm not going to be able to talk to her for a month now and I'm feeling bad that I fucked up this badly. I have the next 4 days before we don't see each other for 3 months. 


So well, AITA for paying her back money for an expensive gift, which I needed?


EDIT: Well, I have managed to get my point about insecurity about my job through to her and now we're past the point of remembering it even happened. I also told her I'll remember her always when using the gear and everything she sent me, and a bunch of other sappy stuff.

97,AITA for not letting my wife take our kids to see her family over the holidays?,"I (35f) am going to be on call over the holidays, and I agreed to do so months ago since I don't really celebrate christmas. I consulted my wife (32f) before taking this on and while she didn't love it, she agreed.

Her family, who have been absent from her life for the past 10 years since she decided to marry a woman, have contacted her through her cousin to invite us over for the holidays. I have never met them. The invite came through her mother. Her father has been diagnosed with lung cancer, and currently is in a very bad shape since he had a stroke recently. 

My wife is rather keen to take this opportunity to see her family and father in what they've told her is the final weeks of his life. She really wanted me to accompany her but I'm a neurologist and I'm going to be on call a lot so there's no way I can do that.

She wants to take our kids (6M and 5F) with her so they can meet her parents and reconcile over this whole issue. I'm concerned the environment around her parents' house is the same toxic one that she described before and can potentially hurt our kids so I told her while I respect her wishes to see her father, I don't think kids should be there. At least not right now. Maybe after she had a chance to see them and determine if they're accepting enough of our family to bring our kids into the picture.

She got pretty mad, teary eyed and said I am being unnecessarily pessimistic about this and that they wouldn't even invite her if they wanted to behave like before and that I should have some faith and stop acting like this. She said she expected me to be there with her but I'm suffocating myself with my job.

She currently has set her mind that she and the kids are leaving together. I'm trying to at least talk to her and be by her side at this difficult time. She's basically too mad at me and won't talk to me which is a very rare occurrence in our marriage.

98,AITA For Trying to Stop My Job From Having a Dog Friendly Office,"Throwaway.  

I've (F35) been at my job for about a year and a half.  I like my job and had no plans of leaving. During this time we were not a dog friendly office.  My company owns the building we work in.  It's your basic office with cubes and offices and conference rooms and includes a grassy patio area.  Around 25-30 people work here full time. Its not a job you can really work from home consistently as it requires in person collaboration and is hands on. 

If this job was dog friendly when I was hired, I would have never taken the job.  I can't stand dogs.  Everything about them really.  My dislike of dogs has never impacted my life, career, family, or friends till now.  To be honest, I usually don't bring it up to non friends/family because I get a lot of hate.  So I usually stay quiet and try to remove myself from a situation as best I can. 

We recently had Salary and Benefit review one on one meetings with HR. We are all getting 6% raises. They took suggestions on benefits that we'd like to see.  I gave my input, overall I was pretty happy with our benefits.  However, a number of co-workers said they'd like to see a dog friendly office.  At the conclusion of the meetings HR took their findings to management.  2 weeks after our one on one meetings, management sent out the proposed changes and requested some final input.  Staff had 2 weeks to respond.  

Well the 2 weeks we had to respond, I was on vacation.  I went on a slightly over 2 week trip out of the country that had been planned for well in advance.  On vacation I didn't check emails or messages.  I went offline as much as I could and didn't see the email asking for final input and was not able to raise any objections till I came back.  Well the dog friendly office had overwhelming support with no objections...until I came back to work.  It was supposed to start Jan 1 in the new year. 

Well, I saw the proposal from almost 3 weeks earlier and went straight to HR.  I raised my objections right then.  I told HR that if they were dog friendly when I interviewed I would have never worked here.  I asked them to re-evaluate.  Well they granted my wish and have re-evaluated this and let staff know this is on hold.  They have not committed to anything either way yet with no ETA on a resolution. The thing is, everyone knows it is me and i'm getting the cold shoulder from nearly everyone.  This was very popular and something most were looking forward too.

99,AITA for not wanting to give my adult stepdaughter her own room in our new home?,"Throwaway + fake names.

I (35F) have been with my husband (43M) James for 3 years, married for 18 months. He has a 21 year old daughter from his previous marriage, Jane. Jane and I get along well but she was already away at college by the time her dad and I got serious so we don’t have a very close relationship.

James and I are looking to purchase a home together because our current home is not going to work for me in the long term due to some disabilities. We’ve found a few we liked and we were discussing our options when I referred to the third bedroom as the guest room. James asked what I meant because that would be Jane’s room.

This led to an argument between us because I don’t think Jane needs a dedicated bedroom in our new home. She’s renting her own place now (with roommates) year round, no more student housing. And she still has her room at her mom’s house. Of course she’s always welcome to visit and if she were to ever need to move back in, then we could adjust at that time but as it stands, she’s an adult moving on to the adult portion of her life and it seems silly to dedicate a room for her when she’ll use it for 2 weeks out the year, max.

My husband is upset with me still but I really don’t think his position is that strong. She’s a grown up now. AITA?

100,AITA for sharing my salary at dinner and making my SIL cry?,"Tonight, my fiance (26m) and I (26f) were at dinner with his family. He has a younger brother (18m) and an older sister (29f) who I will refer to as my SIL just because it's simpler. I've been working as a product manager at a big tech company since I got out of college five years ago. My salary has steadily climbed in the last couple of years so now I'm making a very large amount. However, I am a big proponent of salary transparency, especially as a woman in a male-dominated field. I've helped multiple people who were being underpaid negotiate higher salaries after sharing my salary history. I've also helped many younger college students who are looking to go into the industry by sharing my salary.

So this evening, we were discussing the tech industry and how it's become such a popular field to go into. Both me and my fiance work in tech so we were offering our input from our own roles. My fiance's little brother is planning on studying computer science in college so he asked me, rather abruptly, how much I make as a PM. Since I believe in salary transparency, I went ahead and just said, ""Well, after I got promoted to being a senior product manager a few months ago, my current salary is about $300,000."" After I said that, my fiance's brother said ""HOLYY SHIIIIT"" really loudly and then congratulated me and called me impressive. I thanked him and told him that I'd be happy to help him when he starts looking for internships & jobs in college. However, then all of a sudden, my SIL starts sniffling and I look at her and she's wiping tears from her face. My future MIL starts to comfort her and is whispering something, and the whole table goes silent. I immediately apologize and asked what was wrong and she just said ""it's just fucking hard seeing people make that much when I'm making $15/hour working my ass off 50 hours a week."" She also said after that ""some people really do get everything huh?"" and then glared at me and kept crying. Then she excused herself to the bathroom and my MIL followed.

Here's my SIL's situation: she's currently a single mom and is pregnant with her second. She's working a minimum-wage job to support her kid. I'm very empathetic to her situation and my fiance and I have extended a helping hand multiple times (e.g., babysitting, buying her child toys/other gifts/necessities, sending money and supplies, etc.).

Since the incident, she hasn't spoken to me. She actually ended up just walking out from dinner with my future MIL and leaving the rest of us at the restaurant. My MIL did text and told me that I acted insensitively and should give SIL a sincere apology. My fiance's on my side and believes his sister was the one who acted rudely.

101,AITA for asking my SIL not to announce her pregnancy before me,"So context. I (25F) am 8 weeks 3 days pregnant and have been keeping this secret from everyone except  my SIL (28)  for over a month now. I told her as soon as I found out because she’s the only one who knew we were trying. Anyway I had been keeping it a secret so that I could reveal it to my parents with a cute gift on Christmas. SIL knows this plan. She informed me a couple of days ago that she is about 4 weeks pregnant (which I’m super excited about don’t get me wrong). She is married to my family’s “golden child” and they had the first grand baby of the family 3 years ago. After her little one was born my family immediately started asking when the next grand baby was coming. I had mentioned to SIL that I wanted her to wait until after Xmas to tell them since I am farther along than her and have had this moment planned for over a month. And honestly it’s only a week of waiting which I think should be more than doable.

 Normally I wouldn’t care about this kind of thing but I’m kind of the black sheep of our family already and my siblings are always seen as better than me or more important. She had agreed that she would wait until after Xmas to tell my parents so that I could have a moment where my family was excited for me and wasn’t comparing me to any of my siblings. 

Well today she texted me that she’s decided to tell them tonight because they are visiting anyway. I’m kind of upset about this because now when I tell my parents, that rare moment of excitement I’ve been waiting for will be overshadowed by the golden child announcing first. I was going to ask her not to do this today as we had an agreement but now I’m unsure. 

Idk I feel like I’m overreacting but this genuinely hurts my feelings as she knows how excited I was to announce this pregnancy that my parents have been waiting 3 years for.

ETA: I did NOT try to stop her from telling my parents tonight, that’s not my choice, I knew that even when I posted this. I’m excited for her and I love her and I would never try to dim her joy despite what a few of you have implied about me 🥰 I just wanted to know if i was the AH for asking her to wait.

She does work from home and also has really great time off. She’s not in debt or anything but I can’t help but think how much she could be saving if she stops. Her argument is that she’s a budget traveler and people spend more a month eating and getting coffee then her trips have cost her. She puts the maximum in her 401k. Plus she thinks it gives her meaning and she loves it. 

But I can’t help to think of our future, that money could be used for a down payment on our future house. Plus I’m not even going so she’s constantly spending time with me. We recently got into an argument and I told her, her traveling is messing with our future. She says I shouldn’t be counting her “pockets” and called me an AH for trying to take away something she loves.

I think one trip us together a year should be enough. She’s been distant lately and from friends I discovered she just booked ANOTHER trip. So AITA?

Although I’m already clearly being labeled the AH, I’ll add that her time isn’t technically taking away from us as I do traveling sales within the US, so I’m technically gone during her trips.

103,AITA for leaving my friend group to help my friends who got robbed," 

Yesterday was halloween, my friends met up and we all kind of hung around a shopping centre called an IGA (australia) before one of my best friends, tyler, came over and said that his friends would come over and that we need to meet them. Another of my best friends, steve, said they'd come with and asked me to stay behind to get candy from houses and keep an eye on my friends and to meet up at the oval of a park nearby at 7:00 PM.

fast forward a few hours and steve calls another friend, saying ""hey are you guys coming, it's 7:00 PM we need to meet up"". The other friend asks where and he says ""at the kumon park"" (kumon is the name of an education thing that i used to go to and it was right next to the park). apparently nobody thinks of telling me anything because they all decide to bunch up and head to a completely different place before steve calls again, sounding more pissed off; ""pass the phone to TheEqualizer1212"", they give me the phone and i hear where he meant to meet up and i tell the group to start moving in that direction, however, i am known as the group dumbass so literally nobody follows me and then after a while, steve calls me again, sounding incredibly pissed off ""Dude i got fucking robbed by some dickheads who go to our school"" (he specified who it was, im just not mentioning it because this is the internet.), i tell the group that he got robbed and that he sounded very pissed and they all dont believe me and start scouring more houses for candy. Eventually i get pissed right the fuck off that nobody wants to help my friends who got robbed and say ""you know what? Fuck this!"" and start running in the direction that he wanted us to go to.

i get there and he asks where the group is and i tell him the truth; nobody believed him, thought i was lying, started scouring the neighbourhood for candy, and, he gets even more pissed off that nobody believed him, his friends get pissed off too that they had to fight people for their shit and nobody but me came to help, my mates, steve, tyler and their friends never got any candy because they were meeting up and trying to not get robbed. i gave them my candy and stuck with them, eventually we told tyler and his friends to leave and enjoy halloween, found the group, tried to ask why the fuck they didnt believe us and their excuse was: ""he said it in a way that didn't sound like it was true!"" and then victimised themselves, screamed at me and steve and we both left angry. tommorrow will be an interesting school day.",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for leaving my friend group to help my friends who got robbed","

105,AITA for taking my daughters “emotional support” dog back to the shelter?,"My daughter is 17. I’m 47. My wife is 44. My daughter had been having problems with her anxiety and depression, school had been very hard for her and she asked us if she could get an animal for “emotional support”. I asked her why we couldn’t just put her in regular therapy again but she said she didn’t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn’t want to try it again.

I was pretty against bringing an animal into the home as my daughter can barely keep her room clean and remember to wash her dishes, much less take care of an animal. And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog because I work long hours and didn’t want to be picking up messes when I got home. My wife said I was being unfair and that this could be what my daughter needed to get back in good spirits.

So we got her a dog. We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care (such as frequent grooming and other traits) and I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference. 

The dog was great at first and it got along with my daughter and wife greatly. Me not so much, but it could probably sense I didn’t really like it either. But then it started getting out of its leash on walks, tearing up the couch and various other toys we bought it. My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I’d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet. 

I warned her twice that if she didn’t start taking responsibility that the dog would be going back and she gave me excuses saying she was feeling depressed again. She said she would do better, but didn’t. Ultimately, I got fed up so one day when she went to school I loaded the dog in my truck and told the shelter he wasn’t a good fit for us.

Obviously when she came home she was upset. She was saying the dog was her best friend but I told her that she wasn’t taking very good care of him, and he didn’t deserve that. Wife says it was very harsh to just take the dog back while she was gone, but she agrees daughter wasn’t responsible. My daughter has been saying I brought back her severe depression and we haven’t been talking.

106,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend’s mum at our wedding?,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriends mum at our wedding?

My boyfriend and I had a rough start of our relationship. We met online, he moved to my country and left his family, apartment and job behind. He did everything to make our relationship work out. No matter how thankful I am for that, there always have been a few arguments about stuff that concerned me (ex girlfriend still in his life, texting edgy stuff to other girls etc.). Making him move in here, finding a job, car and proper life standards was not easy too. We were both stressed (I had many important exams at that time and was dealing with mental problems). 
One day we had a really big argument, I don’t want to go too much into the details. I basically found some explicit stuff from other girls on his phone and some spicy chats. I confronted him and he couldn’t explain it much to me. At this time I felt really broken and hopeless, it took me a few days to come to the conclusion of wanting to break up with him. As we talked about it, things got out of control again and I ended up staying at my parents place for a while. 
He must’ve texted his mother about our argument and that I wanted to break up with him, I don’t know what exactly they chatted about, but his mum ended up texting me on facebook, threatening me and insulting me in the worst way (I can’t write that out on reddit the post would be banned). She was basically threatening me to end my life and called me out as a b…ch. 
This was a while ago, and my boyfriend and I are fine now, but his mother never apologized to me though. We just ignore any topic that’s about her. 
Half a year ago my boyfriend proposed to me, I said yes. We are planning our wedding now and we don’t want a big wedding, only close friends and family. Here is the problem: I don’t feel comfortable to have his mother around on our big day, if she wouldn’t apologize to me.
So far when we tried to reach out to her, nothing good came along, and obviously far away from an apology.  He is arguing to me that he wants his mum around, he loves her no matter what. He also says, that me expecting her to apologize is too much to ask for. I am completely frustrated and I want my boyfriend to be happy too, that requires to forgive his mum for what she did and just invite her without feeling good about it. 
I don’t know what to do.

107,AITA for telling my husband to get rid of our son’s dog?,"I’ve been terrified of dogs since I was young. My husband knew but I don’t think he realised how bad it was until recently. He got our son a dog and at first, I was angry but he promised it wouldn’t come near me and our son was really happy so I agreed they could keep it as long as it was kept away from me.

For 2 months it was fine and I barely thought about the dog being so close but a few days ago the dog came inside and it freaked me out. I told my husband he had to get rid of it now since he broke his promise and I didn’t trust him to keep it away from me anymore.

My husband doesn’t want to get rid of it because our son is very attached to it already and the dog is harmless according to him. He wants me to let him take me around the dog so that I’ll stop being so scared of it but I’ve refused and told him it had to go. We argued and he told me that if I wanted it gone, I would have to take it myself.

My in-laws came to visit yesterday and my mother-in-law asked me if something had happened between us because I’m still angry at him and she noticed. I told her about the dog and she told him off and said she taught him better than to traumatise his pregnant wife. Now my husband is upset at me because he thinks I only told his parents to force him to do what I wanted and that we’d hurt our son if we got rid of the dog now.

My husband and I  took in his cousin Sues newborn due to her and her partner Johns addiction issues. 
Its not a decision I regret. This beautiful boy is the light of my life but it was a major life change for us. Especially me as I was the one who gave up my job and my social life to be basically locked up isolated during covid with a baby. It was supposed to be temporary while they went to rehab. They never went to rehab nor complied with any of the safety plan set up by  CPS. From 2 months on they have not seen the baby nor supported him in any way. Johns family has not been involved either as they also refused to abide by the safetyplan or any of the CPS recommendations.
Now 2 years later my husband and I have full legal custody and CPS has closed the file. We have put forth a petition to change the baby's name. At birth john and sue named the boy Steven to ""honor"" John's brother who died of an overdose (while partying with John and Sue who was PREGNANT and getting high) 
My husband and I have never ever referred to the baby by that name. We always called him Davey (his middle name) after Sue and my husband's grandfather.
So instead of being Steven David Jones we are changing it to David Owen Smith. Owen is after my father who absolutely adores him and accepted him as grandson from day one.
So here's where I might have ventured to asshole. My husband thinks I went too far but I feel they pushed me to the end.
John's family found out and blew up my social media and messaging.(not husbands just mine) Telling me that I have no right to change the name or honour my father because I'm nothing more than a babysitter and I'm not the real mother. I was called a babythief amongst more vile accusations. So I snapped and  responded back that MY son's names will honour good men that he could proudly emulate not like their junkie relative who was a shitstain on the world defrauding the govt for benefits and stealing from anyone he could and contributed nothing to life or society and his only accomplishment is that he odeed before he went to prison.

I ask them if they called or texted my husband or myself and they admit they had hadn't but they didn't see the issue since I was home. I remind them of our rule and tell them they need to leave. My FIL gets huffy saying they drove over an hour to see our daughter and they should be allowed in. 

I explained that I understand that but since they didn't check with us first they needed to leave. I go to close the door and my MIL puts her foot in the way to prevent the door from closing. At this point I'm getting extremely frustrated as I have other things I need to take care of. 

My MIL explains that since it was such a long drive they should at least be let in for a few minutes to visit. At this point my husband comes home and my in laws are under the impression my husband will let them in. He doesn't. He tells them to leave and at this point they're trespassing. 

We have a no trespassing sign on a tree by the house. It's clearly visible. My husband reminds them of our rule and tells them to leave. They refuse. My husband then tells them he has no choice but to call the police and have them removed from the property. 

My in-laws think he's bluffing but my husband isn't a bluffer. He calls the sheriff and has his parents removed from the property.

111,AITA for saying someone is short and fat?,"A girl (18F) at my school is a fat positivity activist on TikTok. She films herself eating, twerking, and making the fat on her butt jiggle for the camera while saying how in love with her body she is.
She also says all the time that being fat is an honor and beautiful. This is important for later on.

For a public speaking assignment in class, she wrote about how modeling should be illegal because the models in fashion week are skinny and tall, and they look like freaks and not like normal girls. And they make everyone feel uncomfortable watching them. The whole assignment was about speaking calmly and effectively, but she was speaking very angrily and aggressively.

I’m pretty sure her whole speech was just directed at me because it’s known at school that I walk in fashion week, and she was weirdly staring me down during the speech.

For the audience counter argument part, the teacher then asked me what I thought of the arguments since I walk in fashion week. I said I thought it was all pretty ridiculous, of course.

The girl and her girls came up to me and my friends at lunch and said that I’m eating fruit salad because of I have disordered eating, which I don’t. She then said “You’re only allowed to walk because you’re tall and skinny, just so you know” in a derogatory way. I said “And you’re not allowed to because you’re short and fat. What’s your point?”

She yelled “And the mask is off. I was just waiting for you to show your bigotry and insult me.”

However, if being fat is an honor and beautiful as she always says, I don’t see how stating she’s fat is an insult or bigoted. I would be pissed if someone called me fat, but that’s because I don’t see it as an honor, and she supposedly does.",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for saying someone is short and fat?","A girl (18F) at my school is a fat positivity activist on TikTok.

112,AITA for threatening to call the landlord if my roommate allows a guest to stay at our apartment?,"I (20F) have a roommate (24M) and we split rent 50/50 for a two bed apartment. We get along pretty well and have never had any problems. 

As part of our renters agreement with the landlord, we're only allowed one guest over at a time for a week max with the consent of the other roommate. So if I want to have a friend stay with me for a few days, my roommate has to agree and vice versa. We both have had friends over before and it's always gone over peacefully. We both also have had more than one friend over with no issues because we respected eachother's space and belongings. It's important to note here that I've only ever invited over other women, and he's only ever invited over other men. Our guests also stay in our own bedrooms.


Three weeks ago, one of my friends, Mike (22M) needed a place to stay for three days because he was leaving an abusive partner. I asked my roommate if it was alright to have him over for those three days. I explained the sensitivity of the situation and I promised, as always, to cover any extra expenses caused by Mike being over. My roommate refused because he said he didn't feel comfortable with a man being invited over. I had no clue what he was talking about it and I was very annoyed, but I respected his choice. My friends and I put money together to get Mike a hotel room for those three days instead. 


Today, my roommate asked if he could have two friends over for Friday and the Weekend. I said no because it was against the renters rules. He was confused because we've both agreed to break the rules before, but I said to him that I didn't feel comfortable with two strange men over. He could tell straight away that I was doing it to annoy him because he didn't let Mike stay over, plus I have met the friends he was inviting over before. He told me to stop being childish because he has a right to refuse guests for being uncomfortable whereas I was doing it to be annoying. What's even more irritating is that he has met Mike before and they get along with eachother. He then said he'd invite them over anyway but I said I'd call the landlord if he did so.

I yelled at her “Come over here!” And she responded with, “No, I don’t want to go home!” and started to cry.

118,AITA for attending one niece's college party and not the other?,"This happened months ago but as we are still arguing over this, I wanted to ask here and see what others think

I have two nieces(Sasha and Nora) who both graduated from highschool this year. In my family we don't throw college parties. The only times someone throws a college party is when they get accepted in a good college.

Sasha got accepted in a good college but Nora is going to community college

The problem started when both my sister and sil(their moms) decided to throw the parties in the same day. The parties are also in two different towns so no way we can attend both. I don't know why but none of them would change the date. Eventually I ended up going to Sasha's party as she is the one who got accepted in a good college and like everyone else in our family who did the same she desrves to have her party. 

Turned out I wasn't the only one who thought so and almost everyone in our family has decided to come to Sasha's party.

Nora's mom was extremely angry. She called all of us and yelled at us and said we are assholes

It has been months and she still mad and not talking to anyone

Edit: do me a favor and tell me how I could NOT be the asshole her because how I see it my only options were

1. Go to Sasha's party which everyone clearly thinks was the asshole move

2. Go to Nora's party which I don't see why it would be any different than going to Sasha's

3. Cut myself in two pieces and send each piece to each party which seems like what everyone is suggesting

Edit: I see a lot of projection in the comments. So because we didn't go to Nora's party we have been neglecting her and favoring Sasha their entire lives? Where did you even get that from? 

And do you really believe that two achievements that are not equal should be equally celebrated? Both girls play sports so if Nora's team won and Sasha's team became 9th should we celebrate both of them equally?

Eventually I ended up going to Sasha's party as she is the one who got accepted in a good college and like everyone else in our family who did the same she desrves to have her party. 

Turned out I wasn't the only one who thought so and almost everyone in our family has decided to come to Sasha's party.

Nora's mom was extremely angry. She called all of us and yelled at us and said we are assholes

It has been months and she still mad and not talking to anyone

Edit: do me a favor and tell me how I could NOT be the asshole her because how I see it my only options were

1. Go to Sasha's party which everyone clearly thinks was the asshole move

2. Go to Nora's party which I don't see why it would be any different than going to Sasha's

3. Cut myself in two pieces and send each piece to each party which seems like what everyone is suggesting

Edit: I see a lot of projection in the comments. So because we didn't go to Nora's party we have been neglecting her and favoring Sasha their entire lives? Where did you even get that from? 

And do you really believe that two achievements that are not equal should be equally celebrated? Both girls play sports so if Nora's team won and Sasha's team became 9th should we celebrate both of them equally? Asking opinion from a bunch of entitled teenagers was a mistake so I won't be reading the comments anymore"
119,AITA for crying and asking my boyfriend to leave over a burger?,"I (21F) recently found out I’m pregnant (woo…/s) getting to the 6 month mark, it’s a complicated pregnancy and I’m exhausted.

My boyfriend (28) moved in with me because of it, it wasn’t expected but we’re making do. I’m training to be a teacher and he’s currently looking for employment, technically I’m working two jobs to support the both of us it’s tiring, but he’s looking so it’s not over that.

There’s a local burger place I’d been wanting, we rarely go but I’ve been having cravings - they shut at a certain time.

He agreed to it, he agreed to ordering since they only have one veggie burger I like, it’s not as though there’s multiple things I can have.

They shut at 9, I got home at 840 and he hadn’t ordered and by the time he went to it was too late, I started crying because I’ve been craving that all week and all I wanted was a burger and a hot shower, I couldn’t even have a shower since he used the last of the hot water.

He didn’t apologise and offered to go Burger King, which I didn’t want and he got all silent claiming I’m being an AH since he’s been job hunting all day (as I see it my day started at 6am and ended when I got in bed at 930, his day started at 9am and ended at 930, but I’ve got the extra weight of pregnancy) we got into an argument about how we’re comparing days and that he’s overwhelmed.

 I asked him to leave, because I don’t like arguing and he had to stay in his car since he moved in with me (away from friends)

He argued that I’m blowing it out of the window because I’m pregnant and not considering his feelings, because he’s overwhelmed, so am I?  My friends say I’m the AH because he’s probably in over his head, and had to sleep in his car over a burger.

AITA?

I know I said woo to be sarcastic, I’m not excited but I do love the baby already

120,AITA for keeping the same financial agreement with my wife?,"I(31M) recently completed my PhD and a postdoc position. I didn't make much money during that period, about 26k annually for my PhD, and about 32k while I was working as a postdoc. My wife(30F), who I married about when I got my PhD, makes a shitload more than me, or made a shitload more than me. She made about 100k while we were together, so quite a bit of a gap. She also came up with the idea that we should put some of our income for ourselves and some for the family, and this would be proportional to our income, to keep it ""fair"".

She always got a bit fancier stuff than me, and I was pretty jealous. I didn't voice it to her, which I guess should've, but I don't understand how she doesn't realize it.

I don't want to reveal too much information, but while I was working as a postdoc, I made connections with a couple people who were starting up a company. Long story short, last year I made 300k without including my stake in the company. It is obviously risky, but I think the risk had paid off for me at least.

I did get a Tesla Model S, which I am entirely paying with my own money, including the insurance. And I'm starting to buy more expensive stuff for me too, and it honestly feels amazing.

Now, she is asking if we should just combine our incomes, and each get the same amount of ""our money"", which feels like total bullshit. She wants to eat her cake and have it too. And I just said no, she wasn't being fair. She then went on a spiel about equity, which I honestly did not listen to. I mean, she is allowed to make that suggestion, but I am allowed to say no, right?

121,"AITA for giving my sister a secondhand ""girls"" stroller at her babyshower?","I (f25) have a younger sister Heidi (f21).

Heidi is pregnant and the baby is due very soon. The father broke up with her as soon as he found out she was pregnant and she had to move back in with our parents.

Our mom held a babyshower for Heidi last week and Heidi made a gift registry. She knows the baby is going to be a boy. Heidi sent out email invites to everyone with a link to the registry and there was about 3 paragraphs repeating over and over that she will only take gifts that are off the registry and that nothing else is acceptable, which I thought was kind of entitled but oh well.

One of the gifts on the registry was a stroller, which I know can get quite expensive. 

I have a stroller that I used for my daughter (f3), and I don't plan on having any more kids so I don't need the stroller anymore. The stroller is pretty standard, and it's plain and a rose gold/dusty pink kind of colour.

122,AITA for having a photo of my son's dna test framed and hanging in the living room?,"



I m32 met my wife 3 years ago. We got married 9 months ago. We have a baby boy together that she got pregnent with while we were engaged. My wife used to be a s_x worker. No judgement on that please! She did what she had to do to survive. My parents were always being ""skeptical"" about her and lot of times asked if I wanna settle down with her. When she got prengnent, they went nuts and demanded a dna test. They refused to attend the wedding til the dna test was done which caused a huge problem.


They ended up missing the wedding obviously. The test was done BECAUSE my wife wanted to prove a point and eventually my parents made ammends and we reconciled.


They started visiting and yesterday noticed the photo of the dna test that I hang in the living room. They asked about it and I told that it serves as a reminder for why they didn't attend my wedding, they were stunned and livid when I mentioned that I tell any guest the same thing I told them. Mom and dad were mad and asked me repeatedly to take it down saying I'm being too harsh on them and refusing to let go of the past as well as embarrassing them to the other family members. I refused to take it down and I admit being sarcastic in my response saying ""it goes with the hoise decor!.""


They begged then refused to come over anymore til I remove it. My brother thinks it's petty and childish and said I should take it down.


Alright I'm editing some stuff in. First of all, my wife does not mind having the photo up , she laughs about it sometimes but she's still carrying some hurt that was caused by what happened. And second of all, no, she no longer does s_x work it's all in the past.

123,AITA for refusing to sell my ex the cottage his grandfather left me but being willing to sell it to somebody my ex hates?,"My ex’s grandfather passed away in 2020. We were very close and he left me the cottage he bought his late wife. My ex and his brothers have spent the last 2 years trying to convince me to sell the cottage to them. I’ve refused because while I understand the cottage is important to them and their family, it was also important to me and I didn’t want to give it up.

Unfortunately, due to their actions, the cottage now has more negative emotions tied to it than positives so I want to get rid of it. I won’t sell it to them, especially not to my ex because he’s hurt me badly.

I have a friend, who my ex hates, who has offered to buy it from me. I know he’s only offering because he knows it’ll hurt my ex but I’m considering selling it to him. My ex’s brothers have been trying to convince me not to do it as they’re convinced he’ll have the cottage destroyed. 

My ex confronted me about it a few days ago and told me I’m being spiteful and his grandfather would never forgive me if the cottage was destroyed. He told me he would rather I keep it over me selling it to my friend and he was willing to do whatever it took to stop me from selling it.

My cousin thinks I should just sell it to my ex and be done with it as she doesn't think my ex will take this lying down and she thinks I'll regret doing this in the long term. However, I don't want to sell it to him or anybody else in his family.

He was a widower with a 7 month old son (I think he was 7 months old when they met). She instantly moved them in and started claiming his son as her own and raising him like us. She got engaged to him and a few weeks before the wedding our dad died. By this point my mom had just become estranged from her entire extended family. She told my dad's parents that if they wanted to see us again soon, they would need to come to her wedding and watch all three of us (including my stepbrother). She then told them after the wedding that going forward if they wanted to see us, or spend time with us, they had to include him. They hadn't wanted to. They tried to argue for time with just us.

My child likes to reach out and touch his feet to the chair in front so we were relieved that we didn't have to spend the entire flight fighting his legs off the seat in front.  ( there's nothing worse than sitting in front of someone smashing your seat from behind the whole time). The doors close and a woman from the back of the plane decided to come up and take the window seat in front of my kid. 

Then starts the hour plus struggle of fighting legs off of the seat, intermixed with him being upset we were trying to pin his legs down.  We were just hoping to get him to sleep so everyone could get some rest. The woman started looking back huffing every time her seat was nudged even before take off.

I explained how the airline dictated my kid had to be in the window seat due to his car seat otherwise I'd have moved him.  She escalated and eventually called the flight attendant.

126,AITA for telling my autistic sister I wish she was never born?,"I'm 16f, my sister I'd 13f. She's autistic but she wasn't diagnosed until she was 12. She presented as a gifted kid for most of her life, excelling academically, and at sports, popular, the whole 9 yards. I'm diagnosed with adhd, have been since I was like 5. I fell behind academically and at sports and I'm not very popular. I do excell in art, which is the one area my sister is shit at. Other than that, she's better at me than almost everything, with the exception of being a genuinely nice person. 

We have different dads and our mother isn't with either man. My sisters dad earns considerably more than my dad does, which naturally means my sister was put in a lot more extracurricular activities, got more extravagant Christmas and birthday presents, etc etc. I used to be jealous but i understand its not her fault, but she did end up incredibly spoiled because of that. 

My dad got me a 24-pack of Posca markers for my birthday, which was last month. I think this was the first time my sister was ever vocally jealous of me and its because its over the one thing she's not good at. 

My sister took it upon herself to try her hand at art because she was off school for some teacher training today, and decided to use my shit instead of a pack of pencils. She destroyed the markers to the point they're not usable. Some are empty fucking somehow, even though I had a 6 pack for about 2 years without destroying them and the rest, she managed to ruin the fucking nib on.

I got angry at her, and I told her I wish she had never been born.

She's autistic but she wasn't diagnosed until she was 12. She presented as a gifted kid for most of her life, excelling academically, and at sports, popular, the whole 9 yards. I'm diagnosed with adhd, have been since I was like 5. I fell behind academically and at sports and I'm not very popular. I do excell in art, which is the one area my sister is shit at. Other than that, she's better at me than almost everything, with the exception of being a genuinely nice person. 

We have different dads and our mother isn't with either man. My sisters dad earns considerably more than my dad does, which naturally means my sister was put in a lot more extracurricular activities, got more extravagant Christmas and birthday presents, etc etc. I used to be jealous but i understand its not her fault, but she did end up incredibly spoiled because of that. 

My dad got me a 24-pack of Posca markers for my birthday, which was last month. I think this was the first time my sister was ever vocally jealous of me and its because its over the one thing she's not good at. 

My sister took it upon herself to try her hand at art because she was off school for some teacher training today, and decided to use my shit instead of a pack of pencils. She destroyed the markers to the point they're not usable. Some are empty fucking somehow, even though I had a 6 pack for about 2 years without destroying them and the rest, she managed to ruin the fucking nib on.

I got angry at her, and I told her I wish she had never been born.

127,AITA for allowing a customer to be recorded in my store after she made a complaint about an autistic employee?,"I’m a supervisor at a small store. There’s a employee Amber 30 who knows the store in and out. Does our displays and can do anything in the store.  She’s also autistic and doesn’t say much when checking people out and doesn’t really look people in the eye. 
We had a woman come in and try to make small talk with Amber. Somehow this women I’m thinking anywhere from 30-45 years got offended because she felt disrespected by Amber not making small talk with her. 

I get over there and she launches a complaint about Amber who is the nicest person in the store. I loudly say to her “I hope you feel good about bullying autistic people today? Why because they wouldn’t meet some imaginary standards you have” the women tries to defend her situation about how Amber shouldn’t be cashier if she can make polite conversation. I noticed a teenager filming the woman and I tell her I’m sorry that you feel like people with disabilities don’t deserve jobs because you feel like everyone should carry on a conversation with you. The woman noticed the teen filming her and asked her to stop and the customer got called a main character.  She repeatedly asked the teen to stop filming and tried to explain her position again and just started cry saying she was actually the one having a bad day and said she was sorry the customer left crying. Another older lady (80’s) said it it was ridiculous that you can’t even make a basic complaint anymore without someone recording you. Amber went home early from her shift after being up about the crying customer.

128,AITA for calling out my ex's new wife for being unemployed,"This is a weird title but here's what actually happened. My ex and I broke up 5 years ago after a year-long relationship, he broke up with me and I took it very hard back then. I can't say I did anything crazy, aside from a few weeks after the break up getting really drunk on a night out and sending him some embarrassing texts. It was the worst heartbreak I've ever had, and it didn't help that he kept messaging me to be ""friends"" even though I tried to set boundaries and say I need space to heal. 

Anyways, that's all in the past. I can confidently say that I have indeed healed from that and am over him. He recently got married to a girl he started dating like 2 months after we broke up. Honestly, I'm happy for him. Good for them. Me, on the other hand, I've dated since then but haven't been able to find anyone worth marrying; I haven't even had another serious relationship since him. 

He's still in the periphery of my social circle, because we still have a lot of mutual friends from uni. And sometimes I see both of them in social settings. While he and I have buried the hatchet and usually just chat when we happen to be in the same room for a bit (although we never text or meet up outside of these contexts), his wife and I have always treated each other with polite disinterest. I know she really doesn't like me. An important note about her is that she's been unemployed for a loooong time. Idk if its because she wants to be a stay-at-home-wife (completely valid choice if that's her thing!) or because she's been unable to find work, but she hasn't worked in many years despite having a masters degree. I've been really able to advance in my career in the past 5 years, and I'm quite far ahead in my field for someone my age and I'm very proud of myself because I worked extremely hard. 

Anyways here's the issue: the other day a bunch of people went for drinks. I came. They were both there. We were all sitting at the same table in a bar. Someone I haven't seen in awhile asked me if I'm dating anyone. I replied ""no, not right now."" My ex's wife quickly made a snark comment ""aw it's okay, some people just stay single"" in front of everyone, like 10 of our friends.  Without missing a beat, I blurted out ""yeah just like some people are meant to stay unemployed"". 

She got really upset, cried and left. Her husband messaged me that I should apologize to her for embarrassing her. I said I will if she apologizes first. He said she refused because what I said was worse, apparently.

I asked her why she would even defend Gabrielle and she said she doesn't like jealous insecure women.

133,AITA for telling my wife that she can stay home this Thanksgiving?,"

My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.


As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.

She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the ""perfect compromise"".


Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week.

134,AITA for letting my brother go hungry to make a point?,"I’m 29, my brother Sam is 27, our sister Amy is 32, and Sam’s wife (Nora) is 26.

I don’t like Nora at all. She’s lazy, nosy, a know it all, and lacks all social skills. Once Amy and I were debating about the best way to sear a steak when Nora injected herself into our conversation and tried to explain to us the exact method and type of pan to use. I didn’t call her out but I silently asked myself what the hell does she know about cooking steak, she’s a vegan. Another time Nora asked me about my 401k account and how much I have in it. Again, I was silently thinking to myself about how rude she was for asking about how much money I have in there (not much btw). No matter what you’re talking about, she’ll have something to say. Another time she was talking about dinosaurs for a good hour at dinner. We all just sat there (long after we were done eating) to be polite but no one talked because no one cared about dinosaurs and she never paused to take a breath to give anyone a chance to change the topic. Worst of all, she’s a stay at home wife.

Not a stay at home mom, they have no kids, a stay at home wife. There’s nothing wrong with her physically to prevent her from working, she claimed she has anxiety that prevents her from working. I’m not a doctor but I don’t see any anxiety when she’s shopping at Target or out at the beach during our family outings. Normally I wouldn’t concern myself with Sam’s family but it’s affecting me.

I don’t see anything wrong with a one income family as long as that income can support that family. In Sam’s case, his income can’t support him and his wife. I’ve had to loan him money at least a dozen times since he married Nora. They’re always short on the rent or don’t have money for the utility bills or whatever. Last week Sam asked to borrow $50 for lunch for the week because he’s short again. I love my kid brother but I had enough. I told him no and that he would have lunch money if his lazy wife works. We argued because he took offense at me calling her lazy. He later told Amy about our argument and she yelled at me for willing to let him go hungry. She loaned him the money. I told her he needs to go hungry to see that his wife is a leech.

AITA?",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for letting my brother go hungry to make a point?","I’m 29, my brother Sam is 27, our sister Amy is 32, and Sam’s wife (Nora) is 26.

I don’t like Nora at all. She’s lazy, nosy, a know it all, and lacks all social skills. Once Amy and I were debating about the best way to sear a steak when Nora injected herself into our conversation and tried to explain to us the exact method and type of pan to use. I didn’t call her out but I silently asked myself what the hell does she know about cooking steak, she’s a vegan. Another time Nora asked me about my 401k account and how much I have in it. Again, I was silently thinking to myself about how rude she was for asking about how much money I have in there (not much btw). No matter what you’re talking about, she’ll have something to say. Another time she was talking about dinosaurs for a good hour at dinner. We all just sat there (long after we were done eating) to be polite but no one talked because no one cared about dinosaurs and she never paused to take a breath to give anyone a chance to change the topic. Worst of all, she’s a stay at home wife.

Not a stay at home mom, they have no kids, a stay at home wife. There’s nothing wrong with her physically to prevent her from working, she claimed she has anxiety that prevents her from working. I’m not a doctor but I don’t see any anxiety when she’s shopping at Target or out at the beach during our family outings. Normally I wouldn’t concern myself with Sam’s family but it’s affecting me.

I don’t see anything wrong with a one income family as long as that income can support that family. In Sam’s case, his income can’t support him and his wife. I’ve had to loan him money at least a dozen times since he married Nora. They’re always short on the rent or don’t have money for the utility bills or whatever.

135,AITA for blowing up on my mom after I found her mocking my wife's fanfiction?,"I'm pretty pissed right now. My mom has always worked in creative fields including as a professional writer, so I would not expect this from her. 

Recently we both (meaning my mom and her husband, and my wife and I) went to visit my grandfather for his birthday. We were all staying at his house. My wife got up to make some breakfast and came back in tears. She said she overheard my mom and her husband making fun of her and they have her fanfiction profile up, and were reading her work. She said she didn't confront them as she was too embarrassed, and they didn't see her as they were both laying in the hammock thing outside and neither were facing her.

I went out and they were both leaned over my mom's phone giggling. I demanded to know what they were laughing at and my mom said nothing and told me to stop being weird. I told her I knew and she better not lie to me. She admitted she had been reading my wife's fanfiction but said it wasn't a big deal. I asked why they were laughing then. He said ""because it is fanfiction"" and my mom said because it was really poorly written and creepy.

I was like you literally are a published author, and my mom said that is totally different as she is coming up with her own ideas and not stealing someone elses. She said the stuff was just objectively funny and after reading it she was worried about our marriage. 

I blew up and said she should worry about her own marriage as her husband married a bitch. I said her whole career was a joke and she thinks she is smart, but she is dumb enough to isolate the woman her son loves. My mom giggled and said I was literally crazy and why can't we just admit fanfiction is lame and weird.

My poor wife pretty much hid all day and shed some tears over it. I ended up getting my hands on a copy of one of her books as my grandpa's wife had it in her book shelf. I pulled it out at dinner in front of a couple other people and handed it to her husband and said that maybe he should worry about their marriage because apparently my mom wants to fuck her stepbrother because she wrote some erotica about it.

My (f21) boyfriend (m24) of almost a year, invited me to dinner with his family. (Mom, dad and his 16yr old brother.) Never met them prior to that. The only thing I knew about them is that they’re conservative and christians but lovely people. 

And they were. I got along really well with them, before dinner. They were lovely and talkative. When it was time for dinner, my bfs dad wanted to pray. After praying he said, something alone the lines of “let us dig and let the food keep us quiet.” This is a pretty popular saying in our country, mostly told to young children in school. My understanding of this has always been that you shouldn’t speak with food in your mouth or be extremely loud at the table. I wouldn't say its a cultural thing, though.

I dug in, took a bite. It was fish soup. Absolutely delicious. And y’know, like a good guest I wanted to compliment the cook. “This is delicious - is it saffron? A perfect autumn soup!” My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, “Let the food keep us quiet.” I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word.

I saw her as my own mother. We kept close contact up until the end. When I found out she'd passed I was devastated. Her funeral was yesterday and I went without receiving an invite (didn't know you needed an invite to a funeral but I guess this is important for later).

If you didn't get it from the title, I'm pregnant with my ex's child. Unfortunate situation since he's back with his wife and things are tense but that's the current situation.

I even sat at the back so as to avoid getting attention however attention came and my ex's wife came to me saying that I was not invited and crashing the funeral so I must leave. Luckily my ex's older brother intervened and said that I was welcomed.

140,AITA for not wanting an unleashed dog coming up to my wife and I in a dog friendly brewery,"Throwaway as I don't want my real comment history altering judgement

Wife and I had a Pub Pass to use, its one of the last 5 places we need to finish the book.   Its something where you get a free beer for going to a brewery. Look it up its pretty cool.  Anyway, looking online at the place my wife and I were planning to go it said it was a dog friendly place.

Both my Wife and I are not dog people, we don't like them.  We do our best to avoid them and when they are present we don't interact with them, but are respectful.  Usually a gentle go away is enough.  Its amazing how many people expect you to interact with their dog though.  We knew it was possible that this was a place we wouldn't hang out at long, but went anyway to get our Pub Pass stamp and our free beer.   We didn't plan to be their more than 15 minutes.  This was just a taphouse with rotating food trucks.  No kitchen on site.

We arrive, head to the bar, and take our seat. Its apparent this place is very dog friendly based off the signage.  At the time we saw a few dogs but took seats as far away from dogs as possible.  Well within 2 minutes someone's unleashed dog comes walking up to us and sniffing around my wifes leg, she repositions and it keeps following.  We tell it to go away, it doesn't. I finally grab it by the collar and take it to the otherside of the bar and leave it.  Clearly the owner doesn't care if its wandering.  I go to wash my hands, and get gross dog germs off me.

I come out, sit down, 2 minutes later the dog is back and now is licking me.  Finally, i just yell, ""who's effing dog is this?, effing come get it"". Finally a guy comes over and says ""oh fido is just being friendly, just give it some pets and he'll move along"".  I kinda flipped out, Told him I don't like his dog, i don't know his dog, i don't trust his dog, i don't want to be around it and not so kindly suggested he leash it and keep his dog near him.  My wife agrees with me, but the bartender essentially kicked us out based on my reaction.  So AITA?

141,AITA for telling my wife that her investing losses are not my problem?,"I (30m) come from a very poor family, but my wife is from a very rich one. She started off the marriage with a net worth of 31 million dollars, and I started it off with 300k dollars in student debt.

When we got married, she made me get a prenup that separated her inheritance and got rid of my right to an ""elective share"" to it if she dies. In other words, I renounced my spousal right to a third of her separate property if she dies, making her sole beneficiaries her siblings or potential children. My debt and our incomes were also separated. We both got lawyers -- hers much more expensive than mine -- and notarized the prenup.

None of this was a problem for me -- as a man, I'm determined to pull myself up by the bootstraps, not rely on my wife's wealth for anything. The only beneficial part of the prenup for me was that our incomes were also now separate, and I earned a somewhat higher income than her, and so I was okay with it overall.

Five years later, I still don't have a seventh of her current wealth, but her investments haven't been doing great this year either.

As a sole crypto investor, things have been going very poorly for her. I had warned her not to do this, but she invests in a cryptocurrency called ""Monero,"" which is down 47 percent this year. About 5 percent of her money was not in her wallet and was in the FTX exchange itself, which she lost after FTX went bankrupt recently. She now has a net worth of around 18 million dollars.

I don't invest in crypto, but rather in index funds. They've taken a hit this year as well, but based on historical performance, they should go back up eventually. No such guarantee for cryptocurrencies, and certainly not for Monero.

I came home to her crying the other day after she found out that FTX went bankrupt. I told her ""that's rough"" -- not in a sarcastic way -- and I went upstairs to change.

When I got back downstairs, she started bitching and complaining, talking about how ""nonchalant"" I was being about her losing money. I pointed out that she's still extraordinarily rich in spite of her poor choices and that she could stop investing in crypto at any time if she wanted to. Besides, she was the one that wanted to separate everything, so why does she want to make it my problem all of a sudden?

About 5 percent of her money was not in her wallet and was in the FTX exchange itself, which she lost after FTX went bankrupt recently. She now has a net worth of around 18 million dollars.

I don't invest in crypto, but rather in index funds. They've taken a hit this year as well, but based on historical performance, they should go back up eventually. No such guarantee for cryptocurrencies, and certainly not for Monero.

I came home to her crying the other day after she found out that FTX went bankrupt. I told her ""that's rough"" -- not in a sarcastic way -- and I went upstairs to change.

When I got back downstairs, she started bitching and complaining, talking about how ""nonchalant"" I was being about her losing money. I pointed out that she's still extraordinarily rich in spite of her poor choices and that she could stop investing in crypto at any time if she wanted to. Besides, she was the one that wanted to separate everything, so why does she want to make it my problem all of a sudden?

142,AITA for spraying perfume straight towards my coworker who refuses to shower?,"So, basically there is this guy, and he smells of sweat really bad. It gets worse from monday to friday, because the smell intensifies and on wednesday its already so bad, I want to puke and it makes my head hurt. 

Now, he's been told by people about it. He didn't believe anyone telling him that. One time he brought his t-shirt to another coworker and asked her if she can smell anything because he can't. That's ridiculous, but whatever. He's been told many many many times, and usually when he is told he smells really bad, a week after you can't smell him, because he might be putting effort into showering, but it doesn't last long. And at this point my manager said, she doesn't want to make him feel bad enough so he wouldn't leave, since we're short on people. 

And I am really sorry for him, he's probably super depressed and can't even shower, which happens. He's a good guy, always friendly and never mean or anything. But holy fuck, I can't suffer it. Imagine coming at work all happy and ready to start a day and then you're hit with this terrible stench, it always ruins my day instantly. 

So anyway, whenever he works closer to me, I literally just spray perfume towards him, I don't even try to be subtle about it anymore, because I really can't take much of it. And I was told by another coworker I'm being an asshole about it. I don't see it really, but maybe I am?


Edit : I want to clarify that I do not spray anything ON him, but more towards his side. For example, he can be 5 meters away, and I just spray it in the air, but towards where he is.

Edit2: Everyone in my work place use some kind of spray just because of him, no one is bothered by it, no one ever complained about that. But people are doing it more subtle, whenever he's not watching. I did the same for a long time, but at this point I'm just done caring about how he feels, I do it whenever I can't bear it anymore, just spray the air towards him.



Edit3 : Thanks for everyone taking their time to say something. I took few advices and I ordered some things to help me more than what I was doing before. To all the people trying to insult me, I think you could find a better way to spend your time than that. To all the people that been helpful, thank you. I learned its really not nice of me, and I will be more open about how I feel, and pressure the HR to do something about it or I will change my job.

143,"AITA for defending my mom to my wife and allowing her to ""ruin"" my son's christening?","My mom and my wife have never had a great relationship. My mom has some issues and my wife has zero patience. I'm not even talking about typical controlling MIL stuff, but more like personal issues. My mom is extremely weird about certain things such as eating, touching people/things, having control over what she wears/ her body. 

She isnt great with social norms and to be honest people do coddle her. My grandparents are just burnt out from raising her and don't even care at this point, and her husband is just happy as long as she is eating enough and doesn't care how bizarrely she behaves.

I don't believe in coddling her, but also feel my wife is controlling sometimes. I believe in giving my mom two choices with one being she can leave or opt out. For example if she wouldn't wear the color my wife picked for our wedding, she could just not be in pictures. If she is being rude and refusing to eat, she can leave the room. However i don't see the point in fighting with her. You are never going to win. 

We recently had a Christening for our son and my mom showed up in a strapless dress which is not allowed in my wife's family's church. My mom has never been to a church in her life and didn't think that was still a rule. To be clear this wasn't some clubbing dress and would have been fine if her shoulders were covered at all. 

My wife told her she can't go in like that and offered her MIL's sweater. My mom refused as it didn't match her dress and she didn't like it. she looked around for something else to wear and then offered to go home and join us for the party later. i thought that was fine but my wife got mad and said she was being selfish and acting like an idiot and demanded she put it on. My mom said no and started whining. My wife accused her of not loving her son/grandson and it became a power struggle. People (not my mom) started yelling at my wife. it was awful. 

I told my wife to leave her alone and said my mom could put it on or leave, but leaving is a perfectly valid option. My wife just gave me a death stare. My mom said she would leave and thanked me for being reasonable which I see was a dig on her part. Eventually my dad gave her a suit jacket and I thought everything was fine, but my wife was furious after the fact and said I sided with my mom and let her ruin our son's christening. She said I'm a coward and should have demanded she put that sweater on, and it is ridiculous that she cared more about the sweater than her family. she said I undermined and embarrassed her in front of everyone, and my mom deserved to be yelled at.",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for defending my mom to my wife and allowing her to ""ruin"" my son's christening?","My mom and my wife have never had a great relationship.

We live about a seven hour plane ride away from my mom and there hasn't been a single visit in five years. My wife and my mom never had a great relationship. It wasn't too terrible but just very different people and they get on each other's nerves, so my wife doesn't want her to stay in the house. 

It makes me sad but my wife feels the home needs to be a sanctuary and no one who upsets her should be allowed to stay in her sanctuary, and I chose to support that. Her ideal visit would be my mom staying at a hotel and having designated visiting times.

145,AITA for telling my dad that I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives me back my college fund as a christmas gift?,"
To make this brief. I M23 had issues with my dad after my mom died and my stepmom came along. I hated a lot of decisions that were made, but what has left a long lasting impact was taking my college fund to pay for my stepbrother's surgeries. Unfortunately, he's dead (died last year at the age of 16 from a chronic heart problem). I put my distance but still see my grandparents and uncles, aunts, cousins etc.


With the holiday season coming up, dad started talking to me through some relatives - close relatives. He went on about his overwhelming feelings of lonliness, his upcoming divorce and invited me to spend christmas with him because he's alone and heartbroken. As a response, I told him I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives back my college fund in a form of a christmas gift. He and the others didn't like my response. He thought this was harsh and my relatives said that I was a judgemental, petty, greedy asshole to say this to him after he's lost so much. They said he did all he could to save his stepson (my stepbrother) life which they described as ""noble"" and that he doesn't owe me a thing. I went home after a big argument with my uncle who came at me for what I said.


Now I feel like shit. Maybe I should've just calmly, politely declined the invite and not said this to him and made him feel guilty for how he handled my stepbrother's situation.


EDIT I just took a look and I see that I'm getting a shitload of comments here. To answer few questions:

1_the fund was made by my dad, mom was a sahm and didn't work but they both agreed that this fund would go towards my educatiotion. 2_I was able to get in college, I started working to pay my way and had some relatives help but my uncle did so much for me which is why I said felt like shit when he berated me. He holds a special place in my life and he's the last person I want to disppoint or let down.


EDIT2 Okay for those who are saying the fund wasn't mine. Whose fund was it then? LMFAO I really don't get this maybe you can expand on how exactly the fund wasn't mine and to whom it belonged? Also, for those that think that I'm being cruel to my dad after he lost so much. I try not to go out of my way to be mean or malicious. Matter of fact, I want little to nothing to do with him but all this time I been playing nice to please my uncle and relatives but that's it.",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for telling my dad that I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives me back my college fund as a christmas gift?","

146,AITA for telling on my coworker and getting him fired ?,"Just a quick backstory, I 27M work as a private banker. We are short staffed and if anyone is out, it affects everyone and everything. 

I was scheduled to go on vacation yesterday through Monday. On Tuesday, my coworker told me he was not feeling good so I told him to go see the doctor. He told me he had a headache and runny nose.

He ended up taking the rest of the week off, with this happening, I knew my coworkers would struggle badly so I took it upon myself to cancel one of my vacation days and help out. Nobody asked me to do this, I did it myself due to my boss helping me out and being an overall great boss. 

I was pretty upset at my coworker because while he did seem sick, I feel he was faking the severity. While on my break, I see him get tagged on a Facebook post that he's at the beach. He's smiling and next to his girlfriend. 

I immediately take a screenshot and send him a message asking if he's really at the beach, he replies and says yes, not to say anything but that he was out of personal time. 

I tell him that I canceled one of my days because he was ""sick"". He doesn't respond so I send the screenshot to my boss.

149,"AITA for ""tricking"" my SIL into trying keto?","I (28F) have been keto for the last two years. I tried it because I was always feeling bloated and crappy after eating and was struggling to lose weight.

Keto really helped with my IBS and other gastro symptoms and I've lost some weight and am keeping it off.

My brother (25M) married my SIL(24F) last year. SIL and I have always been cordial and she's a nice lady but we haven't gotten close yet.

I'm really close to my brother so I see him often and usually have lunch or dinner together at least once a week. 

SIL eats a ton of fast food and pasta and generally unhealthy stuff, but works out a lot so manages to stay thin. She doesn't have the most mature palate but bro is pretty open minded and had tried and liked keto food with me.

She and my brother know I'm keto and SIL sometimes makes fun of me for it and tells me I should just 'eat some pasta' a lot and just work out like she does. Usually it's just a few joking sort of comments every now and then and she's not rude about it so I've let it slide. 

Yesterday i invited her and brother to my place for dinner.

I asked him and SIL if they had any preferences or ideas for what to have for dinner. 
My brother said anything was fine and they were excited for my cooking.

I made a tasty keto meal, and tried to make stuff I thought SIL would like too. I did bacon wrapped sausages as a main, one of my favorites, and then a side of cauliflower rice with broccoli and bacon.

They came over and my SIL was acting a little strange as I brought out the food and asked ""jokingly"" where the bread was but everything was going fine.

We were partway thru the meal when my brother asked what everything was. I told them and my SIL  got upset, saying that I tricked them with ""fake rice"", and that I was being sneaky and unreasonable and trying to force keto on her.

She refused to eat with us after that and ordered some fast food takeout. I was a little offended and then I suggested to my brother afterwards that maybe we could just do a meal the two of us and SIL overheard and accused me of trying to force others to do keto and leaving her out, and why couldn't I just make real rice or pasta like a ""normal person"" and that I should have known better than to make my ""weird food"" for other people.

So sanity check here, AITA??",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for ""tricking"" my SIL into trying keto?","I (28F) have been keto for the last two years. I tried it because I was always feeling bloated and crappy after eating and was struggling to lose weight.

Keto really helped with my IBS and other gastro symptoms and I've lost some weight and am keeping it off.

My brother (25M) married my SIL(24F) last year. SIL and I have always been cordial and she's a nice lady but we haven't gotten close yet.

I'm really close to my brother so I see him often and usually have lunch or dinner together at least once a week. 

SIL eats a ton of fast food and pasta and generally unhealthy stuff, but works out a lot so manages to stay thin. She doesn't have the most mature palate but bro is pretty open minded and had tried and liked keto food with me.

She and my brother know I'm keto and SIL sometimes makes fun of me for it and tells me I should just 'eat some pasta' a lot and just work out like she does. Usually it's just a few joking sort of comments every now and then and she's not rude about it so I've let it slide. 

Yesterday i invited her and brother to my place for dinner.

150,AITA for telling my wife why I was upset on her birthday?,"Today was my wife’s (Anna) birthday and we were hanging out with some family, including my brother(David)/his fiancée (Alice), and my wife’s aunt Rachel and little cousin Katie.

As some backstory, Anna suggested that for Christmas, we would get Katie an “experience” as a gift; basically tickets to something she wanted to do. I said, sure, whatever. We cleared it with Rachel who said yes.

Back to this evening. As we we were eating, Anna told Katie, to “tell (me) what he’s doing in a couple of months.” “What?” I asked. I was told that we were taking her to see Hairspray. I was upset (bc I know how expensive shows are and Anna didn't discuss that as an option with me) but didn't say anything. 

Later, Anna made some comment about she’s not drinking right now. Kinda outta the blue. 

As some more backstory, we are trying to have kids. She’s told 4 groups of people so far: her parents, my best friend, one of her friends and her best friend. At no point has she asked me if I feel comfortable with her telling everyone, and quite honestly every time she does it, she can tell it makes me uncomfortable. She’s even made comments about how embarrassed I look a few of the times. I’ve also expressed discomfort at telling people at least once, but she continues to do so. IMO, having kids is a deeply personal choice, and so is the decision about whether or not to tell people you are. I feel as though she’s robbed me of having any input in the second decision.

So when she made that comment in front of my family, I was upset about this too bc I know she wanted them to ask why so she could tell them. Luckily for me, David and Alice were oblivious.

Another thing was that after Katie and Rachel left, she made a comment about how she was going to use Katie to drag me to more musicals (I loathe musicals, Anna loves them).

After I finished buying the tickets, she could tell I was upset and asked me why. I explained it to her. She immediately got defensive. From her point of view, we only spent $35 on Katie. I explained to her that no, we essentially spent $150 on Katie because we wouldn’t be buying Hairspray tickets for ourselves if it wasn’t Katie’s gift. Her argument for telling people about us trying to have kids without talking to me first is that “it’s her body.” Sure, that’s true, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that having kids and telling people you are trying are both deeply personal decisions and she didn’t factor my comfort level into the decision to broadcast it.

Me (16f) and my mon had a huge argument for context my mom is an extrovert an I'm really introverted .I'm also  the first daughter of a black family do with that what you will. My mom puts alot of pressure on me to live up to her expectations I'm a straight A student and I have a lot of expectations outside school (being captain of the volleyball team, managing my siblings etc).

 Honestly I'm starting to snap mentally I have a lot on my plate and I'm trying to keep up and my mom is constantly adding more responsibilities and expectations that are starting to stress me out to the point where one of my teachers even called her phone and told her I'm starting to look depressed in my classes (ps I've been known for struggling with depression  but my mother doesn't believe in ""mental health""). 

So she confronted me about it and I was honest which isn't something I normally do (i always say im fine ).I told her I'm stressed and she's been putting alot on my plate.  Long story short she blew up and told me I'm too young to feel stressed and I have no real world problems. I broke down and cried and she continued to belittle me even more about how I'm weak and I'm too spoiled and if I really was stressed I would have talked to her about it instead of sitting in my room all day .That's when I said why would I want to talk to her  or even be around her  when she doesn't listen to me . Apparently this struck a nerve and she's going around telling family members how I told her that I don't like being around her it's the truth I don't . I said it to her face. 

I Have a love hate relationship with my mom and non with my dad I'm the black sheep on both sides of the family . Everyone is telling me to apologize and stop being a bitch but I don't feel bad she pushed me and responded honestly.

154,WIBTA if I didn’t get my daughter a 30th birthday present?,"I (F55) have recently gone no contact with my daughter (F29). I have supported her both financially and emotionally for the last decade, while she was raising my grandchildren (F9 & M6). 

This routine started so that she could go to work on weekends for some extra money. I still work full time, so had to fit my rota around her needs and use all my weekend/annual leave up when she requested it. I would be in her flat Friday-Sunday with the kids, do her housework, pay for her groceries or take out when she got home. I was unable to spend any quality time with my other children or grandchild because all my time was spent supporting her. 

When she quit her job, she requested I still continue my weekends with the children so that she could have a break from them (she says this in front of them, they know mummy doesn’t want to be around them). I had been doing this up until a few months ago, and been trying my hardest to ensure the kids know that they are so very loved.

We went no contact after an argument where she weaponised the kids, and threatened to stop me seeing them. As I’ve been a huge part of those kids lives, and I know my daughters parenting style is damaging, I spoke to a solicitor to discuss my visitation rights as a grandparent. They confirmed my chances are high, and we started the first step of mediation. 

My daughter flat out refused to sit in the same room as me, and made the mediators walk up and down the corridor bringing messages instead. A visitation agreement has been reached and I will be seeing my grandchildren again starting next month (I’m so happy this outcome has been reached!). 

Now onto the question:

Its her 30th birthday next week, and she has apparently made comments to her father (my ex husband) that she is upset that she will be spending her 30th alone. My other 2 children and her father do not want to spend it with her either, which I think speaks volumes for our family dynamics. 

I do not want to buy her a present or send a card. I feel that she has made it clear that we are no longer mother and daughter. However, I can’t help but think maybe as I am still her parent, I should be the bigger person? Everyone I’ve spoken to says not to, but I’m conflicted.

I (25M) started a new retail job a few months ago because I'm trying to leave my other retail job that has a very homophobic and abusive environment. My new job has 2 managers. Store manager (40 something F) and warehouse manager (40 something M). (Context: Store manager & warehouse manager are sleeping together. I know this because store manager told me and showed me texts of dirty talk between the two of them. She's a friend of the family so we're close-ish) 

Warehouse manager called me last week on my day off due to a workplace emergency. (Our store manager had just found out that our store was unintentionally selling recalled products). They needed my help immediately removing the product from the shelves (2 aisles worth). The thing is, I had 2 appointments that were non negotiable that day. I had a phone consultation with my doctor about getting me into therapy, and I had to accompany my grandmother to her doctor's appointment because she gets very nervous going to these things alone. 

He said fine and I thought that was the end of it. I go in for my next shift and he immediately lays into me about ""not keeping my word that I would come in whenever they need me"" (I did say I would come in if they needed me, as long as they gave me at least 3 days notice. I made this very clear in the beginning, and as I stated above that my plans could not be canceled when he called me) He also threatened to take away the hours he was giving me because I ""apparently didn't need them"". I told him I didn't need anything from him and reminded him that it was the store manager who handed out hours. He left immediately afterwards. 

I then spoke to store manager, told her everything that happened, and told her to tell warehouse manager to never call or text me again because he isn't my boss, she is. She said she would talk to him but I doubt it will go my way because as I said before, they are sleeping together. 

I have decided that if it continues on my next shift with that manager, then I would give him 1 warning with the threat of quitting, after that and I'm going to quit and leave them high and dry. I am trying to leave 1 abusive job, I don't need another. 

So here's why I might be TAH: 
-Gonna quit if it continues 
-They will be left very short on staff (it's a very small store)

Now I start to feel the need to sleep alone again… or AITA for wanting to “kick her out?” :( I feel guilty about her not being comfortable sleeping in her old room. Also, part of me still wants to share the bed with her since I still want to cherish spending time with her, knowing I might regret not doing so in the future. But then there’s part of me that wants my privacy… What should I do?


Edit: One compromise I’ve always thought about is letting her sleep on some days, then having the room to myself on some days. But would it be difficult for her if she keeps going back and forth her room and mine?"
157,AITA for telling my grandpa he shouldn’t be so sensitive?,My oldest sister was getting married this weekend in the city she lives. I was in charge of picking up the wedding parties suits. My grandpa who I’m not close to decides to go with me to inspect the suits. No biggie. We get there and it’s busy. I guess the local high school homecoming weekend. My grandpa insisted to go through each suit individually and inspect it. Then he goes off on the worker on how the tie is and told her to retie all of the ties on the hanger. She’s young maybe 16 and my grandpa is being an absolute ass to her. She leaves in tears and my grandpa said teens today are to “sensitive.” Another worker comes out and says we can either take the suits as is and leave or not take them because no one is redoing the ties. It’s either leave now with the suits or complain and leave without them and the store will be calling the police on my grandpa for harassment and trespassing. My grandpa is upset but goes without further incident. He’s in the car complaining about how he was treated and he’s going to complain and get everyone fired and free suit rentals for everyone. I finally had enough and said “come on old man stop being so sensitive”  I dropped him off at the hotel not saying another world and I’m calling my sister about how he almost made the wedding party not have their suits. My dad is angry that I talked to my grandpa like that but I just blew him off saying actions have consequences. My sister basically ignored my grandpa after the incident on her wedding day and now grandpa thinks everyone is being mean to him. My dad thinks I shouldn’t have bothered my sister about what happened but I didn’t see any reason not to tell her because he can’t be trusted with a minor task because of how crappy he treats everyone.,NTA,"Judgement: NTA, Title: AITA for telling my grandpa he shouldn’t be so sensitive?",My oldest sister was getting married this weekend in the city she lives.

158,AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos at a wedding?,"I (34f) was asked by my best friend ‘Tina’ (36f) to be the MOH at her wedding. I happily accepted and we’ve been planning ever since.

I have tattoos covering both of my arms, my chest and partially my neck. I asked her before bridesmaid dress shopping if we needed to consider them being covered due to some members of the Groom’s family being fairly conservative people. Tina said that it wasn’t an issue and we decided on a dress that covered my upper arms but had my chest and lower arm tattoos visible.

Cut to the morning of the wedding and as we are getting ready, a lady with a makeup kit walked in. We hadn’t booked an MUA but it turns out that Tina’s MIL had - specifically one that catered to body makeup. She had booked an MUA to cover my tattoos.

A few weeks before the wedding, Tina showed her a photo of me in the bridesmaid dress and she booked the MUA later that evening. Her reasoning was that I would ruin the photos and also upset the Groom’s Grandmother. 

I declined the offer and Tina stood by my decision

Tina was upset and was apologising to the MUA for wasting her time whilst her mother-in-law tore me to shreds about being disrespectful to her wishes. She left and we decided to move on and try and enjoy the rest of the morning before the wedding.

An hour later, the groom showed up at the hotel room. He screamed at me for not caring enough about his Mom and called me an asshole for letting his Mom waste $400 on the MUA.

159,AITA for refusing to take care of the bird my friend got me as a gift?,"I (20F)  lost my baby bird (cockatiel) around 2 weeks ago, I was devastated and im still trying to heal because I loved him and cared for him alot, i also spoiled him and basically treated him like he was my own child, he was so sweet and gentle and just writing about him now makes me cry. Alot of friends and family offered to get me any pet I want but I firmly refused, with the excuse that Ill never be able to care for another pet and that my wound is still hurting, any pet would feel like a replacement.


Today my friend ""surprised"" me with a beautiful cockatiel, he was so sweet and curious (the bird). I immediately told the friend that I appreciated all of this but please take him because im not ready emotionally to care for him, he told me that its ok and to just let him in my house for a day or two and that he'll take him after, i didn't say no or yes, just picked the bird up and went to give him some new food and water and gave him some of buck's toys (my bird), he was content. 

After about 2 hours, the guilt started to grow more than I can handle, i felt like my feelings were a joke to said friend especially when I told him that I can't take responsibility for the bird and he said that im being over dramatic. He told me I was an a hole for not accepting his gift and that this bird is innocent and don't deserve my cruel judgment, and that being this hung up won't return bucky.

I feel really guilty because on one hand, the new birdie deserves to be loved and well taken care of and on the hand every time I look at him I remember my birdie and im unable to heal. I gave him all of buck's toys and treats and food and even a bigger cage but I still told my friend to take him.

But because of her Social Anxiety, she never attended school much, absent for weeks. Tbh I have never seen her since I befriended her on the first day…in school that is. She would invite me and two of my friends to hang out constantly. We tried to get her to warm up to school, made plans to get her excited about what we could do in school together, but always on the next day, there’s only a text message “sry don’t feel like school today Imao”.

I slowly realised that she never tried to care about her study at all, so I decided I should focus on myself instead of trying to persuade a rock. Because our mocks were coming, every weekend was dedicated to revision. But that did not stop her from asking us to hang out. We tried our best to decline as nice and as possible, she would talk about how lonely she is, and how the school is “abusing us”. Depressed, sad, “literally crying rn”…she pulled out every card on us. And every conversation ended like we finished a marathon, trying to protect this fragile egg any sort of negativity.

I responded that the world doesn’t revolve around her, we all have problems, and now I’m at a crucial time to face mine, so please leave me alone.

I ignored her messages ever since then, not needing anymore distractions. We’re about a week into our mocks, heard that she has been telling our two mutual friends that I was a horrible person. (Although they ignored her hang out invite too)

161,AITA for running away from church and how I talked to my parents afterwards?,"throwaway, and I'll try to keep this short.

I am 14. About a year ago, I told my LDS parents I'm an atheist, and they told me that they were going to let me choose and they will respect my choice but they aren't going to let me lose my faith. I thought that was completely stupid and contradictory, but I didn't say anything then. For the past year, they have been making me go to church with them. 

Yesterday, I had enough. I asked if I could go to the bathroom, and then just walked home. Eventually, they realized I was gone and called me. I picked up, told them I went home, then hung up. They came home and started ranting about how they had been accepting of me and this was too much and stuff like that. I stopped them and told them that they had NOT been accepting of my beliefs since they still force me to come to church with them.

Ngl we both thought she’d be getting fired. They were understaffed fortunately so mostly she just lost a source for recommendations. Obviously she teaches at a different school now 

Here’s where I might be TA - I had a hard time sleeping last night and noticed her phone screen was on. Sometimes she listens to YouTube stuff so it’s not unusual, but I knew that wasn’t the case last night. I guess I mostly just thought it was plugged in.

165,AITA For Overreacting After Catching My Husband Lying?,"My husband is a good person to his core, always patient, loving, forgiving, and kind. His family? Not so much. I have a really strained relationship with his brother who has been really disrespectful to both me and my husband in the past (despite that fact that we paid his entire college tuition, boarding, meals, etc.) We’ve been trying to work on mending our familial relationships in couple’s counselling and have agreed to be clear about our feelings and respect each other’s boundaries. 

A few days ago my husband told me he was going to call to check in on his brother who was tripping at the time. I was curious how he got any LSD since it’s difficult to find here. He told me he had given him one of my plugs (who has never had LSD before mind you). I figure since I haven’t bought in a while, it might be true and moved on. 

Yesterday, I do not know what possessed me but I decided to look through his phone (I have literally never done this before). To my surprise, I saw that he had went through my stash and met his brother nearby and given him LSD. Now, I’m not mad about what he did. I wouldn’t even be that mad if he has hid what he did. But I am furious that he intentionally lied to me. And as I said before my husband is a literal angel, I honestly didn’t even believe he would be capable of lying so easily. When I confront him he doesn’t see any issue with what he did, he claims I would be upset if he had asked me permission. I asked if he thought lying to me wouldn’t make me upset, and he just began giving me the silent treatment. 

At this point I got so pissed that I went to my stash and flushed everything. I know this was probably stupid but I was just so angry and honestly I procured and purchased these items so it doesn’t really matter what I choose to do with them. But I do acknowledge that this was dramatic and am not proud of my reaction.   

It’s been two days since he’s spoken to me and we aren’t seeing our counsellor for another few days. I know my reaction was unnecessary but I don’t feel I deserve to be the asshole for catching him in a lie. So reddit, AITA?

TLDR: My husband lied to me about stealing drugs and giving them to his brother. I found out while going through his phone and out of spite disposed of all my drugs. He is now not speaking to me.

Update: My husband has now removed my face ID from his phone and changed his password to prevent me from looking at anything else he has. I am now developing serious trust issues.",NTA,"Judgement: NTA, Title: AITA For Overreacting After Catching My Husband Lying?","My husband is a good person to his core, always patient, loving, forgiving, and kind. His family? Not so much. I have a really strained relationship with his brother who has been really disrespectful to both me and my husband in the past (despite that fact that we paid his entire college tuition, boarding, meals, etc.) We’ve been trying to work on mending our familial relationships in couple’s counselling and have agreed to be clear about our feelings and respect each other’s boundaries. 

A few days ago my husband told me he was going to call to check in on his brother who was tripping at the time. I was curious how he got any LSD since it’s difficult to find here. He told me he had given him one of my plugs (who has never had LSD before mind you). I figure since I haven’t bought in a while, it might be true and moved on. 

Yesterday, I do not know what possessed me but I decided to look through his phone (I have literally never done this before). To my surprise, I saw that he had went through my stash and met his brother nearby and given him LSD. Now, I’m not mad about what he did. I wouldn’t even be that mad if he has hid what he did. But I am furious that he intentionally lied to me. And as I said before my husband is a literal angel, I honestly didn’t even believe he would be capable of lying so easily. When I confront him he doesn’t see any issue with what he did, he claims I would be upset if he had asked me permission. I asked if he thought lying to me wouldn’t make me upset, and he just began giving me the silent treatment. 

At this point I got so pissed that I went to my stash and flushed everything. I know this was probably stupid but I was just so angry and honestly I procured and purchased these items so it doesn’t really matter what I choose to do with them. But I do acknowledge that this was dramatic and am not proud of my reaction.   

It’s been two days since he’s spoken to me and we aren’t seeing our counsellor for another few days. I know my reaction was unnecessary but I don’t feel I deserve to be the asshole for catching him in a lie. So reddit, AITA?

166,WIBTA if I didn't allow a PTSD service dog at my wedding?,"Throwaway account.

I'm 19 and nonbinary, my partner is 20 and nonbinary. My aunt is 40ishF. Same with my mother.

Backstory:
My aunt has a PTSD service dog. I have no idea how it passed the service dog test because every time I am out with her it causes chaos. Destroying store displays, getting into altercations with other dogs, barking, etc.

My mother is SEVERELY allergic to the dog - every time she's around the dog, her throat starts closing up. She also gets severe allergy symptoms (itchy eyes, runny nose, hives, etc). She CANNOT be around this dog. My aunt refuses to acknowledge this, and continuously stands in close proximity to my mother with her service dog.

So, I'm starting to figure out the guest list for my wedding. I'd love for my aunt to be there (potentially even in my wedding party!), but I have never seen her attend an event with her dog without there being absolute chaos. The dog is loud, messy, and constantly getting into things. My aunt does NOT keep the dog under control, especially at family events (which is what she'd consider my wedding). She also refuses to keep the dog away from my mother, despite being told that if my mom has too much contact with the dog she could literally go into anaphylaxis and DIE. 

As well, it's small, but my partner is also allergic to the dog - not to the extent that my mother is, but still enough that even with allergy meds they still feel icky.

My partner and I are in agreement that the service dog cannot come to our wedding. We're willing to make as many accommodations as possible to make my aunt comfortable at the wedding (setting aside a quiet space for her, reserving a seat for her, etc) but she has shown time and time again that she cannot control her dog and be considerate of my mother's health issues. And when it comes down to it, if I have to choose between having my mother at my wedding and having my aunt at my wedding, I'm going to choose my mother.

WIBTA if I don't let her bring her service dog?


Edit: some important info I forgot to include (oops!). I'm not in the US. Where I am (BC, Canada) we have a way to get government certified service animals - they have to either be trained by a professional trainer, or undergo a public safety test. My aunt's dog did the latter, so it is a government certified service animal, not an ESA. She just chooses not to enforce the training.",NTA,"Judgement: NTA, Title: WIBTA if I didn't allow a PTSD service dog at my wedding?","Throwaway account.

167,"AITA for ""jumping"" the queue and ""stealing"" the last piece of brownie?","That is seriously dumb, but some of my friends/family believe I was an asshole in the situation, so here we go.

I(30f) moved to the UK about 15 years ago along with my family. Have been living together and dating my bf Nick for 3 years, who was born and raised in the UK. He is also familiar of any of my quirks.

On Sunday I wasn't feeling well. I was sick in the morning, just started my period, which are incredibly painful so I can barely move and to add we run out of any painkillers. I decided to pop to the nearest shop and Nick decided to go to the nearest coffee shop hoping to cheer me up with my favourite drink. The queue was massive and by the time I have finished in the shop, Nick was the next person in the queue.

As he was the next person to make the order (the barista was still serving the person in front) I have asked Nick if he can get me a savoury croissant and a brownie too, which he was okay with. I haven't been to this coffeeshop for a while and really missed their brownies.

After placing the order, Nick moved towards the waiting area and the family next in line has also tried to order the brownie for her child (possibly 7-8?

He ended up trying to take more and I told him I could only give him one for free, so he just took the free one. After that, I walked away from the front desk and he came back and ended up taking five more. He had done it at least five times before and he’s stolen at least $100 of product from us over time. My boss usually calls the police, but I don’t know what ends up becoming of that. I’m not sure why we haven’t banned him yet but I guess they don’t wanna do that. 

The other day he came in wanting to buy 50 papers (yes, 50) since his relative owns a business and he wanted to provide the papers to customers. We thought about giving him a discount, but then decided against it because of his patterns.

I gave him the total and he said he forgot his wallet in his car so he would run out and get it.

I always make room for those awkward situations when traffic is stopped and someone is trying to turn into the road. The only thing I can figure is triggering people is my cargo rack. 

Am I the asshole for keeping it on 24/7? 

 I use it alot to move stuff and help friends out with large loads because U-Haul gets pricey. So it's not like it doesn't get used.

No controversial bumper stickers or writing on my vehicle.

Nothing hanging or dangling

Always follow the speed limit or flow of traffic, though I avoid going 5 over on city streets, 10 on highway. I only go under if im hauling a full load or have a tip hazard on my roof rack. Hazard lights are used in those cases.

I compensate as though I'm pulling a trailer to avoid close calls.

172,AITA for not wanting to bring my autistic friend to a concert.,"I know how the title sounds but let me explain.
We are all under 18 so you understand the amount of maturity.

My best friend, let’s call her Katy, has an autistic girlfriend(Miles). Because Katy is my best friend, I am also friends with Miles. We don’t have a lot in common but we both like the same band. 

Recently me and my other good friend (Jenna) found out that the band is playing in our country, so we really wanted to get some tickets. Me and Jenna have been friends for ages and both adore and discovered the band together so it was always logical that we would go together. 

Now the problem is that Miles kind of pushed on me that she wanted to join me and Jenna for the concert. Miles has difficulty with crowd and loud noises which make her very uncomfortable and anxious. 

This would be fine but the band is well known for having fans faint because of heat and/or noise, so Miles would be extremely uncomfortable the whole time she was there. 

I know that she gonna feel like shit at the concert and that there is a big chance she will want to leave but I don’t want to be responsible for her. I want to have a good time with Jenna at a band that is very close to our hearts without having to worry that Miles is gonna have a breakdown. 

The tickets for the concert and train are gonna be expensive so we really want to make it count.
Also, Jenna and Miles aren’t friends so I would be ruining Jenna’s night too.

173,AITA letting my daughter stay with me during their father's week,"I (F44) have been divorced for 14 years. Ex and I split custody 50/50

My daughter (17F) has been having a rough time lately, which landed her in hospital for mental health problems. After the hospital stay say she asked to stay with me for a little bit as she finds the weekly switches too stressful. I did propose to switch on a bi-weekly or on a monthly basis, but she refused, stating that  2 weeks at her dad's is too long.

Since her hospital stay she's only been to her dad's once, and she had a hard time there. Her father has very little empathy (not out of ill will, he just cannot understand other peoples emotions or how his words and actions affect others), and he does not understand her mental health issues. In his view, what he does not see does not exist, so he is questioning her (medically diagnosed and currently being managed in therapy) issues, which adds to my daughter's stress enormously.

Ex and I split custody 50/50

My daughter (17F) has been having a rough time lately, which landed her in hospital for mental health problems. After the hospital stay say she asked to stay with me for a little bit as she finds the weekly switches too stressful. I did propose to switch on a bi-weekly or on a monthly basis, but she refused, stating that  2 weeks at her dad's is too long.

Since her hospital stay she's only been to her dad's once, and she had a hard time there. Her father has very little empathy (not out of ill will, he just cannot understand other peoples emotions or how his words and actions affect others), and he does not understand her mental health issues. In his view, what he does not see does not exist, so he is questioning her (medically diagnosed and currently being managed in therapy) issues, which adds to my daughter's stress enormously. He is also upset that her grades are down from last year, even though school has confirmed us that this isn't an issue.

174,AITA for wanting my bf to get a job?,"So my (f23) boyfriend (m27) has been unemployed for months now. I work remotely and the plan was that after he lost his previous job (around March/April) he would find a remote job too so we could work and travel abroad.

He applied to some places but they either did not respond or he did not pass the test. I have been looking for options for him too but either he is not interested or says he is not suitable for them. I agree that sometimes it can be the case but he has done nothing to gain new/more valuable skills either that could help getting more replies. There have been times where I have to constantly remind him to send his resume to places as he says he would do it and then forgets. Lately I've been feeling very upset about this and the relationship in general and I said that I do not care at this point and that he could apply for jobs that would requiere working locally, which would also requiere for us to move to a bigger city where you can find a job much easier.

175,AITA for not telling my gf (20 F) that there was roadworks,"TLDR: GF went mental at me since i never mentioned there was roadworks blocking the normal route to my house. The detour was very small and not hard but she wasn’t used to that and blames me for all the abuse and stress it then caused her to have.

The title sounds insane right..? well i need to know if i (21 M) was an asshole as she said i was.

So we planned to go to a drive in movie which was in the next town. My gf passed her driving test a month or so ago so i guess she’s still new to driving but she’s driven around big busy cities and on motorways already so she is confident. 

Anyways, at the bottom of my road they are doing road works and completely blocked off the normal route to my house. This happens to be the main route she knows to mine and somehow the only one even though she has been in my town loads. The detour is super small and not hard. Essentially she came to these road works and then had a nightmare trying to get to mine due to them (driving up wrong way up roads and bus lanes and apparently some man having a go at her) 

She did make it to mine though, but was clearly distressed and upset. She immediately went mental and i mean mental at me. Saying i should have told her there was roadworks and that all this is my fault. In my head i was like wtf - i’ve planned this whole day, ive just got in the car and she’s going mental already. i was a bit taken back but i said sorry and accepted it and tried to reassure her.

She remained to argue and stay in a mood for the next hour and not talk to me (whilst also going mental about how shit the roads are in my town and shouting at me) I understand that she was clearly distressed and said sorry even tho i didn’t think much of the roadworks. My view is that she is an adult and rlly she’s massively overreacted to this.

Edit: I also even offered to drive to the drive in so she could chill out but this made her more angry.

My boyfriend has had his fair share of trauma and has been admitted to hospital for various reasons. 

He has always been honest and open about how he feels and the things that bother him. A few months ago my BFs mother called the police on him and accused him of abusing her. 

He admits that they have had verbal fights and he always tries to walk away but she pushes him into walls and pushes until he reacts. Their last fight had been messy. His mother had been walking into the road and shouting for help while he locked himself in his room and started packing up his stuff with the intention of leaving as it was his last straw. 

The police came and she turned around staying that she did not make the call and she did not want him arrested and then said that she wanted him out the house. (I understand there are things that he might not have told me and that the story is missing gaps) 

After that incident the police left and he left. She is now calling me daily to see how he is doing and trying to get information out of me to stay in his life while he is trying to move on. I feel guilty because I want to help but not Betray my BF by feeding her info about how he is doing when he is trying to move forward with his life. 

SHE ROCKED UP AT MY HOUSE! 
She came unannounced and accused me of lying to her and that I am the cause of her and her sons relationship deteriorating.

179,AITA for not visiting my family because they constantly talk about my weight?,"tw: weight, eating disorder

I'm 26 F from a POC family. I've never gotten along with my family really (other than my brother), in the past they were abusive physically and emotionally but I cut them off for a while and my parents have made efforts to change. I've tried to rekindle things with them too, especially because my grandma just died and I wanted to be supportive of my dad grieving. 

Right now, I'm about 10 pounds overweight. It's the biggest I've ever been in my life. I used to struggle with an eating disorder (my dad doesn't know about this, he doesn't believe in mental illness so there's no point in telling him, I have diagnosed mental illnesses that I take meds for and he shames me and says I should stop taking them) and was about 20 pounds underweight. He'd always tell me to gain weight. After the pandemic and switching from a physical labour job to a wfh office job, I've gained some weight.

I feel like shit about it and I am trying to actively lose it. I joined kickboxing classes and I am cooking. I am working on it. Everytime my dad sees me, he comments on it, saying things like ""even pretty girls get fat"" and talking about how awful I look and how much harder it'll be to lose the weight. I've told him I'm working on it and to please stop commenting on it, but he refuses to stop and KEEPS incessantly telling me the same things. 

Last night, I was having a great night, and then he decided to send a photo of me when I was underweight and tell me that I need to work hard to lose weight and that I should start fasting. He said he was a bad influence for feeding me when I'd visit. He says it's what a good parent would do and that I should take it positively, but I'm relapsing. I tried to get yogurt this morning and I sobbed, I couldn't get it in my mouth.

I'm scared to visit for Thanksgiving and Christmas and to be told constantly how fat I am. I can't take it, especially when I am already putting the work in. When he says things like this, I get so depressed I don't want to even leave the house. I blocked his number and my mom is already guilt tripping me for not responding to him.

181,WIBTA if I moved into my brothers room?,"My brother (19) has moved out and into his own apartment for a while now, though he takes occasional visits for a couples nights back to the house where me (f16) and my mum lives. 

I have always had more stuff than him and have felt like I’ve needed a bigger room for a while now, especially since I have started growing plants and my room is lacking light (unlike my brothers). The problem is that my mother (and most likely my brother too - for various reasons, we don’t get along) is against it and she has told me that I am too messy of a person and that the room is still my brothers regardless of the fact that he’s no longer living with us. 

Though it is true that I am a far more messier person in comparison to my brother, this is in part due to the fact that my room has become a storage room of sorts for old childhood toys. I also do various arts and crafts, and am in need of larger desk space (currently I just sit on the floor), and I have a few books which I’m simply cramming into the small bookshelf I own. In short, I feel that I would be a much more organised person had I actually more space to store my belongings. 

I’ve told this to my mum but she’s taken it that I’m being an asshole to my brother for wanting to switch rooms. So, WIBTA?

Edit: hey thanks for the replies and advice everyone :) I’ve cleaned my room today and got rid of some old and unwanted items, though just for clarification I can’t get rid of all my old toys as my mum says she wants to keep them for memories.

I have always had more stuff than him and have felt like I’ve needed a bigger room for a while now, especially since I have started growing plants and my room is lacking light (unlike my brothers). The problem is that my mother (and most likely my brother too - for various reasons, we don’t get along) is against it and she has told me that I am too messy of a person and that the room is still my brothers regardless of the fact that he’s no longer living with us. 

Though it is true that I am a far more messier person in comparison to my brother, this is in part due to the fact that my room has become a storage room of sorts for old childhood toys. I also do various arts and crafts, and am in need of larger desk space (currently I just sit on the floor), and I have a few books which I’m simply cramming into the small bookshelf I own. In short, I feel that I would be a much more organised person had I actually more space to store my belongings. 

I’ve told this to my mum but she’s taken it that I’m being an asshole to my brother for wanting to switch rooms. So, WIBTA?

Edit: hey thanks for the replies and advice everyone :) I’ve cleaned my room today and got rid of some old and unwanted items, though just for clarification I can’t get rid of all my old toys as my mum says she wants to keep them for memories. I’ve settled for trying to keep my room as neat as possible over the next week or so and also ask my brother for permission. Wish me luck :)"
182,WIBTA if i paid for my sis in law to redo their will and trust?,"Ages: wife's step mom 63. Wife 25. OP 28. Brother in law 31. Sister in law 29. Kids under 5.

My wife's step brother and wife have 2 kids. Both under 5. My wife's step mom paid for them to have a will and trust done, on the condition that she be made beneficiary and guardian. They agreed because they didn't want sis in laws mom to get a hold of the kids.  That woman is a whole kind of crazy.

My brother in law and sis in law have said they want my wife and I to have the kids if anything where to happen to them, because we have been the most involved in their lives and actively try to be a part of their lives; we do weekly calls, sometimes random calls, when we lived closer, 30 min distance, my wife and I would ask to take the kids over the weekend at least twice a month. We have since moved 3 hours away, and we still manage to see the kids every 3 months for a weekend visit.

My wife's step mom is controlling and very manipulative to everyone. The step mom doesn't like me because I don't just do what she says and keeps trying to get involved in my wife's and Is finances. The step mom doesn't like that we have cats. Or that both my wife and I occasionally drink alcohol. Step mom thinks I'm an alcoholic because on my wife's and Is wedding I had 4 beers, over the course of 6 hours.

My sister in law and I are close. She doesn't like her mom in law, she doesn't want her to have the kids if something happens to them. And she really wants to get the will and trust redone and take her mom in law off of it. I could just give them the money and they can do whatever.

But I'm worried if it got out that I paid for it, my wife's step mom would try to flip it and act like I'm being manipulative and controlling. My sis in law has a hard time not saying stuff so I know it would get out. But also I don't think it's fair that wife's step mom manipulated them into naming her.

Brother in law has also stated that he doesn't want his mom as guardian. He has told my wife that he wants my wife to be guardian.

183,AITA for blocking my girlfriend's bff for making a joke?,"I (14NB) and my girlfriend (15F) have been together for a few months now. We met in middle school and started dating late September this year. My girlfriend's BFF (14F), let's call her Kelly, made a joke a few days ago commenting on one of our friend's aviator glasses saying it made them look like Jefferey Dahmer. (I think you already know where this is going.)

I spoke up, said that we shouldn't make those jokes because they're insensitive to the victims and their families, and that I already see enough people on tiktok ""cosplaying"" him and it's annoying. Kelly replies with ""I'd cosplay him too. Just give me a wig and glasses and I'm good to go."" I got upset and berated her, but she didn't care.

I then moved away from the group and brought up all my apps I had her added on and blocked her on everything but Snapchat because it was the only way to talk to my GF when I wasn't at school as she didn't have a phone herself. Nonetheless, the topic was broguht up recently when my GF needed me to tell Kelly and her partner that we wouldnt be able to walk with them to the bus ramp as my GF needed to grab something from her chorus class.

I had handed her my phone and she went to text Kelly on Discord but realized Kelly had been blocked. She asked me about it and I told her. My GF asked me if I was going to do that everytime someone made a joke that upset me and push everyone away that easily. I didn't know how to respond so I stuttered. She asked me what would happen if it was her that made the joke, would I break up with her? Push her away?

I got anxious as I really love her and try not to think about anxiety inducing things like that. I told her honestly that she was different, but if she made an insensitive joke like that, I would get annoyed too. She got awkwardly silent and I don't know if I should just unblock Kelly or stand my ground.

We see my aunt maybe twice per year (I'm 32), we basically have no relationship other than her commenting on stuff on Facebook (I post maybe 8x per year?).

186,AITA for joining in at my roommate’s gf’s birthday at our place?,"I went out on Friday for Halloween and my roommate had told me he was having people over at our place for his gf’s birthday. I thanked him for letting me know and said I’d be out that night and later going to my parents to house sit. 

I went out at 7:30pm, the gf’s party didn’t start until 8pm and when I got back it was midnight, so plenty of time passed. I asked if I could join and they didn’t mind but that may have been out of politeness.

I immediately apologized and excused myself to bed. Everyone continued going for a few hours and I even had to put a towel along the door to muffle the sound and light but it was still very noticeable. 

The next day I packed up my stuff and headed straight to my parents. I’ve had this sickening feeling ever since. I’ve asked a few people and they thought I didn’t do anything wrong, with one person saying that I lived there so it’d be weird if I didn’t join (also I wouldn’t have been able to sleep if it was still that loud) and if it was for her birthday, why wasn’t it at her place (she lives alone)?

Plus she makes a lot of money so that doesn’t hurt either.

We got there a little early, and her job is next door to a Starbucks so we decided to get some breakfast. I flipped off the building (not knowing who was inside or that there was anyone inside) because it was my way of saying “fuck this place, we’re getting food”.

189,AITA for waking up my mom when told to?,"(Sorry if this is poorly written, it's my first time writing a post and I'm on mobile.)

So this just happened a little bit ago, I'm really upset about it because I thought I was doing what I was told, but now my mom doesn't even want to talk to me. 

But here's the story: My mom (34f), me (16f), and my siblings (15f, 16f) just moved back to my hometown because we had stuff lined up there and my father was not the best at all (for context, he cheated on my mom when I was really young and eventually left her for the woman he was dating when she got pregnant).

It was ok for the first couple of weeks, just a few bad things here and there, but this morning just seemed to be the worst one yet. Now I am sort of like my mothers 'alarm clock', I do not enjoy it (for those who might tell me to just stop waking her up, I can't I will get in trouble), each time waking her up is a hassle, I feel like I'm the adult waking up a child.

But today I was told by my sibling to wake her up at 8:30 cause she had to go do some important stuff today, so when that time inevitably rolled around, I went and got up to go wake her up.

So this just happened a little bit ago, I'm really upset about it because I thought I was doing what I was told, but now my mom doesn't even want to talk to me. 

But here's the story: My mom (34f), me (16f), and my siblings (15f, 16f) just moved back to my hometown because we had stuff lined up there and my father was not the best at all (for context, he cheated on my mom when I was really young and eventually left her for the woman he was dating when she got pregnant).

It was ok for the first couple of weeks, just a few bad things here and there, but this morning just seemed to be the worst one yet. Now I am sort of like my mothers 'alarm clock', I do not enjoy it (for those who might tell me to just stop waking her up, I can't I will get in trouble), each time waking her up is a hassle, I feel like I'm the adult waking up a child.

But today I was told by my sibling to wake her up at 8:30 cause she had to go do some important stuff today, so when that time inevitably rolled around, I went and got up to go wake her up. When she finally woke up, she had some back pain cause the mattress we currently use isn't really good, but she got mad at ME. 

I finally got fed up and told her that ""I'm not going to wake you up anymore."" (Which is a lie, I'm going to get in trouble if it don't), she got mad at me for getting frustrated with her and finally got up to start stomping around the house.

190,AITA for not wanting to fix boyfriends car after he fixed mine?,"AITA for not wanting to fix partners car after he fixed mine?

I, 19f have been with my boyfriend, 20m for almost 7 months. He had a job for the first 2 weeks we were together, and then quit because he said it was straining to his mental health. Since then, he has literally put almost no effort into any income at all. 

Since we got together in april, I have spent probably about 6000 dollars on him. I buy almost all his food, I pay for most gas, he’s went on my vacations for free saying he would pay me back, recently I got my first apartment and he has not spent a single dollar helping me pay rent but he’s living here with nothing to offer. 

I bought a new car back in about May because my motor blew up. (Probably due to driving him everywhere and driving him and his friends where ever they wanted to go with no gas money.) He has a car he really loves but about a month after we got together it started having problems (about a 300 dollar fix but he has no money to fix it) 

When I got my car he got pulled over in it the first day and so he said he would put it in his name for court. Ever since then he has drove it everywhere every single time we go anywhere because it’s a manual and he never really thought me how to drive it like he said he would. Since he drives, I figured when it started having little problems that were little to no money to fix, he could spend the little money his family would give him or he did small things for to fix it. He drives it and it’s in his name even though I bought it, seems like it’s only fair, I still paid for all the gas though. 

Yesterday the car got totaled when we were pulled over on the side of the road fixing a small problem someone hydroplaned right into us. Now, he’s a saying the best option for us is for me to pay and fix his car since he spent some money fixing “mine” sometimes. I was absolutely bewildered he asked me this because i’ve been mothering him every day since we started dating and I pay for EVERYTHING else. He always brings the tiny things he pays for up everytime we argue about money even though i’ve spent probably 10x as much money as he has. He guilt trips me so much for this and says i’m the one with actual income coming in and “I have it easier than him.” Aita???",NTA,"Judgement: NTA, Title: AITA for not wanting to fix boyfriends car after he fixed mine?","AITA for not wanting to fix partners car after he fixed mine?

191,AITA for not stopping a toddler from almost crawling off a ledge,"So the toddler is fine and it didn't fall. Just wanted to get that out of the way.

The girlfriends and wives come too. We all bring some food. Pizza, beer, wings etc. It's a good time. A friend of my friend's wife was at our last game day. She had her toddler with her. Usually the kids play together in a room but this one was quite young and she wasn't familiar with all of us yet so she was just keeping the kid with her.

It was pretty high. She then starts to scold me and says that she just went to the bathroom real quick and I should have seen this. I said that she never told me that she'd be away. She just silently left and expected me to be watching. My buddies are on my side but the mother and some of the women aren't. But I also wanted to open this up to a larger topic.

I am 19F, work part-time and live rent free at the moment with my mum, stepdad and sister (16F). I will be going to college at the start of next year. My bio dad very rarely pays child support for me and my sister, and the little he does contribute would not have been enough to feed us for even a week, with both my mum's and his income. Luckily my sister and I were very fortunate to have been raised by not only my mum, but my stepdad, grandmothers, uncles and aunties. Of course he doesn't need to pay anymore child support for me ever since I turned 18, I just want to emphasise how much he's NOT supported me throughout my life. He also lives a 3hr flight away from us. I have not seen him in person for 4 years.

The one thing he has consistently paid for since I was about 16 was my Spotify Premium (and also Youtube Premium since he had some sort of combo deal of the two but I've not been notified of Youtube Premium being cancelled). It was part of a family subscription that he paid for and had me, his partner and a few other non-family on it.

A week ago, I got an email saying that the subscription had been cancelled, so I only have the free version now. It's not the costs that bug me, as I said I work part-time so I can pay for my own, though my stepdad said he wants to pay for it (bless him. Not that this matters too much but I actually call my stepdad dad, and refer to my bio dad by his first name. I have not yet called my bio dad his first name to his face since we very rarely talk). What upsets me is that it was cancelled with no warning from him, it was the only thing that he consistently paid for me.

On the other hand, he's flying to our hometown (which is about an 1½ hour flight away from where I live) at the end of November. He just paid for half of my flight to meet him there, as well as see my paternal grandma, uncle and aunty who just had a baby.

We did some research and found that there were only three stores nearby, the closest one was a adult toy store (if you know what I mean) so we and we didn't really want to got there, but after many failed attempts of going to other places, we decided to suck it up and go. I went in and bought it, at that point I was drooling to get it so I paid 70 of my hard earned bucks. I was happy.

194,AITA for wanting to spend Silvester at my dads?,"So throwaway account, cause idk if my family or friends have Reddit.
This is also my first post ever on Reddit so pls be gentle.
Now onto the question.

Today I(17f) asked my mother D(44f), if I could spend Silvester at my dads M(51m). (They split up when I was very young cause of unknown problems.)
Almost Every year I spent Christmas, Easter, my birthday and other Holidays even Father’s Day at my mom’s. As you may see my mother has primary custody and I see my dad every second week. (To me my dad is my everything and just a massive comfort). Now I can describe my relationship with my mother only as toxic. One day she’s the sweetest woman ever and the other I get blamed for all her problems. She yells at me, hits me and then hours later she apologises.
The problem she has with this situation is that I’m “drifting away from her”. This year I spent my birthday with my dad, because my mom worked ,cause of her job, but hasn’t even first acknowledged that my birthday was that time. I mean I understand she has a new job so I was just a bit hurt, but happy for her I guess. The last weekend I got the offer to spent Silvester at his house with his wife of three years (51f). Today I asked her casually, if I could spent that holiday at his house and she tried to bribe me into staying saying they probably are busy. Then I straight up said I got an invitation and she instantly became more distant. Because I already will spend two days after Christmas at his. She then asked me, if I wanted her to be all alone at the holidays (a week), because she has off at that week and wants me to be there, which I didn’t even know. There was always drama, if I wanted to go to my dad at holidays, but now she’s really cold towards me saying I will distance myself more and more from her in the future, cause I apparently only care about my dad. Which isn’t true in the slightest, because I was there in her depressive stage in life in my early teen years and she didn’t really care when I told her I didn’t wanna be here anymore. I don’t know I feel bad because she’s in the next room ugly sobbing and she just pushed me away when I tried making a compromise.

Sorry if I left anything out, it’s just really overwhelming right now.

196,AITA for feeling set up?,"My parents invited me and my husband to Dauphin island for a 4 day weekend to celebrate my dad’s birthday. When I asked if we needed to secure accommodations, I was told that they rented a house from Friday through Monday and that they had plenty of room for us as there were 3 bedrooms with double beds and one with bunks. 
I haven’t had a good relationship with my two sisters for several years now but I’ve been trying to re-establish some kind of connection.
I was told that my oldest sister was bringing her husband but my younger sister’s husband wouldn’t be attending and that she would be bringing her son’s girlfriend. Because of this, my younger sister had “claimed the room with the bunk beds”.  That was perfect because that meant that my husband and I would have a room with a double bed. 
First off, we were told at the very last minute that we would be checking in on Saturday (not Friday as we were originally told). We had both already taken off work Friday through Monday so we decided that rather than leaving on Thursday night, we would leave on Friday (driving from Illinois) take our time and spend the night somewhere on the way. When we arrived at the rental on Saturday, nobody was there yet.  We tried calling my mom’s cell phone but got no answer. We decided to go get something to eat at a nearby restaurant while we waited to hear from the rest of the party. 
When my mom finally called us it was to tell us that they had arrived at the house and that my younger sister’s husband was able to come after all and that she had decided that they would be taking the room with the double bed and my husband and I would get the room with the bunks since we were the last to arrive. That was also when we were told that everyone was staying until Tuesday. We had to leave on Monday because of our work schedules. 
It turns out that my parents changed the reservation to accommodate my younger sister’s husband’s work schedule but we were made to believe that we had just misunderstood from the beginning.  
When we returned home several extended family members called and texted me asking why my husband and I left early. (Not sure how or why that misinformation traveled so quickly).

When I asked if we needed to secure accommodations, I was told that they rented a house from Friday through Monday and that they had plenty of room for us as there were 3 bedrooms with double beds and one with bunks. 
I haven’t had a good relationship with my two sisters for several years now but I’ve been trying to re-establish some kind of connection.
I was told that my oldest sister was bringing her husband but my younger sister’s husband wouldn’t be attending and that she would be bringing her son’s girlfriend. Because of this, my younger sister had “claimed the room with the bunk beds”.  That was perfect because that meant that my husband and I would have a room with a double bed. 
First off, we were told at the very last minute that we would be checking in on Saturday (not Friday as we were originally told). We had both already taken off work Friday through Monday so we decided that rather than leaving on Thursday night, we would leave on Friday (driving from Illinois) take our time and spend the night somewhere on the way. When we arrived at the rental on Saturday, nobody was there yet.  We tried calling my mom’s cell phone but got no answer. We decided to go get something to eat at a nearby restaurant while we waited to hear from the rest of the party. 
When my mom finally called us it was to tell us that they had arrived at the house and that my younger sister’s husband was able to come after all and that she had decided that they would be taking the room with the double bed and my husband and I would get the room with the bunks since we were the last to arrive. That was also when we were told that everyone was staying until Tuesday. We had to leave on Monday because of our work schedules. 
It turns out that my parents changed the reservation to accommodate my younger sister’s husband’s work schedule but we were made to believe that we had just misunderstood from the beginning.

197,AITAH for not being able to open up to my therapist about my trauma yet?,"So I(18nonbinary) went through one of the most traumatic experiences in my life 4 years ago in my freshman year of high school with a toxic ex bf. I won't go into detail but because of what happened, I've been in and out of therapy for 3 years now. Recently, about 3 or 4 months ago, I got a new therapist (we'll call her Melissa) and she is really sweet and kind.

The problem is I have a very hard time opening to people due to them leaving or dying. An example of this is I had a theater teacher I loved to death my sophomore and Junior year, I'm a senior now, I told her a lot of things and even brought up why I had so many panic attacks during the musical for that year. That was because of trauma. This happened after I got Melissa but she had to leave due to my school treating her like shit and family issues so she moved and I may not see her again...ever probably.

Another example is I opened up to another therapist, before Melissa, about a year ago and was starting to get into the trauma when she vanished off the face of earth without warning and I was left alone thinking I was bad luck and it was all my fault.

So my mom has been pushing me to open up about the trauma like I do with my bf, he kinda knows the situation but not all of it he does know though I'm scared of my ex coming back and manipulating himself into my life again like he's been trying to do before. She's getting mad because in therapy I'm freezing and shutting down when we try to talk, it's a telephone call due to Melissa being in another part of my state and it being a long drive. My moms been with me in therapy because I'm not ready to open up or be alone and need some support until I can get myself to actually talk about the trauma.

But lately she's been giving remarks like ""I wish you had talked more"" one day when everything was so overwhelming I couldn't cope or talk much, or ""I can't do all the talking and you do some"" because I have a hard time trusting Melissa. She's nice but it's hard to believe her when she says she isn't going to leave. I know she wants to help but she's getting mad when I can't talk and just fidget with whatever's in front of me because I can't do it.

My moms getting mad and I feel like I'm doing nothing wrong, but on the other hand I feel like the AH for not being able to talk about the trauma that happened 4 years ago.

198,AITA for abandoning my parents and refusing to give them any money ?,"I (25F) called my parents selfish giants and refused to give them any money .
Context - 
I (25F) live in Germany with my partner (28F) . I come from a country where being gay is illegal . My parents had similar thought and when i came out at 13 , they i had to turn out staight or else the consequences won't be good . Since that day our conversation were minimal & they just gave me the basic education , food and a roof for me to exists  whereas they were always spoiling my elder sister who is 3 years elder than me with luxuries and special surprises. I knew the reason , it was cause she was staight and "" normal"" according to them. Fast forward , At 18 i got into a good college and my parents paid it's fees . When 4 years later i graduated , they wanted me to get married to a ""good boy"" soon but i applied for masters program in a university abroad and got in with a scholarship.
My parents said if i went there they would disown me for real this time . I went to Germany to study and my parents kept their word and cut off all contact with me . I had done editing freelancing and worked as a social media manager during my college days so i had some money saved up to survive in Germany for a while without my parents support . Anyway for 3 years my parents didn't contact me , i graduated from the university and am now working in a company which pays me well enough. Two days ago i got a call from my parents that they were broke & had lost all their money cause my elder system had gone addicted to gambling and had lost our house & other dad's properties in the game. My parents asked me to send $2500 to then because they were really struggling and expected me to help them. I just called them selfish giants  cussed at them and hung up . They called me again and said i owed them the money cause they had kept me in their house and paid for my education , food and other basic requirements even after knowing that I was gay. They said I am basically ""abandoning them at their worst situation"" I just told them they wouldn't get anything from me and hung up . I told my partner she says i am not obliged to help them . One of my best friends said that i have been acting like an AH and not being grateful to them 

So the question is to the people of reddit AITA in this situation ?

Also I can afford to send them $2500 , it won't harm me financially much but it's just that i chose not to send them the money",NTA,"Judgement: NTA, Title: AITA for abandoning my parents and refusing to give them any money ?","I (25F) called my parents selfish giants and refused to give them any money .
