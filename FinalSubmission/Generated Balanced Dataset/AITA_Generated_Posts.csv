0,YTA,"'AITA for expecting my roommate to pay for the entire broken stove, even though it was his fault?'","So, I (22F) live with my roommate, Jason (23M). We've been sharing this apartment for about a year now, and overall, things have been mostly fine between us. We both split the rent and utilities equally, and each of us has our own space in the kitchen for our food and cooking stuff.

Last week, Jason was cooking dinner and somehow managed to break our stove. He was trying to cook something on high heat, and suddenly there was a loud bang. Turns out, he cracked the glass top pretty badly, and now the stove isn't working at all. He admitted it was his fault, saying he turned the heat up too high and didn't realize the stove couldn't handle it.

Our landlord isn't the most accommodating person, but we had no choice but to let them know about the stove. They agreed to replace it but charged us the full cost of the new stove, which is $600. I immediately thought it was only fair for Jason to cover the entire amount since he was the one who broke it.

I confronted Jason about it, insisting he should pay the $600 since it was his mistake. But Jason thinks we should split it 50/50 because we're both responsible for the apartment's upkeep. He also pointed out that accidents happen and that we've always shared costs for repairs and maintenance before.

Our mutual friends are divided on the issue. Some of them agree with me, saying that Jason should pay because he was the one who broke it. Others think I'm being too harsh and that it's not fair to make him shoulder the entire expense.

Jason has been visibly stressed about the situation, and it's causing tension between us. Our once comfortable living arrangement is now awkward, and he's been avoiding me. The new stove was installed yesterday, and now we're just sitting on this unresolved financial issue.

So, AITA for expecting my roommate to pay for the entire broken stove, even though it was his fault?"
1,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'lost' phone was just hidden to avoid a bill?""","I (24F) live with my roommate, ""Cathy"" (23F), and we've been sharing an apartment for about a year now. Generally, we get along well, but there have been a few times when money has been a bit tight for both of us, and it has caused some tension.

A few weeks ago, Cathy mentioned that she lost her phone. She said she had no idea where it could be and was really upset about it. I tried to help her look for it, but after a while, she seemed to give up. I noticed that she didn't seem as worried about it after a few days, which struck me as odd. When our shared phone bill came due, she didn't have her part of the money ready. Knowing that she had been financially struggling lately, I started to wonder if she was using the lost phone as an excuse to avoid paying her portion of the bill.

I decided to confront her about it. I told her I thought it was suspicious that she lost her phone right before the bill was due and that she might just be pretending it was lost so she couldn't pay her share. Cathy got really upset and said that she genuinely lost her phone and was hurt that I would accuse her of lying. She then went to her room and slammed the door.

After our argument, I mentioned the whole situation to a few friends. Some of them said I was being paranoid and should trust Cathy, while others thought I had a point and should be cautious. A day later, Cathy found her phone wedged between the couch cushions, which made me feel pretty bad about the whole situation.

Things have been really tense between us since then. Cathy has been distant and cold, and I feel like I might have really hurt our friendship by accusing her. I honestly thought I was being practical and looking out for my own financial stability, but now I’m wondering if I crossed a line.

So, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's 'lost' phone was just hidden to avoid a bill?"
2,YTA,'AITA for making my roommate do all the household chores while I get to work from home and relax?',"I (28F) share a two-bedroom apartment with my roommate, Katie (26F). We've been living together for almost a year now, and our dynamic has mostly been smooth. However, there has recently been growing tension between us over household chores.

For context, I work from home as a graphic designer, while Katie works long hours as a nurse in a hospital. Her job is physically and emotionally demanding, and she often comes home exhausted. In contrast, my work schedule is more flexible, and I have the luxury of enjoying a more relaxed day-to-day routine.

Since Katie is out of the house most of the day, I've taken to relaxing in the evenings, catching up on shows or reading. I generally tidy up my immediate space, but the bulk of the household chores like deep cleaning, laundry, and taking out the trash have fallen to Katie. I thought this was a fair arrangement, considering she gets weekends off while I sometimes have to work on weekends to meet client deadlines.

Recently, Katie confronted me, saying she feels like she's doing all the work around the house and that it's unfair, especially given how exhausted she is from her job. She pointed out that just because I'm home more often, it doesn't mean I should automatically expect her to pick up the slack.

I tried to explain my perspective, saying that since I work from home, it's essential for me to have a clean and orderly environment to concentrate. I also mentioned that my weekends can sometimes be busy with work, so I can't always help out then. I genuinely didn't think it was a big deal, and I assumed things were balanced since I handle some chores during the week.

However, after our conversation, Katie has become noticeably distant and seems frustrated with me. Some mutual friends have chimed in, saying they understand both sides but that I should step up more given my flexible schedule. 

I truly didn't mean to make Katie feel burdened, but I also believe that just because I work from home doesn't mean I should be responsible for doing more chores. Am I the asshole for expecting Katie to handle the bulk of the household work while I maintain my routine?"
3,YTA,'AITA for getting into a public argument with my roommate over her extremely messy cooking habits?',"I (24M) live with my roommate, Jenna (23F), in a small apartment. We've been friends since college, and we decided to move in together about a year ago to save on rent. Most of the time, we get along well and manage to work through our differences. However, Jenna has a habit that has been driving me insane: she is an extremely messy cook.

Every time Jenna cooks, she leaves a trail of chaos behind her. Pots and pans are left unwashed, food scraps cover the counters, and spills are never cleaned up. I've spoken to her about it multiple times, but she always brushes it off, saying she's too tired to clean up immediately and will ""get to it later."" Spoiler alert: she rarely does.

Last weekend, we hosted a small dinner party for some friends. Right from the start, Jenna took over the kitchen and cooked up a storm. By the time our friends arrived, the kitchen looked like a war zone. I had already cleaned up after her several times earlier that week and was beyond frustrated. 

After dinner, everyone migrated to the living room to chat, leaving the kitchen in its disastrous state. I'd had enough. I walked straight into the living room and, in front of our friends, confronted Jenna about her mess. I told her she needed to take responsibility and clean up right then and there. Jenna was embarrassed and defensive, saying this wasn't the time or place for such a discussion. Our friends were awkwardly silent, clearly uncomfortable with the sudden confrontation.

The argument escalated, with Jenna accusing me of being controlling and inconsiderate of her feelings. I shot back that she was disrespectful of our shared space and my time since I was always the one left cleaning up. After a heated exchange, Jenna stormed out of the apartment, and the party quickly fizzled out as our friends made excuses to leave.

Since then, things have been tense between us. Jenna has been giving me the cold shoulder, and our conversations are minimal and strained. I've spoken to a few of our friends about the incident. Some think I was right to call her out, while others believe I should have handled it privately and not embarrassed her in front of everyone.

I realize now that I might have gone too far by confronting her publicly and making our friends uncomfortable. But at the same time, I'm tired of her mess and feel my frustration was justified. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for getting into a public argument with my roommate over her extremely messy cooking habits?"
4,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'emergencies' are just excuses to avoid paying rent?""","My roommate, Jake, and I have been living together for about a year now. Initially, everything was fine, but over the past few months, I've noticed a pattern. Every time rent is due, Jake suddenly has some kind of ""emergency"" that prevents him from paying on time. 

To give you a bit of background, Jake and I share a two-bedroom apartment, and we split the rent and utilities evenly. We're both in our late 20s and have steady jobs. Well, I thought we both had steady jobs, but now I'm starting to question that, given the frequency of his financial crises.

The incident that prompted me to write this post happened last week. Rent was due, and, surprise surprise, Jake texted me saying he wouldn't be able to pay his portion on time. This time, his car had apparently broken down, and he needed the money to fix it. I was already frustrated because this has happened for the third time in four months. In the past, it was a ""medical emergency,"" then it was ""family trouble,"" and now this.

I confronted Jake about it and told him that I'm tired of covering for him. I said that I think he's making up these emergencies to avoid paying rent. He got really upset and insisted that he wasn't lying and that these were real problems he couldn't avoid. Our conversation escalated into a full-blown argument, and he accused me of being insensitive and not understanding his situation. I pointed out that as roommates, we both have a responsibility to ensure the rent is paid on time, and his constant excuses are making me doubt him.

To make matters worse, my girlfriend and a couple of our mutual friends are on his side. They think I'm being too harsh and not empathetic enough. They argue that emergencies do happen, and it's not Jake's fault that he's been unlucky recently. They suggested that I should help him out and be more supportive, but that's easy to say when it's not their money on the line.

Jake eventually managed to scrape together his portion of the rent a few days late, but now things are really tense between us. I've noticed he's been avoiding me, and the atmosphere in the apartment is awkward.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate's ""emergencies"" are just excuses to avoid paying rent?"
5,YTA,'AITA for assuming my partner's financial independence means they don't need my help with basic expenses?',"I (29M) have been with my partner (27F) for about three years now. She’s a very independent person and has a well-paying job. From the beginning, it was clear that she values her financial independence, which I totally respected and admired. We both have our own places, but she spends a lot of time at my apartment, and we often go out or travel together.

Recently, she’s been dealing with some unexpected expenses—medical bills and car repairs—and it’s been stressing her out. I noticed she seemed more anxious than usual but didn’t think much of it since she’s always managed her finances well. She never directly asked me for money or mentioned needing help.

Last week, we were out with some friends, and the topic of finances came up. One of our friends casually mentioned how they support each other financially when times get tough. I made a comment about how it’s great that my partner is so financially independent that she doesn’t need any help with basic expenses. My partner went quiet, and the rest of the night was a bit awkward.

Later, at home, she confronted me about my comment. She said she felt hurt and unsupported, that just because she doesn’t explicitly ask for help doesn’t mean she wouldn’t appreciate it. She pointed out that in a partnership, it’s expected to support each other, especially during tough times, and my assumption made her feel like I didn’t care about her struggles.

I was taken aback and got defensive, saying she’s never asked for help and always made it seem like she wanted to handle things on her own. I felt justified in my actions (or lack thereof) because I thought I was respecting her wishes and independence.

However, she told me that being partners means offering support without always being asked and that my attitude made her feel isolated. My friends are divided on this; some think I should have offered to help, while others agree that it’s reasonable to wait until someone asks.

Since then, things have been tense between us. She’s been distant and not as open with me, and I’m starting to question if I made a huge mistake by not offering help sooner.

So, AITA for assuming my partner's financial independence means they don't need my help with basic expenses?"
6,YTA,"""AITA for forcing my roommate to pay for my entire weekend getaway?""","I recently had my birthday and decided to treat myself to a weekend getaway at a nice resort. I live with my roommate, Nick, who has always been a bit messy and inconsiderate. I’ve talked to him about cleaning up after himself multiple times, but he just doesn’t seem to get it. 

A week before my trip, I bought some groceries that included a special, expensive cake I was saving for my birthday celebration. I put a note on it in the fridge saying it was for my birthday and asked Nick not to touch it. 

The day before my trip, I came home to find Nick and a couple of his friends hanging out. They had eaten half of my cake and left the rest out on the counter, uncovered and ruined. I was furious. Nick apologized and offered to replace the cake, but I was still seething from the continuous lack of respect for my belongings.

I decided I’d had enough and told Nick he was going to pay for my entire weekend getaway as compensation. I argued that I deserved a stress-free birthday weekend after dealing with his behavior for so long. He reluctantly agreed but clearly wasn’t happy about it. 

Friends of mine have mixed opinions. Some think I was right to finally put my foot down and make him understand the consequences of his actions. Others think it was excessive to make him pay for the entire trip over a ruined cake and some inconsiderate behavior.

Nick paid for the trip, but our relationship has been pretty strained ever since. He claims I overreacted and took advantage of the situation. I’ve noticed he’s been more distant and less talkative since I got back.

Now I’m starting to wonder if I went too far. Am I the asshole for forcing my roommate to pay for my entire weekend getaway?"
7,YTA,"'AITA for assuming my roommate's entire rent was paid off because she had a ""good job""?'","I (25F) live in a three-bedroom apartment with two roommates, Julia (24F) and Lisa (27F). We split the rent evenly, and while things have been mostly smooth, there was a recent incident that has caused some major tension. Julia recently got a promotion and a salary bump, which she was really excited about. She works in finance, and she's always talking about her job and how well she's doing. 

Because of this, I assumed that her financial situation had significantly improved. Meanwhile, I’ve been struggling a bit with my own finances and falling behind on some payments. I didn't want to ask my parents for help, and getting a second job hasn't been easy. So, when the rent was due last month, I figured Julia could cover my part and I would pay her back later. After all, she’s doing so well now.

I didn't actually talk to her about it before the rent was due. I just assumed she'd understand and would be okay since she was making more money. When the landlord asked about the missing portion of the rent, I told him Julia could cover it because she had a good job. 

When Julia found out about this, she was furious. She said she never agreed to cover my part of the rent and that her own financial situation, despite the raise, wasn't as great as I assumed. She said she still had student loans and other expenses I apparently never considered. She ended up having to scramble to cover the remaining rent to avoid late fees, and now she's asking me to pay her back immediately.

Lisa thinks I was out of line for assuming Julia could just cover my portion without even asking. She says that even if Julia is in a good financial spot, it doesn’t mean she’s responsible for my share. 

Now Julia is barely talking to me, and Lisa is also giving me a cold shoulder. I honestly thought since we're friends and she’s got this great job, she'd be fine helping out just this once. It didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. But now I’m starting to wonder if I really misjudged the situation.

AITA for assuming my roommate's entire rent was paid off because she had a ""good job""?"
8,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive artwork was a hand-me-down and'reorganizing' it to save space?""","I (25M) recently moved in with a new roommate, Jake (27M). Jake has an amazing collection of artwork that he proudly displays throughout our shared apartment. Honestly, I’m not too familiar with art, it all looks the same to me. A lot of the pieces seemed old and, to my untrained eye, they looked like they could be hand-me-downs or things you’d find at a thrift store. 

Last weekend, I decided to do a bit of ""reorganizing"" around the apartment to create more space in our living area. We needed more room for some new furniture we’re planning on getting, and I thought a bit of decluttering would help. Without thinking much about it, I moved several of Jake’s art pieces to the storage unit in the basement. I left a few pieces up, but most of it I had packed away. I didn't think it was a big deal, since they just seemed like old family heirlooms or not particularly valuable items.

When Jake came home and saw what I had done, he was absolutely furious. He started yelling about how these pieces were not just ""old junk"", but were expensive artworks that he had spent years collecting and even spent considerable money on. He accused me of having zero respect for his things and stormed off to the basement to retrieve his art. He was so upset that he slept at a friend's place that night.

I thought he was overreacting, but then our mutual friends chimed in. Most of them sided with Jake, saying that it was an AH move to touch someone else’s belongings without asking, especially something as personal and possibly valuable as artwork. Some even pointed out that my ignorance about the art’s value didn’t excuse moving it without permission.

Since then, things have been really tense between Jake and me. He’s barely speaking to me, and it’s affecting our living situation in a big way. I tried to apologize, but he’s still really hurt and keeps pointing out how I need to respect his things in the future.

I thought I was just being practical and trying to make our shared space more liveable, but now I’m questioning if I really messed up. So, AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive artwork was a hand-me-down and ""reorganizing"" it to save space?"
9,YTA,'AITA for constantly criticizing my roommate's music choices and now she's moving out?',"I (23F) live with my roommate, Jess (22F), in a small apartment near our university. We’ve been roommates for about a year and generally got along well until recently. Jess is really into music and plays it almost all the time. In the beginning, it was kind of fun because she introduced me to a few new artists. However, our tastes in music couldn’t be more different. While she loves indie and alternative music, I’m more into pop and EDM.

At first, I just asked her to turn it down when I was trying to study or sleep, which she always did without complaint. But over time, her music started to really grate on my nerves. Instead of just asking her to turn it down, I started making snide comments about her taste, saying things like, ""How can you listen to this depressing stuff?"" or ""Ugh, another indie song? Can’t you play something with a beat?""

I didn’t realize at the time how often I was making these comments, but it seemed like every other day I was telling her how much I disliked her music. Jess would usually just laugh it off, but I noticed she started wearing headphones more often and avoiding common areas when she was listening to music.

Last week, we had a small get-together with some mutual friends. Jess was playing a playlist she made, and I made a joke in front of everyone about how she has the worst taste in music. Jess laughed it off at the time, but later that night, she confronted me. She said she was tired of me constantly putting down something she loves and that it made her feel unwelcome in her own home. I apologized, but she was clearly upset.

A few days after that, she told me she was moving out at the end of the month. I was shocked and asked her why, since our lease isn’t up for another six months. She just said she found a place where she could feel more at home and that it wasn’t just about the music, but it was the last straw.

I told some friends about the situation, expecting them to be on my side, but most of them think I was too harsh on Jess and didn’t respect her preferences. They pointed out that I could have handled it better and that my constant criticism might have made her feel really uncomfortable.

Now I’m left feeling guilty and wondering if I was in the wrong. I didn’t mean to push her away, but maybe I went too far. So, Reddit, AITA for constantly criticizing my roommate's music choices and now she's moving out?"
10,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive new pet is a status symbol and giving it the side-eye?""","I live with my roommate, Jess, in a small two-bedroom apartment. We've been living together for about a year, and things have been generally good—until recently. Jess has always loved animals, but because of our lease, we've only had low-maintenance pets like fish. I knew she wanted something more exotic, but I didn't think it was feasible.

A few weeks ago, Jess started dropping hints about getting a new pet. I didn't think much of it until she brought home a Bengal cat. These cats are known for being quite expensive and unique. I was taken aback because Jess doesn't make a lot of money; she's working part-time while finishing her degree. 

At first, I thought maybe she saved up or got a good deal, but then I started thinking about how Jess has a history of wanting to keep up appearances. She loves high-end brands and always gets the latest gadgets, even if she can't really afford them. So, I couldn't help but feel that this cat was just another status symbol for her, something to show off on social media and to her friends.

I've been giving her and the cat the side-eye, and she noticed. Jess confronted me about why I've been acting weird around her new pet. I told her that I thought she got the cat just to show off, that it seemed like a waste of money she didn't have. She got really upset and said that she genuinely wanted the cat and had been saving up for it for a long time. She explained how much she researched and how much she loves animals, and that this cat is a dream come true for her.

Some of our mutual friends have mixed opinions. A few think I was just looking out for her financial well-being, while others say I was being judgmental and insensitive. Jess is not talking to me much now, and the atmosphere at home is really tense. Our friendship feels strained, and I'm wondering if I overstepped.

Was I the asshole for assuming Jess's new pet was just a status symbol and giving it the side-eye?"
11,YTA,'AITA for assuming my roommate was lying about their job and cutting them off financially without giving them a chance to explain?',"Hi everyone. This is a situation that's been eating at me, and I need some perspective. I'm a 27-year-old guy living with my roommate, Alex, who's 25. We've been sharing an apartment for about a year now. For context, I've known Alex since college, and we've always had a good relationship. 

Alex works freelance, doing various graphic design jobs, while I have a stable 9-to-5 corporate job. Alex has always managed to pay their share of the rent and bills, though sometimes a little late. Recently, Alex started talking about landing a big project with a promising client. They seemed thrilled, but I couldn't help but be skeptical. I mean, I've seen Alex struggle to find stable gigs in the past, and suddenly they're talking about this big project?

A few weeks ago, Alex mentioned they might need some financial help until their client pays out. I agreed to cover their share of the rent for the month. However, as the weeks went by, I didn't see any signs of this big project materializing. Alex was still home all day, not attending meetings or working late like I would expect from someone with a major project. My skepticism grew, and I started to suspect that Alex might be lying about the whole thing to get me to cover their expenses.

So, I decided to confront Alex. Instead of having an open conversation, I bluntly told them I couldn't support them financially anymore and that they needed to figure things out. Alex tried to explain, but I was firm and cut them off. I told them that if they couldn't pay their share, they needed to find somewhere else to live. 

Alex looked devastated and tried to explain that the payment from the client was delayed due to some administrative issues, but I didn't want to hear it. I felt like I was being taken advantage of and couldn't let that happen.

Fast forward another week, and I found out through a mutual friend that Alex was indeed telling the truth. The client really did exist, and the project was legitimate. The payment delay was due to some bureaucratic red tape. I immediately felt like a complete jerk.

My friends are divided. Some say I had a right to be cautious, while others think I should have trusted Alex and at least given them a chance to explain before making such a drastic decision. Alex has moved out and is staying with a friend, and our relationship is strained to say the least.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate was lying about their job and cutting them off financially without giving them a chance to explain?"
12,YTA,AITA for refusing to help my brother financially after he lied to me about getting a job?,"My younger brother, Tom, has been struggling to find stable employment for the past few years. He's 25 now, and our family has been supportive, though it’s been tough seeing him lurch from one dead-end gig to the next. About six months ago, he asked to move in with me until he could “get on his feet.” I agreed, thinking it would be for a few months at most.

I made it clear that I expected him to contribute to the household expenses as soon as he found a job. At first, Tom seemed really motivated. He’d be out of the house during the day, come home and talk about interviews and leads he was following up on. We were both optimistic that things would turn around for him soon.

After about three months, though, I noticed he wasn’t talking about job prospects as much. He started staying home more, playing video games and watching TV. I confronted him about it, and he assured me that he had found a job and was in the final stages of paperwork. He said he’d be starting “any day now” and would begin contributing to the household soon.

Another month passed, and there was still no sign of him working. When I pressed him, he doubled down on his story, saying there were just delays with the background check and that he’d definitely start soon. It sounded fishy, but I wanted to believe him. Well, last week I got a call from a mutual friend who let it slip that Tom hadn’t been looking for jobs at all. He’d been hanging out and goofing off during the day while pretending to job hunt. 

I was furious. That night, I confronted Tom with what I’d found out. He admitted it, saying he was too stressed out to look for work and just needed a break. I told him that was not acceptable and that I’d been more than patient. I gave him an ultimatum: either start contributing financially or move out. He said he couldn’t move out because he had no money and begged me to let him stay “just a bit longer” until he could really start job hunting again.

I was done. I told him he had a week to find somewhere else to stay. He called me heartless and accused me of giving up on him when he needed me most. Our parents are on his side, saying I should be more understanding since he’s going through a rough patch. They’ve offered to help him out financially, but they can’t take him in because they recently downsized. Meanwhile, friends are split—some say I’m justified, others think I’m being too harsh.

Since kicking him out, Tom has been couch-surfing and still hasn’t found a job. Our relationship is strained, and I'm starting to second-guess my decision. 

So, AITA for refusing to help my brother financially after he lied to me about getting a job?"
13,YTA,'AITA for assuming my roommate is lazy just because they don't share my work ethic?',"I (24M) have been living with my roommate, Alex (23M), for about six months now. We both moved to a new city for our jobs and decided to split an apartment to save on costs. From the beginning, it was clear that we had different lifestyles and work habits. I work in finance, often putting in 60-70 hours a week, and I thrive on staying busy and productive. Alex, on the other hand, works in a creative field, with flexible hours and a more laid-back approach to life.

The conflict started when I began to notice that Alex seemed to always be lounging around the apartment when I got home. I’d come back exhausted from a long day, only to find him watching TV, playing video games, or napping. It irked me that he seemed to have so much free time while I was constantly on the grind. I started making snide remarks about his ""lazy"" lifestyle and how he didn’t understand the concept of hard work.

One day, after a particularly grueling week, I snapped. I came home to the usual scene of Alex on the couch, and I lost it, accusing him of being lazy and not pulling his weight around the apartment. I ranted about how he didn’t understand what it meant to work hard and that he needed to start contributing more, not just in household chores but in general ambition and drive.

Alex was taken aback and tried to calmly explain that his job is demanding in different ways, requiring a lot of creative energy and that his downtime was necessary for his mental health and productivity. He also mentioned that he always made sure to do his share of the chores and bills, which, in fairness, he did. He told me it was unfair to judge his work ethic based on my standards and that everyone has their own way of managing work-life balance.

After our heated argument, I noticed a tangible tension in the apartment. Alex started spending more time in his room, and our easygoing interactions became awkward and strained. I confided in some friends about the situation, expecting them to side with me, but most of them said I was being unfair and that just because Alex’s work style was different, it didn’t mean he was lazy. They pointed out that I couldn’t impose my work habits on others and that my outburst was uncalled for.

Now, reflecting on the situation, I realize that my own stress and frustrations from work probably contributed to my outburst, but I also feel like I’m driven and determined, and I want to be surrounded by similar attitudes. However, I can see how my approach may have been too harsh and judgmental.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate is lazy just because they don't share my work ethic?"
14,YTA,'AITA for expecting my roommate to cook dinner every night just because I'm tired of ordering takeout?',"Brief Background: I (27m) live in a shared apartment with my roommate, Jake (25m). We've been living together for about a year now, and overall, things have been pretty smooth. We both have demanding jobs, but mine tends to require longer hours and more time in the office. Because of this, I'm usually exhausted when I get home.

The Incident: Over the past few months, I've noticed that we're always ordering takeout because neither of us has the energy to cook after a long day. This has started to wear on me—not just on my wallet, but also on my health. I decided to bring up the idea that Jake should take on the responsibility of cooking dinner every night. My reasoning was that his job is relatively less stressful and he typically gets home earlier than I do. So, I thought it wouldn't be that big of an ask.

When I mentioned this to Jake, he was pretty taken aback. He pointed out that cooking every night is a significant time commitment and that he also likes to unwind after work. He even suggested that we could split the cooking duties or meal prep on weekends to make things easier. But honestly, I feel like after a 12-hour workday, the last thing I want to do is cook, and I expected him to understand that. 

Friends' Opinion: I brought this up to our mutual friends to get some opinions. Most of them sided with Jake, saying that it wasn't fair to expect him to cook every night just because my job is more demanding. They suggested hiring a meal prep service or taking turns cooking, so it wouldn't all fall on him. One friend even suggested I take a cooking class to make it less stressful for me, which I thought was a bit much.

The Current Outcome: Since our discussion, things have been pretty tense between Jake and me. We still haven't come to an agreement, and I can tell he's annoyed whenever the topic of dinner comes up. He’s been making his own meals and not offering me any, which means I'm still stuck ordering takeout. It's clear that my suggestion didn't go over well, and now I’m wondering if I handled the situation poorly.

Conclusion: I’m starting to see that maybe my approach was a bit selfish, but I still think my reasoning has some merit. I just wanted to find a way to have healthier meals without the hassle. Now I'm unsure if I was being unreasonable. So, am I the asshole for expecting my roommate to cook dinner every night just because I'm tired of ordering takeout?"
15,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'free' labor is the same as mine, and getting angry when they asked for compensation?""","I've been living with my roommate, Sarah, for about a year now. We met through a mutual friend and hit it off well enough to decide to share a place. We both have pretty busy schedules, but I work from home while she's out at her job for most of the day.

Lately, I've found myself doing a lot of the household chores since I'm home more often. I didn't mind cleaning the living room, kitchen, and other common areas because it seemed fair, given our different schedules. In turn, Sarah would occasionally cook dinner or pick up groceries. It felt like we had an unspoken understanding about how we'd share the work in the house without having to discuss it formally.

A few weeks ago, I had a major project at work and found myself completely swamped. I asked Sarah if she could take over some of the chores for a couple of weeks until things settled down. She agreed, but after two weeks, she asked if we could sit down and talk about compensating her for the extra work she had done.

I was pretty taken aback. I thought of our previous arrangement where I did most of the chores without asking for anything in return, and I felt like she should have been willing to pitch in without expecting compensation. I told her as much and it led to a huge argument. She pointed out that she’s been working extra hours at her job and struggling to keep up with the additional chores. She felt that since I was getting paid for my work and she was essentially doing a second, unpaid job, some form of compensation was reasonable.

Our friends are split on the issue. Some think that Sarah's request is fair, given that the circumstances have changed. Others think that she shouldn't expect extra pay for just helping out when things get busy. Sarah now feels unappreciated and is giving me the silent treatment, which has made living together quite awkward. 

I didn't think I was asking for too much, but now I'm questioning if I misunderstood our arrangement. Am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's 'free' labor is the same as mine and getting angry when she asked for compensation?"
16,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive art collection was a scam?""","I (26M) recently moved in with a new roommate, Jake (28M). We found each other through an online listing and, after a few conversations, decided to share a two-bedroom apartment. Jake seemed like a cool guy, kept to himself mostly, and I didn’t foresee any major issues. One thing that stood out when I moved in, though, was his extensive art collection. He had these large, colorful canvases all over the place. Honestly, they looked like random splashes of paint to me, no offense to modern artists.

One evening, we were both home and had a few drinks together. We started chatting about our interests, and I brought up the art. I asked him how he acquired them and what they were worth. Jake explained that he’s a huge art enthusiast and has been collecting pieces for years. He mentioned a few artists’ names that I had never heard of and claimed some of the works were worth thousands of dollars.

Here is where I might have messed up. I laughed and, half-jokingly, said that I thought he got scammed. I mean, I had no idea art like that could be so valuable! I even said I could probably make something similar with some paint and a couple of hours. Jake went quiet and quickly changed the topic. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Over the next few days, Jake became distant. He’d lock his door more often and barely spoke to me. I noticed he wasn’t hanging his art up around the common areas anymore, and a few pieces seemed to have disappeared entirely. I asked him if everything was alright, and he bluntly said that my comments about his collection were hurtful and that he felt disrespected.

I tried to defend myself, saying it was just a joke and that I didn’t mean to offend him. I even pointed out that it’s hard for someone not into art to understand its value. Jake didn’t seem convinced and told me that making fun of someone’s passion, especially something they’ve invested so much time and money into, isn’t just a joke.

Some mutual friends weighed in and had mixed reactions. A few thought I was being insensitive and that I should’ve respected Jake’s interests regardless of my personal opinion. Others thought Jake was being too sensitive and that I was just expressing an innocent opinion.

As it stands, our living situation is awkward, and I’m trying to figure out how to address this. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's expensive art collection was a scam?"
17,YTA,"""AITA for getting upset when my partner refused to pay for a expensive dinner I'd already ordered?""","So, my partner (29M) and I (27F) have been together for about three years now. We’ve always split our expenses fairly evenly, but we occasionally treat each other to special dinners or experiences. Last Friday was supposed to be one of those special nights.

I had been having a rough week at work and really needed a pick-me-up. I suggested we go to this really fancy seafood place I’d been dying to try. My partner hesitated at first because he’s more of a homebody and prefers cooking at home, but he agreed when he saw how excited I was.

When we got to the restaurant, I went all out. I ordered the most expensive items on the menu, including a seafood tower and a bottle of wine that cost more than what we'd usually spend on a meal. My partner looked a bit uncomfortable with the prices but didn’t say anything. I thought it was a special treat, so I went ahead and indulged.

When the check came, I smiled and asked him if he could cover it this time as a treat for me. He looked at the bill and his eyes widened. He quietly asked if I was serious, and I said yes, reminding him that he hadn’t treated me in a while. He then said that he hadn’t agreed to pay for everything and that this was way out of our normal budget.

I got upset and felt humiliated. I told him he was being unreasonable and that he should have mentioned his concerns before we ordered. He insisted that we split the bill, which was incredibly awkward because I hadn’t brought enough to cover my half. I ended up having to transfer money from my savings to cover the cost.

On the way home, we barely spoke. I felt like he had ruined what was supposed to be a special evening and made me feel like a burden. My friends are split on this; some think he should have just paid to avoid the drama, while others say I should have been more considerate of our usual spending habits.

Now, things are tense between us, and I’m wondering if I was really out of line. I thought partners are supposed to treat each other sometimes, especially when one is feeling down. So, AITA for getting upset when my partner refused to pay for an expensive dinner I'd already ordered?"
18,YTA,'AITA for assuming my roommate's $1000+ video game collection is just a bunch of junk to be sold?',"A few weeks ago, my roommate, Alex, went on a trip and left me in charge of the apartment. I've known Alex for about a year now, and we've always had a decent relationship. He's a bit of a gamer, with shelves full of video games, consoles, and various gaming paraphernalia in our living room. Frankly, I've never understood his obsession with it all—I see it as a waste of space and money. 

While Alex was away, I had a bit of a financial crisis. I lost my job unexpectedly and needed to come up with rent money fast. As I was looking around the apartment, trying to figure out what I could sell, my eyes landed on Alex's extensive video game collection. To me, they just looked like a bunch of old, dusty games. I figured selling them would be a quick way to make some cash. 

I posted a few listings online and, to my surprise, got a lot of interest. I managed to sell a good chunk of his collection for about $200, which helped cover my rent for the month. When Alex returned, I thought he wouldn't even notice the missing games—he has so many, after all. 

However, he noticed almost immediately. When he confronted me, I told him about my financial situation and why I sold some of his games. He was furious, saying that his collection was worth well over $1000 and that some of the games were rare and had sentimental value. He demanded that I either get his games back or compensate him for the full value. 

I tried to explain that I didn't realize they were worth so much and that I thought I was doing what was necessary to keep a roof over my head. But Alex didn't want to hear it. Other friends and family have weighed in, with most of them siding with Alex and saying that I had no right to sell his belongings. Some have even suggested that I should have reached out for help instead of taking such drastic measures.

Now, our relationship is strained, and Alex is insisting that I pay him back in full or he'll take legal action. Looking back, I can see why he’s angry, but at the time, I felt like I didn't have many options.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's $1000+ video game collection was just a bunch of junk to be sold?"
19,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'friend' was a sex worker and freaking out about it?""","I (24F) have been living with my roommate, Mia (25F), for about a year now. Overall, we’ve had a great relationship, and I've never had any major issues with her or her friends visiting. But recently, something happened that I really need some perspective on.

A few weeks ago, Mia mentioned that she had a ""friend"" coming to stay with us for a few days. She didn’t give me much detail, just that he'd be in town and needed a place to crash. I didn’t think much of it until he arrived.

The friend, Mark (28M), showed up looking very... polished. I don’t know how else to describe it. He was impeccably dressed in designer clothes, very fit, and had the kind of charm you'd expect from someone in a sales job or something. From the get-go, I started feeling uneasy. He was overly friendly, almost too engaging, and just had this vibe that didn’t sit right with me.

The first night he stayed over, they went out for dinner and came back pretty late. I could hear them talking and laughing, which is fine, but something about the way Mia was talking about him before made me suspicious. She never mentioned how they met or anything, and given that this guy was clearly more than just some average Joe, I started putting pieces together in my head.

The next morning, I saw him leave the apartment super early, and Mia was acting kind of weird. I jumped to the conclusion that she had, perhaps, hired someone... you know, a sex worker. I felt a mix of worry and anger, thinking she might be putting us at risk by inviting strangers into our home. So, I confronted her about it.

I blurted out, ""Mia, I need to know if Mark is a sex worker. I'm not comfortable with you bringing people like that into our home!"" She looked shocked and immediately got defensive. She told me I was way out of line, that Mark was a friend from her old workplace, and that they had lost touch until recently. She said I had no right to make such an assumption and that I was being judgmental and hurtful.

After our argument, Mark left and didn't come back, which made me feel even worse. A few days later, Mia sat me down and explained in detail how she knew Mark and how my outburst had hurt both of them. She also brought up how my assumption reflected negatively on me, making me seem prejudiced and judgmental.

I talked to a few friends about it, and opinions were mixed. Some thought I had a right to be concerned about safety, while others said I totally overstepped and was acting like an AH.

In the aftermath, Mia and I have been distant. I apologized, but things are still awkward. I now see that I jumped to conclusions without any real evidence and acted based on stereotypes.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate's friend was a sex worker and freaking out about it?"
20,YTA,"'AITA for assuming my roommate's food is free just because we're ""family""?'","I moved in with my best friend, Clara, about six months ago. We've been tight since college, and it just made sense to share an apartment when our leases were up. We always joked that we were like sisters, considering how close we were and how well we got along.

From the get-go, we had a pretty relaxed arrangement. We shared a lot of things—Netflix accounts, Wi-Fi, and sometimes even clothes. Naturally, I thought this ""family"" dynamic extended to food as well. I mean, in college, we'd often share meals or chip in together for takeout without keeping score. So, when she bought groceries, I never thought twice about using them. If I needed an egg for breakfast or some milk for my coffee, I’d just grab it from the fridge.

Things started to unravel a bit when I noticed Clara seemed a bit annoyed whenever she found food missing. She'd make comments like, ""I could've sworn I had more yogurt,"" or ""Didn't I just buy cheese?"" At first, I brushed it off as her being forgetful, but it became more frequent.

A couple of weeks ago, Clara confronted me directly. She said she was tired of her groceries disappearing and feeling like she was shouldering more of the food expenses. I was taken aback and reminded her that we were like family, and in families, you share things without keeping track. I assumed that she would understand this and not make a big deal out of it.

Clara, however, didn’t see it that way. She told me that while she values our friendship, she also works hard for her money and expects some respect for the things she buys. She suggested we either start labeling our food or split the grocery bills more equitably.

I tried to explain my perspective, but she cut me off, saying that the “family” argument doesn’t hold up when one person feels consistently taken advantage of. She said it’s not just about the money but also about respect and consideration.

Since then, there's been this weird tension between us. She’s started labeling her food, which feels really cold and formal to me. Our friends are divided—some think I should’ve been more considerate from the start, while others say Clara's overreacting and that she should chill out.

Honestly, I’m confused. I never meant to exploit her or make her feel unappreciated. I just thought we had an understanding. Now, I’m worried I might have damaged our friendship over something stupid like groceries.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate's food is free just because we're ""family""?"
21,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive art pieces are worthless and getting rid of them without asking?""","I live with my roommate, Jenna, who is an art student. We’ve been sharing this apartment for about a year now. Jenna is really into her art, and she’s always working on new projects. Our living room was starting to look like an art gallery with her pieces everywhere. Personally, I'm not into art at all and never understood the appeal. Some of her work looked unfinished or just odd to me – like splashes of color or random objects glued together.

Last weekend, I decided to do a deep clean of our apartment while Jenna was away visiting her family. I thought it would be a nice surprise for her to come back to a spotless place. As I was tidying up, I came across a few of her art pieces that had been sitting in the corner for weeks. They looked like junk to me – just canvases with random paint splotches and weirdly put-together sculptures. I figured they were just experiments gone wrong or abandoned projects and decided to clear them out.

I ended up throwing those pieces in the trash. I didn’t think much of it at the time, as I assumed they had no value. When Jenna returned and saw her art was missing, she freaked out. I told her I had thrown them away and she was livid. She explained that those pieces were part of her latest collection for a gallery show and were worth a lot of money. She was nearly in tears.

Jenna’s been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. Some of our mutual friends heard about the incident and told me that I was in the wrong. They said I should have asked Jenna before getting rid of anything. But to me, it just looked like clutter and I was trying to help.

AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive art pieces were worthless and getting rid of them without asking?"
22,YTA,'AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive furniture was just a hand-me-down from her parents?',"I [25F] recently moved in with a new roommate, Anna [24F]. We found each other through a mutual friend, and since we both needed a place to live in the city, we decided to move in together. Anna moved in first, and by the time I arrived, she'd already furnished the entire living room with beautiful, high-end furniture.

I've always had a pretty laid-back attitude about furniture and decor. My own stuff is mostly inexpensive items I've collected over the years or hand-me-downs from family and friends. So, when I saw Anna's furniture, I just assumed it was incredibly nice stuff gifted to her by her wealthy parents. I never stopped to think that she might have actually invested her own money into furnishing our place.

One day, we were chatting in the living room, and I casually mentioned how nice it was that her parents had given her such beautiful furniture. Anna looked taken aback and asked why I thought her parents had bought it. I shrugged and said something along the lines of, ""Well, it's all so expensive-looking. I just figured it was a gift.""

Anna's expression changed, and she calmly explained that she had saved up for months, working overtime shifts at her job to be able to afford everything. She took a lot of pride in creating a comfortable and stylish living environment for us. She then mentioned how it felt dismissive and hurtful that I had assumed she didn’t earn it herself.

I felt awkward and apologized, but I could tell she was still upset. She went to her room shortly after and has been noticeably distant ever since. When I talked about this incident with our mutual friend, she agreed that I should have been more thoughtful and not made assumptions about Anna's situation. Another friend, however, said I meant no harm and that Anna was overreacting.

Our relationship has been strained since then, and it feels like there’s a lingering tension in the apartment. I'm starting to wonder if I really did mess up and if there's a way to fix things between us.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive furniture was just a hand-me-down from her parents?"
23,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive furniture was part of the lease and getting rid of it when they moved out?""","My roommate, Alex, and I had been living together for the past two years in a nice apartment downtown. Alex had a great eye for design, and over time, they filled our shared space with beautiful, high-end furniture. When we first moved in, we agreed that I would handle the bills and groceries, while Alex would take care of furnishing the apartment. It worked great for us—until Alex announced they were moving out.

Two months ago, Alex got a job offer in another state and decided to move out. We didn't discuss the furniture much since I assumed it was included in our lease agreement. When Alex left, they took their personal belongings but left all the furniture behind. I figured they didn’t need it anymore or couldn’t take it along, so I assumed it was part of the apartment now.

A few weeks after Alex moved out, I decided to redecorate and make the space my own. I sold most of the furniture, thinking I’d use the money to buy new pieces that suited my style. I made a decent amount of money and quickly replaced everything with items I liked more. Just as I was getting comfortable with my newly decorated apartment, Alex contacted me in a panic, asking when they could come pick up their furniture.

I was shocked and explained that I thought it was part of the lease since they didn't take it with them. Alex was furious when they heard I had sold everything. They accused me of stealing and demanded that I repay them or buy identical replacements. I felt blindsided and argued that it was a reasonable assumption on my part. Why would they leave it behind if they wanted to keep it?

Our mutual friends are divided on this issue. Some think Alex should’ve clarified what was happening with the furniture, while others think I was completely out of line for not confirming with Alex before selling anything. Alex’s family has even reached out, telling me how disappointed they are and insisting I am responsible for this mess.

The current outcome is a strained relationship with Alex, who is threatening legal action if I don't compensate them for their lost belongings. I feel bad about the situation, but I genuinely thought I was in the clear.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive furniture was part of the lease and getting rid of it when they moved out?"
24,YTA,'AITA for being a control freak and micromanaging my partner's entire life?',"My partner, Alex, and I have been together for four years. Over the past year, I've noticed that Alex has been struggling with time management and some personal responsibilities. Being a naturally organized person, I started stepping in to help, but now it seems like I'm managing everything in Alex's life.

It started small: I'd remind Alex of appointments and deadlines, and occasionally pick up some slack around the house. But over time, it escalated. I began creating detailed schedules for Alex, dealing with their work-related tasks, and essentially making all the household decisions. I thought I was being supportive, but Alex started to push back, saying I was being overbearing.

For instance, I recently reorganized Alex's personal workspace without asking. I thought it would make things easier, but Alex was visibly upset about it, saying they couldn't find anything and felt like their personal space was invaded. I also started deciding on Alex's diet and exercise routine, thinking it would improve their health, but Alex told me they felt like they had no autonomy.

Friends and family have also weighed in. Some understand that I just want the best for Alex, but others, including Alex's closest friend, have told me flat out that I need to back off and let Alex handle their own life. Alex’s family thinks I’m just trying to help, but my own family has said I might be crossing boundaries.

It all came to a head last weekend when Alex had planned a little surprise date night. It was meant to be a spontaneous evening, but I couldn't stand the lack of structure and ended up rearranging the entire evening according to my plan. Alex was really hurt, and it led to a big argument. Alex said they felt like they were living with a parent rather than a partner and needed space to make their own decisions and mistakes.

Since then, Alex has been distant, and it feels like there's a wall between us. I’m starting to realize that maybe I’ve overstepped, but a part of me still feels that I was just trying to help. I genuinely thought I was making things better for both of us by being involved in everything.

So, AITA for being a control freak and micromanaging my partner's entire life?"
25,YTA,'AITA for assuming my roommate's 10-year-old child is a distraction in the apartment and raising their rent?',"My roommate, Chris (M35), moved in with me about a year ago. We've been getting along pretty well, and everything had been smooth sailing until a few months ago. Chris has a 10-year-old daughter, Lily, who spends weekends with us since her mom works odd hours on Saturdays and Sundays. When Chris mentioned this arrangement initially, I agreed, thinking that it would be manageable and not a big deal.

However, over time, I started feeling that Lily's presence in the apartment was becoming a distraction. I work from home, and having a kid around – even if it's just on weekends – has impacted my concentration. She plays, sings, sometimes argues with Chris, and it just feels like there's always some form of noise. One evening after a particularly noisy weekend, I decided to bring it up with Chris. I told him that I felt Lily was a distraction and suggested that he could either find another arrangement for her during weekends or perhaps they could spend more time at her mom's place.

Chris was visibly upset and explained that he didn't have many options, as he wanted to spend time with his daughter. I then mentioned that if this arrangement was to continue, I would have to raise his share of the rent since having an extra person around was impacting my living situation. I thought it was a fair compromise, but Chris looked hurt and shocked. He said raising the rent because of his daughter was unreasonable and that he was already struggling to make ends meet. 

Our mutual friends had mixed reactions. Some sides with me, saying I had the right to a peaceful living environment, while others thought my request was unfair and insensitive. They pointed out that Lily is his child and he already pays for half of the living expenses. I felt that my suggestion was logical, but now Chris is avoiding me and our interactions have become awkward. Lily has even started spending less time around the apartment, which I didn't intend to happen, but it feels too quiet now. 

Given the way things have developed, I'm second-guessing whether I handled this the right way. AITA for assuming my roommate's 10-year-old child is a distraction in the apartment and raising their rent?"
26,YTA,'AITA for assuming my roommate was lazy just because she didn't help with the move on a moment's notice?',"A little context: I've been living with my roommate, Sarah, for about six months. We met through mutual friends and decided to move in together to save on rent. Overall, we get along fine, but we don't know each other super well yet. 

Last weekend, our landlord informed us he was renovating our apartment and we needed to move out temporarily. The timeline was tight—this was on Friday, and we had to be out by Monday morning. I immediately started packing and moving as much as I could over the weekend. Sarah, however, seemed to be lounging around and didn't help at all. I felt really stressed out managing everything on my own and frankly, I was pissed that she wasn't lending a hand.

On Sunday evening, I confronted Sarah about not helping with the move. She looked genuinely shocked and told me she had actually been working all weekend on some urgent projects for her job, which she does remotely. She had previously mentioned having a demanding job, but I guess I underestimated just how time-consuming it could be. She said she planned to move her stuff late Sunday night when her work was done, and indeed, by Monday morning, her belongings were packed and transported.

Our mutual friends have pretty mixed opinions about what happened. Some think Sarah should have made more of an effort to help out, while others believe I overreacted and shouldn't have assumed she was slacking off without knowing the full story. Sarah, understandably, is pretty upset with me and has been giving me the cold shoulder. 

Now, the apartment is in chaos, with boxes everywhere, and the tension between us makes it hard to settle in and unpack. Sarah barely speaks to me unless it's necessary, and I can tell she's still hurt by my assumptions.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate was lazy just because she didn't help with the move on a moment's notice?"
27,YTA,AITA for expecting my roommate to pay for the entire broken lease due to her own carelessness?,"I recently moved in with a friend of mine, Lisa, and things were going smoothly until something happened that has now completely turned our living situation upside down. Lisa and I agreed to a one-year lease on a nice apartment close to our college. We split the rent and utilities equally, and everything seemed fine.

A few weeks ago, Lisa accidentally left a candle burning while we were both out. Unfortunately, it caught some nearby papers on fire, which then spread to a curtain. Thankfully, the fire was put out quickly by the fire department, but the damage was significant enough that our landlord decided to terminate our lease early. He cited negligence and said he couldn’t trust us to take care of the property.

Here’s where the conflict starts. The lease termination means we are on the hook for the remaining months of rent until the landlord can find new tenants. I was furious at Lisa for her carelessness and told her that she should be responsible for the entire cost of the broken lease since it was her fault. I even suggested she take a loan or ask her parents for help because I wasn't going to pay a penny of it.

Lisa was understandably upset and argued that accidents happen and that we should split the cost since we were both living there. She thinks it’s unfair to put the entire financial burden on her, especially when she didn't intentionally cause the fire. She’s also been incredibly stressed and has been staying with family ever since, leaving me to handle moving out on my own.

My parents and some friends I’ve spoken to about this agree with Lisa and say that expecting one person to cover the entire lease is unreasonable, especially since we're both on the lease contract. They believe I'm being too harsh and that we should share the responsibility since we’re both adults and roommates.

This situation has put a significant strain on our friendship, and now I’m wondering if I was too quick to lay all the blame and financial burden on her. I feel it was her carelessness that led to this mess, but now I’m second-guessing my stance.

So, AITA for expecting my roommate to pay for the entire broken lease due to her own carelessness?"
28,YTA,'AITA for assuming my roommate's kid is a bad influence and kicking them out without giving her a chance to fix the problem?',"I [30M] have been living with my roommate [28F], Sarah, for about two years now. We get along really well, and she's been an overall great roommate. Recently, her 13-year-old daughter, Emily, had to come live with us full-time due to some issues with her ex.

At first, everything was fine. Emily is a nice kid, respectful and well-mannered. However, I noticed some changes around the apartment. A few things went missing, like my watch and a small amount of cash from my drawer. I also caught Emily sneaking out late at night once, and she was quite defensive and rude when I confronted her about it.

I jumped to the conclusion that she was a bad influence and a troublemaker. Without discussing any of these concerns with Sarah, I told her they both needed to find another place to live. Sarah was shocked and heartbroken. She begged me to give her a chance to address the issues and assured me she’d get to the bottom of it, but I was firm in my decision. I felt justified because it was my home, too, and I didn’t want to deal with the stress.

Sarah and Emily moved out within a week, but since then, I've been getting flak from mutual friends and even my family. They’ve been telling me that I was too harsh and didn't give Sarah an opportunity to handle the situation properly. They said I should've at least talked to her before making such a drastic decision. My mom even suggested that the missing items could’ve been misplaced and that I was too quick to judge Emily.

Now, with some time to reflect on everything, I’m wondering if I might have overreacted. Sarah has since found a new place, but our friendship is hanging by a thread.

So, AITA for assuming the worst about Emily and kicking them out without giving Sarah a chance to fix the problem?"
29,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's food was fair game just because the fridge was shared?""","I moved into a new apartment a few months ago with a roommate I found through an online ad. Let's call him Jake. We hit it off pretty well initially, both being in our mid-20s and sharing similar interests. We agreed early on that we would share the cost of common household items like cleaning supplies and non-perishable foods, but we never really got into the nitty-gritty of what to do about the stuff in the fridge.

A few weeks into living together, I noticed that Jake would bring home a lot of groceries. He works a well-paying job and tends to buy the organic, fancy stuff, while I’m still on a pretty tight budget and can't afford those kinds of luxuries. One evening, I was really hungry and there wasn’t much of my own food left. Seeing as we share a fridge, I assumed it wouldn’t be a big deal if I grabbed a bit of Jake's almond milk for my cereal. I replaced it the next day, thinking it was no harm done.

However, this turned into a bit of a habit. Over the next month, I found myself regularly dipping into Jake’s stash – a sandwich here, some fancy cheese there. I always meant to replace what I took, but sometimes I’d forget or tell myself it wasn’t a big deal. After all, we share the fridge, right?

Well, Jake noticed. Recently, he confronted me about it, saying he’s missing a lot of his groceries and it’s obvious I’ve been helping myself. He was clearly upset, explaining that he budgets his food carefully and expects that what he buys for himself remains his. He said he didn’t mind sharing occasionally, but it became clear I was taking advantage.

I didn’t think it was such a big issue, but Jake disagreed. He pointed out that I never asked for permission and that it felt dishonest. Our mutual friends are split on the issue: some say I should have known better, while others think Jake is overreacting about some groceries.

Now, things are pretty tense between us. Jake started labeling all his food, and he’s much colder towards me. I feel bad, as it was never my intention to cause a rift, but at the same time, it's just food.

Am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's food was fair game just because the fridge was shared?"
30,YTA,"'AITA for assuming my roommate's cooking is an ""emergency"" and expecting me to take over every time?'","Hey everyone, I want to share something that recently happened and left me questioning if I was in the wrong. Buckle up, it's a bit of a ride.

So, my roommate and I have been living together for about six months. Let's call her Julia. Julia is a sweet girl, fresh out of her parents' house, and not very experienced with cooking. She tends to struggle with the basic stuff—burnt toast, undercooked pasta, the works. I, on the other hand, love cooking and am pretty good at it.

This all started a couple of weeks ago. Julia decided to make a meal for both of us, which I thought was sweet. However, I walked into the kitchen to find it full of smoke, and she was trying to stir-fry veggies with the burner cranked up to the highest setting. I panicked and jumped in to help her salvage the meal. She was really grateful at the time and we had a laugh about it.

But this kept happening. Every time Julia tried to cook, she'd call me into the kitchen, either explicitly asking for help or standing there helplessly until I intervened. It got to the point where I started assuming she couldn't handle it, and I'd take over without even asking.

Last Friday, I walked in to find her struggling to flip a pancake that was half-burnt and half-raw. Without thinking, I grabbed the spatula and took over. Julia snapped at me, saying she was tired of me treating her like she couldn't do anything right. I was taken aback and muttered something about not wanting our apartment to catch fire. She stormed out and didn't talk to me for the rest of the night.

Since then, mutual friends have weighed in. Some of them think I'm just trying to help, but others have pointed out that I might be undermining her efforts and making her feel incompetent.

Julia and I had a tense conversation the next day. She said she appreciates my cooking skills but feels like I'm overstepping and not giving her a chance to learn. I apologized but pointed out that it's hard to stand by when the kitchen looks like a disaster zone.

Since then, our dynamic has been strained. I’ve been trying to give her space in the kitchen, but it's awkward and tense. She's been making simple meals for herself while I've been eating takeout or cooking when she's not around.

So, AITA for assuming Julia's cooking attempts were emergencies and taking over every time?"
31,YTA,"""AITA for assuming my roommate was being lazy when they were actually having a mental health crisis?""","I (24F) live with my roommate, Sarah (25F), and we've been sharing an apartment for about two years. Sarah has always been a bit quiet and keeps to herself, while I'm more of the outgoing, social type. We generally got along well, splitting the chores and respecting each other's space. However, over the past month, I noticed Sarah becoming increasingly withdrawn. She stopped participating in our usual cleaning schedule and her side of the apartment became messier and messier.

I tried dropping hints and reminders about the chores, but she seemed to ignore them. I started getting frustrated, thinking she was just being lazy and inconsiderate. This culminated last week when I came home to find the kitchen a complete mess. Dishes were piled up, the trash was overflowing, and there was an awful smell lingering in the air. I lost my temper and confronted Sarah, accusing her of being lazy and not pulling her weight around the apartment.

Sarah broke down in tears and confessed that she has been struggling with severe anxiety and depression. She told me that she was finding it hard to get out of bed, let alone keep up with the chores. She said she had been trying to muster the energy to talk to me about it, but my constant nagging made her feel even worse and more ashamed.

After this revelation, I felt awful. I had no idea she was going through such a tough time and immediately regretted all the things I said. She apologized for not telling me sooner, and I apologized for assuming she was just being lazy without considering that something more serious might be going on. But the damage was done. Sarah has been even more distant since the argument and avoids me whenever she can. I feel like I've destroyed any trust we had and I'm not sure how to fix it.

My friends are divided. Some think that my reaction was understandable given the circumstances, but others believe I should have been more compassionate and asked if something was wrong before jumping to conclusions. I've been trying to find ways to support her better, but I'm not sure if my efforts are helping or just making things worse.

So, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate was being lazy when they were actually having a mental health crisis?"
32,YTA,"""AITA for refusing to take my adult child's calls after they cut me out of their life for 5 years?""","My only child, Alex, and I had a falling out about five years ago. At that time, they were dealing with a lot of personal issues, including struggling with their mental health. We had a huge argument, and Alex decided to cut me out of their life completely. They changed their phone number, blocked me on all social media, and refused to reply to any emails or letters I sent. It was incredibly painful, but I respected their wishes and gave them the space they clearly needed.

During those five years, I did my best to move on with my life. I focused on my work, rekindled old friendships, and even started dating again. While I still thought about Alex often and worried about them, I stopped trying to contact them after the first year. It hurt too much to be constantly rejected.

Then, out of the blue, last month I received a phone call from an unknown number. It was Alex. They apologized for cutting me out of their life and said they wanted to reconnect. They mentioned how much they've changed and grown and how they missed me. I was in shock and didn’t know how to respond, so I gave a polite but neutral response and ended the call quickly.

Since then, Alex has been calling me almost every day, leaving messages and sending texts. But I can’t help but feel a lot of resentment. They left me in the dark for five years without any explanation or closure. I went through so much pain and loneliness because of it. Now they want to step back into my life as if nothing happened? I feel like they need to understand the consequences of their actions.

My friends are divided on this. Some think I’m justified in my feelings and that Alex needs to understand the hurt they caused. Others think I’m being too harsh and that life is too short to hold onto grudges, especially when it comes to family.

Since I’ve refused to answer most of their calls, Alex has started to reach out to other family members, trying to apologize and reconnect through them. My sister thinks I’m being an asshole for holding onto my resentment and not giving Alex a chance to explain and make amends.

I’ve been thinking about this a lot and am starting to doubt myself. Maybe I am being too harsh. But then I remember how deeply the rejection hurt and I hesitate again. Am I the asshole for refusing to take my adult child's calls after they cut me out of their life for five years?"
33,NAH,AITA for assuming my roommate is joking about doing laundry and not doing it myself?,"I (22F) share an apartment with my roommate, Lisa (23F). We've been living together for about a year and generally get along quite well. We both have busy schedules with work and school, so we try to split household chores as evenly as possible.

Last week, Lisa mentioned she had a huge project coming up and asked if I could handle the laundry for the next week or two. Honestly, she's made similar requests in the past but always with a joking tone, like saying, ""Wouldn't it be great if you just did all the laundry this week?"" which we both usually laugh off. So, when she mentioned it this time, I assumed she was kidding again and laughed it off, saying, ""Sure, sure, in your dreams.""

A few days passed, and I noticed the laundry pile getting bigger. I didn't think much of it because, hey, life gets busy, and I figured she would handle it when she had some free time. However, this morning, Lisa confronted me rather upset, asking why I hadn't done the laundry as she had requested. I was taken aback and explained that I thought she was joking, as she had done before.

Lisa looked genuinely hurt and said she really needed my help this time because of her project stress. Feeling guilty, I apologized and immediately took care of the laundry. I told her she should've been more explicit about her needs, but she argued that I should have taken her seriously, knowing how much pressure she's been under lately.

When I mentioned this situation to a few friends, they were divided. Some felt that Lisa should have clarified she was serious, while others thought I should have recognized her stress and helped her out regardless of whether I thought she was joking.

Now, our dynamic feels a bit tense, and while we've talked it out and I've agreed to help more, I can't shake the feeling that I really messed up. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate was joking about doing the laundry and not taking care of it myself?"
34,NAH,"""AITA for letting my adult child think I'm not supporting their decision, when really I'm just trying to subtly nudge them back on track?""","I (56f) have a wonderful and independent adult child, Alex (28nb). Alex has always been headstrong and determined, often making decisions that align with their passions rather than practicality. They've tried their hand at various careers and hobbies, which I admire, but it has also led to some instability in their life.

A few months ago, Alex decided to quit their steady job as a graphic designer to pursue a career as a full-time artist. While I completely support their passion for art—Alex is incredibly talented—I worry about them financially. The job market is tough, and living as a full-time artist can be unpredictable and inconsistent when it comes to income. 

Instead of outright telling Alex that I don’t support their decision, I've tried to subtly nudge them towards finding a part-time job or at least looking into freelance graphic design work to supplement their income. My subtle hints have included forwarding job listings or casually mentioning the potential benefits of having a more stable income. 

However, Alex has taken my subtle nudges as a sign that I don’t believe in their dreams or support their decision. They’ve grown increasingly distant, often making comments like, “I know you think I’m going to fail,” or “You don’t believe in my art.” It breaks my heart because I want them to succeed and be happy, but I also want them to be secure and not face financial hardship.

I’ve talked to close friends and family about the situation, and opinions are mixed. Some agree with me, saying that it’s important for Alex to have a backup plan. Others think I should be more direct and honest about my concerns, while a few believe I should step back entirely and let Alex handle it on their own, even if it leads to tough lessons.

As it stands, Alex is continuing with their art career, and I’ve backed off on offering unsolicited advice. Our relationship is still strained, and I’m unsure whether I’ve done the right thing by trying to subtly guide them without being direct about my concerns.

So, am I the asshole for letting my child think I’m not supporting their decision, when really, I’m just trying to nudge them back on track?"
35,NAH,"""AITA for not letting my roommate borrow my car for a second time without getting it detailed first?""","I live with my roommate, Jess, and we've always had a pretty easygoing relationship. We split the rent and utilities, share chores, and sometimes even cook for each other. A few weeks ago, Jess asked if she could borrow my car for a weekend trip because hers was in the shop. I didn't see any issue with it, so I handed over the keys.

When she returned the car, I noticed it was pretty dirty inside—crumbs on the seats, drink spills, and even some wrappers in the back. I was a bit annoyed but figured it was an oversight. I spent a couple of hours cleaning it out myself, chalking it up to ""one of those things.""

Fast forward to last week, Jess asked if she could borrow my car again for another weekend trip. This time, I told her she could borrow it, but only if she got it detailed first. I explained that the last time she used it, it came back pretty messy, and I pointed out that cleaning up after someone else's mess isn't something I enjoy. Jess seemed surprised and said she was in a hurry and didn't have time to get it detailed. She promised she would be more careful this time.

I insisted on the detailing before letting her borrow it again. Jess got frustrated and said I was being unreasonable, especially because she didn't mean to leave it messy the last time. She even mentioned that if she had the money for detailing, she'd rather put it towards her car repairs. I felt torn but stood my ground.

Some of our mutual friends have weighed in with mixed opinions. Some say I'm right to set terms for lending my car again, while others think I'm overreacting and should cut her some slack, considering she didn't do it intentionally.

As a result of this, Jess and I have been a bit distant, and I'm worried this might strain our otherwise good roommate relationship. I do understand her situation, but at the same time, I want to make sure my property is respected.

So, AITA for not letting my roommate borrow my car for a second time without getting it detailed first?"
36,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's expensive artwork is just prints because I'm not made of money?""","I've been living with my roommate, Lila, for about six months now. We got along really well from the start, and I thought we had a good understanding of each other's boundaries and habits. One thing that always caught my eye was the artwork in the common areas of our apartment. Beautiful pieces, but I honestly thought they were just prints or posters.

Lila has a knack for interior decorating, and our apartment looks like something out of a lifestyle magazine. I never really questioned where she got the art from because, well, I'm not rolling in cash, and I just kind of assumed she got them from some affordable online store. I mean, I have a couple of IKEA prints myself.

Last weekend, I had a few friends over. One of them is pretty knowledgeable about art and started complimenting the pieces. He asked me if they were originals, and I, without thinking, said, ""Oh, no, they must be prints. We're not made of money!"" Everyone laughed, and we moved on.

The next day, Lila seemed a bit off. She was quieter than usual, and I could tell something was bothering her. By the evening, she sat me down and explained that the artwork is actually original, expensive pieces she inherited from her late aunt, who was an artist. She went on to say that they mean a lot to her and that it hurt hearing them being dismissed so casually, even if it was unintentional on my part.

I immediately apologized and told her I honestly had no clue they were originals. I also explained that I didn't mean to come off as dismissive or unappreciative of her things. She accepted the apology but said she needed a bit of space to process everything.

Some friends think I was in the wrong for assuming and making that comment without knowing the facts. Others think it's an honest mistake anyone could have made under the circumstances. Lila's clearly hurt, and I feel terrible about it, but I genuinely didn't know. We're trying to move past it, but there's still some awkwardness lingering.

Am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's expensive artwork is just prints because I'm not made of money?"
37,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'guest' was a permanent resident and buying them a birthday gift?""","I (26F) live with my roommate, Sarah (27F), and we've been sharing an apartment for a little over a year. We get along really well and value our privacy, but we also enjoy each other's company and often have friends over. About six months ago, Sarah's friend, Alex (25M), started spending a lot of time at our place. It wasn't unusual at first, but eventually, Alex seemed to be there almost every day and night. 

I assumed he had moved in with us because he was always around, using the kitchen, watching TV, and even receiving packages at our address. I didn't mind Alex; he was polite and respectful. He always cleaned up after himself and contributed to household supplies, so I had no issues with him being there. 

Since Alex was around so much, I decided to add him to our sharing group for household expenses. Things like toilet paper and cleaning supplies were split three ways instead of two. Plus, I genuinely liked Alex and thought including him would make him feel welcome and appreciated.

Fast forward to last week, I found out through Sarah that Alex's birthday was coming up. I thought it would be a nice gesture to get him a birthday gift since he was practically living with us. I picked out a book I knew he would love and a card, and on his birthday, I surprised him with it. He seemed genuinely touched but also a bit confused.

Later that evening, Sarah pulled me aside and explained that Alex wasn't actually living with us. He was just going through a tough time and needed a place to crash occasionally. He had his own place but preferred to be with friends for support. I felt really embarrassed and apologized for the misunderstanding. Sarah assured me it was okay, but I still felt awkward about the whole situation.

Some of our mutual friends think it was a sweet gesture and that I did nothing wrong, while others believe I overstepped and should have clarified Alex's living situation before making any assumptions.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's ""guest"" was a permanent resident and buying them a birthday gift?"
38,NAH,"""AITA for letting my partner handle their adult child's emotional baggage, even when it affects our relationship?""","My partner (45M) and I (42F) have been together for five years, and we generally have a great relationship. He has an adult child, Alex (23NB), who has been going through a really tough time recently. Alex has been struggling with anxiety and depression and often leans on their dad for emotional support. 

While I completely understand and support the importance of being there for your children, it's started to affect our relationship. Alex will often call my partner late at night, resulting in him being exhausted the next day. Weekends that we had planned to spend together are sometimes canceled last minute because Alex needs him. I see how much my partner cares about Alex, and I would never want to get in the way of that. 

However, it's becoming difficult for me too. I miss the quality time we used to have, and the constant change in plans is frustrating. I've tried to be supportive and understanding, but I sometimes feel like our relationship is taking a backseat. 

Some friends tell me I need to set boundaries and remind my partner that our relationship is important too. They argue that Alex is an adult and needs to figure out how to handle their issues more independently. On the other hand, others think I'm being too hard and that I should just be more patient and supportive given the circumstances.

My partner and I talked about it, and he feels torn. He wants to be there for Alex, but he also acknowledges that it's straining our relationship. We've tried to find a middle ground, but nothing seems to stick for more than a week.

Now, I'm left wondering if I'm being unreasonable for feeling this way. Am I the asshole for letting my partner handle his adult child's emotional baggage, even when it affects our relationship?

I truly don’t think anyone is in the wrong here, but I can’t help but question if there’s a better way to handle the situation. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?"
39,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my partner would pay for the entire dinner date since they initiated it?""","My partner, Alex (27M), and I (25F) have been dating for about a year. We usually split the bill when we go out, but there have been a few times where one of us has covered the whole expense, usually when it's a special occasion or if one of us is treating the other. Last week, Alex texted me out of the blue and said, ""How about we go out for a nice dinner this Friday? My treat!"" I was thrilled because we've both been really busy with work lately and haven't had much time to just relax and enjoy each other's company.

Friday came, and we went to this amazing new restaurant that just opened up in our city. We ordered appetizers, entrees, dessert, and even a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and we had a great time. When the bill came, however, Alex seemed a bit uneasy. He looked at it, then at me, and said, ""So, how do you want to split this?""

I was taken aback because, based on his earlier text, I had assumed he was going to cover the whole meal. I hesitated and then said, ""Oh, I thought you were treating us tonight?"" He immediately looked embarrassed and apologized, saying he had meant he wanted to treat us to a nice dinner, but he didn't actually mean he'd pay for all of it. 

I could see he was genuinely sorry and flustered, so I quickly offered to split the bill as we usually do. We paid and left without any more awkwardness, but I couldn't help feeling a little confused by the whole situation. Later, Alex admitted that he realized how his wording in the text could have been misleading and apologized again for the misunderstanding.

Some of my friends think that since he initiated the dinner and used the phrase ""my treat,"" he should have paid for the whole thing. But others believe it was just a misunderstanding and that I should have clarified what he meant beforehand. 

There's no lingering tension between Alex and me, and we both laugh about it now, but it did make me wonder about the expectations around who pays for what in a relationship. So, am I the asshole for assuming my partner would pay for the entire dinner date since they initiated it?"
40,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my adult child can afford their own internet and not contributing to the household bill?""","I (55M) have recently moved in with my adult child, Alex (27F), after selling my home to downsize. Alex was gracious enough to offer me a place to stay while I figure out my next steps. She has a stable job and has been living independently for a few years now. I've always considered her to be responsible with her finances.

Since moving in, I've been contributing to household expenses such as groceries and utilities. However, when it came to the internet bill, I assumed Alex could handle it since she already had it set up, and it didn't occur to me that this might be a burden. I use the internet mainly for checking emails and streaming shows occasionally, whereas Alex works from home and uses it more extensively.

Last week, Alex hesitantly approached me and mentioned that the internet bill has gone up recently and asked if I could contribute towards it. I was taken aback and a bit embarrassed because I hadn't factored it into my contributions. I always thought she could manage it since she was already paying for it before I moved in.

I immediately agreed to chip in, but this incident made me realize I might have been naive in my assumptions. I feel guilty for making her come to me about it, and I'm wondering if I should have offered to help with the internet bill right from the start. Some family members think it's no big deal and that Alex could have easily afforded it, while others believe I should have been more considerate given that I'm now using the internet more than before.

Alex isn't upset with me and assured me it was just a misunderstanding, but I can't help but feel bad. I want to make sure I'm not imposing or being inconsiderate. We're both navigating this new living situation, and I want to ensure we're both comfortable and contributing fairly.

So, AITA for assuming my adult child could afford their own internet and not contributing to the household bill initially?"
41,NAH,"AITA for assuming my roommate's ""emergencies"" are just an excuse to borrow money?","I moved in with my roommate, Claire, about six months ago. We met through a mutual friend and hit it off right away. Claire is generally a good roommate—she's clean, respectful, and pretty easy to live with. However, there's been a recurring issue that's starting to bother me.

Since we moved in together, Claire has had three ""emergencies"" that required her to borrow money from me. The first time, her car broke down, and she needed $200 to cover repairs. I didn't hesitate to help her out because, hey, cars breaking down is a real issue. The second time, she claimed her bank account was frozen due to suspected fraud and she needed $150 to tide her over until it was sorted out. Again, I helped because identity theft is serious and can happen to anyone.

But last week, Claire came to me with another emergency—this time, she needed $300 because she said she lost her wallet and had no access to her funds. This one felt a bit fishy to me because she seems to have a new crisis every couple of months.

I talked to a few friends about it, and the opinions were mixed. Some said I should give her the benefit of the doubt, that emergencies do happen and it’s just bad luck. Others felt that I might be getting taken advantage of and that I should be more cautious.

I decided to ask Claire for some kind of proof or even a plan for how she planned to pay me back before lending her the money this time. She got really upset and accused me of not trusting her and making her feel like a burden. She said she had nowhere else to turn and that she thought we were friends.

I feel awful about doubting her, but at the same time, I can't help but wonder if I'm being a sucker. Claire did eventually manage to sort something out without my help, but now things are awkward between us.

In the end, I'm just tired of being put in a position where I feel obligated to lend money without knowing if these emergencies are legitimate. I don't want to damage our relationship, but I also don't want to be taken for a ride.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate's ""emergencies"" are just an excuse to borrow money?"
42,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate would split the utilities based on our agreed-upon income ratio, even though I didn't ask her to?""","I (28F) recently moved in with my roommate, Claire (26F). We've been friends since college and when the opportunity to share an apartment came up, we thought it would be perfect. We agreed to split the rent based on our incomes since I earn significantly more than she does. I make around $80k a year while Claire makes about $40k, so it felt fair to split the rent 60/40. 

Everything was going well until we got our first utility bill. I automatically assumed we would be splitting the utilities the same way we split the rent - 60/40. I didn't bring it up because I thought it was a logical extension of our original agreement. But when the bill arrived, Claire handed me half the amount expecting me to do the same.

I was taken aback and gently brought up our income-based split. Claire looked surprised and said she hadn't realized that would extend to utilities too. She thought our agreement was only about the rent and assumed utilities would be split evenly between us. She apologized for the misunderstanding and seemed genuinely unaware of my assumption.

We discussed it further and I could see her point. Utilities aren't as predictable as rent and can fluctuate based on usage, which might not always be tied to our incomes. Claire also pointed out that she tries to be frugal with utilities, while I tend to run the A/C a bit more and enjoy longer showers. That made sense to me too, and I could see how a 50/50 split might actually be fair in this scenario.

Our friends have mixed opinions. Some think it's reasonable to have the same split for everything, while others agree with Claire that utilities should be 50/50 because they're more usage-based than rent. I don’t think either of us is wrong here, just that we had different expectations. 

As of now, Claire and I have decided to trial the 50/50 split for utilities and see how it goes. We’re also going to keep the lines of communication open to revisit this if it doesn’t feel fair to either of us down the road. 

So, am I the asshole for assuming we’d split the utilities based on our income ratio, even though I didn't specifically ask her to do so?"
43,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my adult child's messy apartment is their responsibility to clean?""","My daughter (24F) recently moved into her own apartment after graduating college and starting a new job. I'm incredibly proud of her for reaching this milestone and becoming independent. We’ve always had a close relationship, so when she invited me over for dinner, I was excited. However, when I arrived, I was quite surprised by the state of her apartment. 

There were dishes piled up in the sink, clothes strewn about the living room, and just an overall mess. I tried not to react visibly because I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but I asked her if everything was okay. She seemed a bit frazzled and told me she'd been working long hours and hasn't had time to tidy up. I understand that adjusting to a full-time job can be overwhelming, so I just nodded and we went on to have dinner.

After I got home, I called her the next day and gently suggested that she might want to set aside some time to clean her apartment. She got defensive and said she was managing the best she could and that it was her space to be how she wanted it. She also mentioned that she felt frustrated that I assumed it was her sole responsibility to handle everything.

I didn’t think much of it until I talked to my husband and some friends about the situation. They had mixed reactions. Some said that as an adult, she should be responsible for maintaining her living space, while others thought I should have offered to help her out instead of just pointing out the problem. 

Now, I’m feeling a bit conflicted. I never meant to make her feel pressured or judged; I just assumed it was part of becoming an adult to take care of one’s own living space. However, I can see how she might have felt overwhelmed and possibly in need of support.

So, is it fair for me to assume that my adult child is solely responsible for cleaning her apartment, or should I have approached it differently? Am I the asshole for thinking it's her responsibility and not offering help?"
44,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'cleaning' efforts mean they'll do the dishes, not just wipe down the counters?""","So, my roommate and I have been living together for about six months now. Overall, it's been a good arrangement, and we generally get along well. But there’s one ongoing issue that’s causing some friction: our different ideas of what “cleaning” means.

I'm someone who likes a clean kitchen. For me, that means not only wiping down counters but also making sure the dishes are done, the sink is clean, and everything is put away. My roommate, on the other hand, seems to think that “cleaning” the kitchen just means wiping down the counters and maybe sweeping the floor. The dishes? Left in the sink, sometimes for days.

For example, last week, I was slammed at work and barely had time to breathe, let alone clean. When I got home one evening, I noticed that the counters were spotless and the floor had been swept. I felt relieved, thinking my roommate had tackled the whole kitchen. But then I saw the sink. It was still piled high with dishes, some of which were mine, but most were his. It was like the countertop fairy had visited but didn’t have time for the sink.

I brought it up gently the next day, saying something like, “Hey, thanks for wiping down the counters and sweeping, but can we also make sure to do the dishes as part of cleaning the kitchen?” He seemed a bit surprised and said he thought he was helping out a lot by doing what he did and that he hates doing dishes more than anything. He suggested a new system where we each take turns doing a full kitchen clean, including the dreaded dishes.

Our mutual friends are divided. Some say I should just appreciate the effort he’s putting in and suck it up about the dishes or take care of them myself since it bothers me more. Others agree that a full kitchen clean should obviously include the dishes and that my roommate needs to step up his game.

Right now, the compromise we've come to is still a bit shaky. We’re both trying, but sometimes the same issues crop up. There hasn’t been a major blow-up, but I can feel the tension building whenever the kitchen is involved. So, AITA for assuming my roommate's 'cleaning' efforts mean they'll do the dishes, not just wipe down the counters?"
45,NAH,"""AITA for not taking my sister's nagging as a personal attack when she has a history of being overly dramatic?""","I've always had a rocky relationship with my sister, Emily (24f). Growing up, she was the type who would always blow things out of proportion and make mountains out of molehills. She's the youngest in our family and, truthfully, has always been a bit more dramatic than the rest of us. Recently, this came to a head again, and I feel conflicted about my reaction.

Last weekend, we had a family barbecue at our parents' house. It was supposed to be a nice, relaxed evening, but Emily was in a mood from the start. She kept nagging me about trivial things — like how I should have brought a different dish or how my shirt wasn't appropriate for the occasion. Honestly, it was all very nitpicky stuff, and it wasn’t new for her. She’s always been like this, finding something to comment on and making it a big deal.

In the past, her nagging has gotten under my skin, and we’ve had our fair share of arguments over it. However, this time, I decided not to let it get to me. I just smiled, nodded, and let her comments roll off my back. To my surprise, my lack of reaction seemed to irritate her even more. She started to escalate, raising her voice and making a scene, which drew the attention of the rest of the family.

Everyone tried to calm her down, but she insisted I was being disrespectful by not taking her seriously. My dad pulled me aside later and said he thought I handled it well, while my mom seemed to think I should have been a bit more considerate of Emily's feelings. My brother, who usually sides with Emily, even said she was being ridiculous this time.

Now, days later, Emily is still giving me the cold shoulder, claiming I always undermine her feelings and don’t take her seriously. I get where she’s coming from, but her constant dramatics make it hard to always be patient and understanding.

So, here I am, wondering if I’m the asshole for not taking her nagging as a personal attack and just trying to keep things calm. Is it my fault for not engaging, or is this just another instance of Emily being overly dramatic? Am I the asshole for trying to maintain my peace without fueling her fire?"
46,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'guest' was just a dude they met on tinder?""","So, I (22F) share an apartment with my roommate, Sam (22M). Sam and I have been friends since freshman year of college, and we decided to get a place together after graduation. We get along pretty well and have a common understanding about respecting each other’s space and privacy.

Last weekend, I came home from work a bit earlier than usual and found a guy sitting in our living room. He looked a bit older, maybe mid-thirties, and it just threw me off because Sam hadn't mentioned having someone over. Now, Sam has had a few 'Tinder dates' over the past year and usually gives me a heads-up so I can avoid any awkward encounters. But this time there was no warning.

So, assuming this was another Tinder date or hookup, I introduced myself to the guy and made a comment like, ""Hey there, another Tinder adventure?"" My tone was more playful than judgmental, but the guy looked totally confused. Sam walked in from his room at that moment, and I could tell something was up by the look on his face. 

Sam quickly clarified that this guy was actually his older cousin, Jake, and that Jake was staying with us for a couple of days because he was in town for a job interview. I felt my face go red with embarrassment and apologized profusely. Sam laughed it off and assured me it was no big deal, but Jake seemed a bit awkward about the whole thing.

Later, I talked to Sam and explained why I made the assumption. He chuckled and admitted that he should’ve told me about Jake beforehand, especially since I was coming home early. We both laughed about the mix-up, but I can't shake off the feeling that I might have crossed a line with my assumption and the way I brought it up.

I’ve been overthinking it and wondering if I made an ass of myself in front of Sam’s cousin. Sam says it's all cool, and Jake didn’t seem upset when I apologized again later, but I still feel bad about the whole thing.

Was I the asshole for assuming my roommate’s guest was just a guy he met on Tinder without asking first?"
47,NAH,AITA for assuming my roommate was just being lazy and not helping with household chores?,"I live with my roommate, Alex, in a two-bedroom apartment. We've been friends since college and decided to move in together to save on rent and expenses. Everything was going smoothly for the first few months, but recently I've noticed that Alex hasn't been helping much with the household chores.

At first, I thought he was just being lazy. The sink was always full of dishes, the trash wouldn't get taken out, and the living room looked like a tornado had hit it. I mentioned it a few times, and he always seemed to have an excuse—long hours at work, feeling under the weather, or just forgetting. I started getting frustrated and felt like I was carrying the weight of maintaining the apartment on my own.

One evening, I confronted Alex about it. I told him it felt unfair that I was doing most of the cleaning and that he needed to step up. He looked genuinely surprised and then broke down. He revealed that he had been going through a really tough time mentally. Work has been incredibly stressful, and he's been dealing with anxiety and depression, which he hadn't told me about. His lack of participation in chores wasn't because he was lazy; he was struggling to keep up with everything in his life.

I felt terrible for not noticing what he was going through. I apologized for assuming the worst and not being more supportive. Alex appreciated my apology and said he should have communicated better about his mental health struggles.

Since then, we've had a long talk about how we can better support each other. We've come up with a plan to divide chores more fairly, considering his current situation. I also encouraged him to seek professional help, and he's looking into therapy. Our mutual friends and families have mixed opinions—some think I was too hard on him, while others believe he should have communicated his struggles sooner.

Overall, we're trying to work through this together with more understanding and care. So, Reddit, AITA for assuming my roommate was just being lazy and not helping with household chores?"
48,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'guest' is actually their new significant other?""","I (24F) live with my roommate, Sarah (25F), and we’ve been sharing an apartment for about a year and a half now. We get along pretty well, and we’ve always tried to respect each other’s privacy and space. One of the few rules we have is to give a heads-up if one of us is having guests over, just to avoid any unexpected surprises.

A couple of weeks ago, Sarah started having this guy, Mark, over quite regularly. At first, I thought nothing of it; she has friends over sometimes, just like I do. But then, Mark started spending more and more time at our place. He would crash on our couch, be there in the mornings when I got up, and even join us for meals. Naturally, I assumed he was her new boyfriend and relaxed some of the rules I usually stick to when it’s just Sarah and me.

A few nights ago, we were all sitting together in the living room, and I made a casual comment about how it’s nice having her boyfriend around. Both Sarah and Mark looked at me with wide eyes and then burst out laughing. Sarah quickly corrected me and explained that Mark is actually an old friend who needed a place to stay temporarily due to some issues with his apartment lease.

I felt incredibly embarrassed and apologized, explaining that I genuinely thought they were dating because of how much time they were spending together and how comfortable they seemed with one another. Sarah assured me it was an honest mistake, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I overstepped. We all laughed it off, but I caught myself thinking I might have invaded Sarah’s privacy by making assumptions about her personal life.

When I told some of our mutual friends about what happened, their reactions were mixed. Some said it was a natural mistake and nothing to worry about, while others thought I should have directly asked Sarah about Mark’s presence instead of assuming. 

Now, things are a bit awkward between Sarah, Mark, and me. I’m trying to make up for my assumption by giving them more space and being extra courteous, but I still feel a bit off. 

Was it really a big deal for me to assume Mark was Sarah’s new boyfriend, or am I overthinking this? Am I the asshole for jumping to conclusions about their relationship?"
49,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'emergency' was just a bad hangover and not letting them sleep over?""","I (24M) live with my roommate, Sam (23F). We've been friends since college and decided to get an apartment together after we both graduated. Sam is known for her partying and often comes back home pretty late, sometimes in less than stellar condition. We're usually good about giving each other space, and we have an understanding that we handle our own messes.

Last weekend, I had a particularly brutal week at work and was looking forward to relaxing on Friday night. Sam went out with her friends as usual, and I stayed in, binge-watching a show and catching up on much-needed sleep. Around 3 AM, my phone started ringing. It was Sam, sounding pretty distressed. She said she wasn't feeling well and asked if she could crash in my room.

In my half-asleep state, I immediately assumed she was just drunk and hungover, as this has happened before. I told her that she should just go to her room and sleep it off. She insisted, but I was exhausted and firm about needing my space to rest. Eventually, she said okay and hung up. I went back to sleep.

The next morning, I found out that Sam had been taken to the hospital. It turns out she had a severe allergic reaction to something she ate and was genuinely in need of help. She had managed to call another friend who took her to the emergency room. I felt awful for not recognizing the seriousness of her situation.

Sam’s been cool about it, understanding that it was an honest mistake given her usual behavior. But some mutual friends think I should have known better and been more supportive, while others agree that it was just an unfortunate misunderstanding. Sam herself has reassured me that she's not holding it against me, but I can't shake the guilt.

Since then, we've talked it out and decided to come up with a better way to communicate emergencies in the future, so something like this doesn't happen again. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's 'emergency' was just a bad hangover and not letting them sleep over?

TL;DR: Assumed my roommate was hungover and didn't let her crash in my room, turned out she had a severe allergic reaction and needed help."

We've been living together for about six months now and generally get along pretty well. We both go to the same university, and while we have different majors, we share a lot of the same friends and interests. Living together has mostly been smooth sailing, except for one recurring issue: her dirty laundry.

Sarah has a habit of doing her laundry in the evening when she gets back from classes. Our schedules are pretty hectic, so it's understandable that sometimes she might be distracted or rushed. However, for the fifth time now, she's left her dirty laundry on my bed. Each time, she apologizes profusely and says it was an accident — that she was in a hurry or thought she was putting it on her bed, not mine.

The first couple of times, I let it slide because we all make mistakes, and I wanted to be understanding. But by the fourth and fifth time, it started to really bother me. Yesterday, after a long day of classes and work, I came home to find yet another pile of her dirty laundry on my bed. I kind of snapped and told her that this has to stop. I wasn’t yelling, but I was clearly frustrated. Sarah apologized again and said she didn’t mean to do it, but I could see she was a bit hurt by my reaction.

Our mutual friends have mixed opinions. Some say I should be more understanding since it’s clearly accidental and she’s not doing it on purpose. Others think Sarah needs to be more considerate and mindful of where she’s putting her stuff. As for me, I feel conflicted. I understand that accidents happen, but five times feels like a pattern rather than a one-off mistake.

The fallout from this latest incident is that there's now a bit of tension between us. Sarah has been more withdrawn, and I feel guilty for not being more patient. However, I also feel like my personal space is being repeatedly invaded, and it’s becoming a source of stress for me.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not being super understanding when my roommate ‘accidentally’ leaves her dirty laundry on my bed for the fifth time?"
51,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate would take care of the pets while I'm on vacation?""","I (26F) recently went on a week-long vacation, which I had been planning for months. I live with my roommate, Jess (25F), and we share an apartment. We've been living together for about a year and generally get along well. We both have our own pets: I have a cat named Whiskers, and Jess has a small dog named Max. We've always informally helped each other out with pet care when needed, like if one of us is running late or has a long workday. 

Before my vacation, I mentioned to Jess that I was leaving and casually asked if she could keep an eye on Whiskers while I was gone. She nodded and said, ""Sure, no problem."" I didn't think much of it and thought everything was set. I didn't leave any detailed instructions or make any formal arrangements because I assumed she knew the drill – just feed Whiskers and clean the litter box daily.

When I got back, I noticed that Whiskers seemed a bit out of sorts. The litter box was cleaner than I expected, and the food bowl was full, so I guessed that Jess had indeed taken care of things. However, when I asked Jess how it went, she seemed a bit annoyed and said it was a hassle. She then mentioned she had a busy week herself and didn't appreciate having to take on extra responsibilities without proper notice. 

I felt bad and apologized, but I also felt a bit confused. Given our history of helping each other out and her initial agreement, I didn't think it would be an issue. Some of our mutual friends have mixed opinions – a couple of them think I should have been more explicit and considerate in my request, while others believe Jess could have been more understanding since we've both helped each other before.

As of now, things are a bit tense between us. Jess is still a little standoffish, and I feel guilty for assuming she'd be okay with it. I also feel a bit hurt because I thought we had a mutual understanding about helping each other out.

52,NAH,"""AITA for letting my roommate's constant snoozing and absence from our shared schedule slide?""","I (26f) live with my roommate, Hannah (25f). We've been friends since college and decided to move in together about a year ago. We have a pretty good dynamic overall, but there's one issue that's been bothering me and I'm not sure if I'm handling it the right way.

Hannah has a bad habit of hitting the snooze button on her alarm multiple times each morning. She does this at least three or four times before she actually gets out of bed. Our bedrooms are right next to each other, and her alarm is loud enough that it wakes me up every time it goes off. I've asked her a couple of times if she could try to limit the snoozing because it disrupts my sleep, but she hasn't really made any changes.

On top of that, we have a shared schedule for household chores, grocery shopping, and other responsibilities. Hannah tends to slack off on her share of the chores and often forgets to pick up groceries when it's her turn. I've been letting it slide because I know she's been really busy and stressed with work lately. She's getting up early because she has to be at work by 7 AM, whereas I work from home and have a more flexible schedule.

Our mutual friends have mixed opinions on this. Some say that I'm being too lenient and that I should be more assertive about the snoozing and her missed responsibilities. Others understand that she's going through a tough time and think I'm being a good friend by cutting her some slack.

Despite my efforts to be understanding, it's starting to wear on me. I've been picking up the slack on the chores and groceries more often than not, and I feel constantly sleep-deprived from her alarms. I haven't addressed this with her recently because I don't want to add to her stress, but I also feel like my patience is running thin. 

Our living situation isn't unbearable, and I don't want to risk our friendship over this, but I also feel like my needs are being neglected. 

So, am I the asshole for letting my roommate's constant snoozing and absence from our shared schedule slide?"
53,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate is paying their share of the rent on time?""","Three months ago, I moved into a new place with my college friend, Alex. We both graduated recently and found a two-bedroom apartment that fit our budget. It’s our first time living together, and things have been mostly good. We split rent and utilities down the middle, and everything is in both our names.

When we signed the lease, we agreed to a system where we'd each transfer our half of the rent to a joint account by the 1st of each month. The landlord then withdraws the full amount from that account on the 3rd. For the past couple of months, it’s been pretty seamless.

Last week, I got an unexpected call from the landlord saying our rent payment hadn't been received, and a late fee had been added. Confused, I checked the joint account and saw that Alex’s half of the rent wasn't there. I immediately transferred the full amount from my personal savings to cover it and avoid further penalties.

When I confronted Alex, he apologized profusely and said he had some unexpected expenses and couldn't transfer his half on time. He promised to pay me back but asked for a couple of weeks to get the money together. He explained that some emergency came up, and he’s been struggling a bit financially. I had no idea since he never mentioned anything before. I told him it’s fine, but we need to communicate better to avoid issues like this.

I then mentioned this incident to some friends, and reactions were mixed. Some said it's my fault for assuming he’d always have the money and not checking the account myself. Others say Alex should have told me sooner and apologized for not communicating his financial issues.

Now, Alex has been working extra hours to pay me back, and our relationship is a bit strained. I feel like neither of us is completely at fault here. We’re both just trying to navigate this adulting thing and make ends meet.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate is paying their share of the rent on time?"
54,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's weird smell is just their weird food choices?""","I (24F) live with my roommate Liz (23F). We've been sharing an apartment for about a year now. Liz is really into trying out different exotic cuisines, and she's always cooking something new in the kitchen. It's pretty cool, but some of the foods she makes have very strong and unique smells. I've gotten used to it and actually find it interesting most of the time.

A couple of weeks ago, I started noticing a strange smell in our apartment. At first, I assumed it was just another one of Liz's experimental dishes. Sometimes she uses ingredients that I've never even heard of, and they tend to have very distinct odors. So, I didn't think much of it and just tried to ignore it.

However, the smell kept getting stronger and more unpleasant. I didn't want to confront Liz about it because I didn't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like she couldn't cook her favorite foods. Plus, we've always had a good relationship and I didn't want to create any tension between us. I just assumed it was a phase and the smell would eventually go away.

It wasn't until a few days ago that things took a turn. I came home from work and the smell was overpowering. I couldn't ignore it anymore. I decided to check around the apartment to see if I could find the source. To my surprise, I found a pile of dirty clothes hidden in a corner of Liz's room. It looked like they had been there for a while.

I gently brought it up to Liz, and she was really embarrassed. She explained that she had been going through a rough time at work and had been too stressed out to keep up with laundry. She thanked me for not jumping to conclusions and for being understanding. We cleaned up the mess together and she promised to be more diligent about housekeeping.

Our friends have mixed opinions about how I handled the situation. Some of them think I should have addressed the smell sooner and directly asked Liz about it. Others believe it was reasonable to assume it was just her cooking, given her culinary habits. 

Liz and I have talked it through and we're on good terms. There's no lingering tension or hard feelings, but the incident has left me wondering if I should have acted differently.

55,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'lost' laptop was actually just a bad password?""","So, here's what happened. I (22F) live with my roommate Claire (23F) in a small apartment. We’ve been living together for about a year, and we generally get along well. Claire is not very tech-savvy, and I often help her out with her computer issues. Last week, Claire came to me in a panic, saying her laptop wouldn’t turn on. She had an important project due, and she was freaking out.

I asked her if she had tried the usual stuff - checking the power cable, holding down the power button, etc. She said she did everything but nothing worked. I figured it was something simple, like maybe a dead battery or a bad connection. I tried to turn it on, and it was completely unresponsive. So, we assumed it was a hardware issue.

Since Claire was so stressed about her project, I offered to let her use my laptop for the time being, and she gratefully accepted. Fast forward a few days: I was rearranging some stuff in the living room and accidentally knocked Claire’s laptop off the table. When I picked it up and pressed the power button, lo and behold, it powered on! But then it asked for her password, which she seemed to have forgotten. 

I tried a few obvious passwords like her birthday and pet’s name, and I managed to unlock it on the third try. Turns out, the whole issue was that Claire had been locked out because she forgot her password and panicked, thinking her laptop was broken.

When Claire came home, I told her what happened, expecting her to laugh it off. Instead, she got a bit upset, saying that I should have been more supportive and understanding rather than assuming she had just messed up the password. She felt embarrassed about the whole thing and said she would have preferred figuring it out herself.

The thing is, I genuinely thought I was helping, especially with her project being so important. Our mutual friends have mixed opinions—some say I should have been more patient and trusted her judgment, while others think she overreacted and should be grateful I solved the issue.

Now, things are a bit awkward between us. Claire’s been avoiding using my laptop and is super hesitant about asking for help with tech issues now. I never meant to embarrass her, and I feel bad about it.

So, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's 'lost' laptop was actually just a bad password and fixing it without consulting her first?"
56,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate would've helped me move without me asking?""","So, I (23F) recently moved into a new apartment. My roommate, Sarah (24F), and I have been living together for about a year and have always gotten along well. We've always been there for each other, like lending a hand with chores or running errands when one of us is swamped. I guess I just assumed that helping each other out was part of our unspoken agreement.

Anyway, last weekend, I had to move a bunch of heavy stuff from my old place to the new one. I figured Sarah would offer to help since she didn't have any major plans, and honestly, she’s always been great about pitching in. But when the time came, she made herself scarce. I didn't specifically ask her for help, thinking it was understood that she’d jump in like I would for her.

I ended up struggling a lot on my own and had to hire a last-minute moving service, which was pretty expensive. I was kind of hurt and frustrated, so I brought it up with her later. She looked genuinely surprised and a bit guilty, but then she said, ""I honestly thought you had it covered since you didn't ask for help."" She explained that she had actually been dealing with some personal stuff and was really stressed out, and she didn't want to impose or get in my way, thinking I might have already had a plan.

Some of our mutual friends had mixed reactions. A few of them think I'm being unreasonable, saying I should've just asked directly if I needed help. Others feel like Sarah should've at least offered since we’re roommates and help each other out all the time.

Sarah and I talked it out, and we're good now, but I still can't shake the feeling that maybe I was wrong to assume she'd help without asking. She’s been super nice and even baked me cookies to make up for it, which makes me feel even worse.

57,NAH,"AITA for assuming my roommate's ""no cooking"" rule is only applicable to meat-based meals?","I (22F) recently moved into a new apartment with my roommate, Sarah (24F). We didn't know each other before moving in, but we hit it off quickly and have been living together for about two months now. Sarah is a strict vegetarian, and while I mostly follow a vegetarian diet, I do occasionally eat meat. When we first moved in, Sarah mentioned that she has a ""no cooking meat"" rule because the smell makes her feel nauseous, which I totally understood and agreed to.

The incident occurred last week. One evening, I decided to cook a vegetable stir-fry with some tofu. I was careful to use my own cookware and keep the kitchen clean. While I was cooking, Sarah came home and immediately seemed stressed. She asked me why I was cooking, and I reminded her that it was a vegetarian meal. She sighed and said, ""I thought we agreed on no cooking."" That's when I realized she might have meant no cooking at all, not just no meat.

I apologized right away and explained that I had assumed the rule applied specifically to meat-based meals. She seemed to understand but looked a bit frustrated. She said that she prefers to keep the kitchen as clean and smell-free as possible and that cooking in general tends to create lingering odors that she finds unpleasant, even if it's just vegetables.

I felt really bad because I genuinely thought I was respecting her boundaries by not cooking meat. To make it up to her, I offered to open the windows and air out the kitchen to get rid of any lingering smells, and I told her I’d be happy to discuss a better arrangement for future cooking. Sarah accepted my apology and seemed to appreciate my willingness to compromise.

Since then, I've been more cautious about cooking and have mostly stuck to making cold meals or ordering takeout when I don't feel like eating raw foods. However, a few friends I talked to think Sarah's request is a bit unreasonable and that I shouldn’t have to completely stop cooking in my own apartment.

Sarah and I are still on good terms, but I can't help but feel a little conflicted. I don't want to upset her, but I also miss the freedom to cook meals, even if they're vegetarian. So, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's ""no cooking"" rule was only applicable to meat-based meals?"
58,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate is just being dramatic about their roommate move-out notice?""","I (24F) have been living with my roommate, Jess (25F), for about two years now. We met through a mutual friend and have generally gotten along well. Both of us share the rent, and we have a pretty even distribution of household chores. Jess is a bit more of an introverted person and tends to keep to herself, especially when stressed out. Recently, she has started acting really nervous and on edge, and it was affecting the whole vibe of our apartment.

A couple of weeks ago, Jess handed me a move-out notice and explained that she had to move out in a month. She was visibly shaken and seemed almost panicked while telling me. Initially, I assumed she was just being overly dramatic or anxious about the idea of moving, as Jess does tend to worry about changes and new situations. I thought she might be overthinking the situation, and I didn't really take her anxiety as seriously as I probably should have.

I casually mentioned to some friends about Jess’s move-out notice and how she seemed so upset about it. To my surprise, they were sympathetic toward Jess and suggested that maybe something serious was going on in her life that she hadn't shared with me. They advised me to have a more serious conversation with her to understand her side better.

Taking their advice, I finally sat down with Jess and asked her what was really going on. She then opened up about how she had lost her job unexpectedly and couldn’t afford the rent anymore. On top of that, she had been dealing with some family issues that required her to move back home for support. This information completely changed my perspective, and I felt terrible for not realizing how much she had been struggling.

As it stands now, Jess is set to move out at the end of the month, and I am in the process of looking for a new roommate. The atmosphere in the apartment is a bit tense, but we’re both trying to make the best of the situation. I wish I had understood her distress earlier and had been more supportive from the beginning.

We're both in our mid-20s and this is the first time either of us has had this level of independence. We get along well, and so far, living together has been pretty smooth.

A few weeks ago, I mentioned that I wanted to get an air fryer because I heard they make cooking easier and healthier. To my surprise, Alex showed up one day with a brand-new air fryer and said it was a 'gift' for us to use in the apartment. I was really touched because it was a nice gesture, and I thanked him profusely.

However, a few days later, I overheard Alex talking to his mom on the phone, saying something about ""finally picking up the air fryer she didn't need anymore."" Putting two and two together, I assumed the air fryer wasn't actually ""new"" but rather a hand-me-down from his mom. I didn't think much of it at first, but it started to bother me. I felt a bit deceived, like he was trying to make himself look good without being completely honest.

I confronted Alex about it, not angrily, but I did ask if the air fryer was indeed from his mom. He admitted it was but seemed confused as to why it mattered. I told him that while I appreciated the gesture, I would have preferred honesty about where it came from. Alex got defensive and said he didn't think it was a big deal and that it was still a 'gift' either way. After that, things got a bit awkward between us, and now there's this weird tension in the apartment.

When I told some friends about it, they were split. Some thought I was overreacting and that a gift is a gift, regardless of where it came from. Others felt like Alex should have been upfront. As for Alex, he’s been keeping to himself more, and I can tell he’s upset that I confronted him about what he thought was a kind gesture.

I really didn’t mean to cause any drama and now I’m second-guessing if I should have just let it slide. It’s not like the air fryer is any less useful or appreciated, but I just didn't like the idea of feeling misled.

So, am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's 'gift' of a new air fryer was actually just a hand-me-down from their mom?"
60,NAH,"AITA for being okay with my partner's decision to keep their expensive, unused engagement ring?","My partner and I have been together for five years, and we’re planning to get married soon. A few years ago, they were previously engaged to someone else but ended up calling it off. They had bought a really expensive engagement ring for their ex, which has been sitting in a box ever since.

Recently, we had a conversation about what to do with the ring. A mutual friend suggested selling it and using the money to put towards our wedding or future expenses, but my partner seemed reluctant. They said the ring had some sentimental value, as it represented a significant part of their life, despite things not working out. Plus, they mentioned it felt like a waste to just sell it off, given how much it cost.

Personally, I’m okay with them keeping the ring. I understand it’s something that holds meaning for them, even if it’s from a past relationship. I don’t feel threatened or upset by it, and I trust that their feelings for me are genuine and strong. However, our friend group has mixed opinions. Some think it’s weird or inappropriate for them to hold onto it, while others agree that it’s their choice and not a big deal.

So far, the ring has had no impact on our relationship; it simply stays in a drawer. My partner and I have discussed it openly and are on the same page about its significance—or lack thereof—in our current relationship. There have been no arguments or issues stemming from this decision.

In conclusion, I don’t see any harm in them keeping the ring, and they feel more at peace having it. Am I the asshole for being okay with my partner’s decision to keep their expensive, unused engagement ring?"

To give some context, Laura has always been very generous, and she has a high-paying job that allows her to indulge in such extravagant purchases. On the other hand, I have a more modest income and usually don't spend that kind of money on gifts.

When I opened the present, I was genuinely shocked and grateful. I thanked Laura profusely and expressed how much I loved the gift, but I didn't make a huge fuss about its price because it felt awkward. While I appreciated the gesture, part of me felt uncomfortable accepting something so expensive, and I didn't want to create a scene that might make others feel awkward or highlight the disparity between our financial situations.

Some of our mutual friends who were at the party seemed to pick up on my subdued reaction. Later, a few of them mentioned that I should have been more enthusiastic and made a bigger deal out of the gift. They've been jokingly calling me ""ungrateful,"" but I can sense there's a bit of seriousness behind their words. They think Laura might feel like her generosity wasn't fully appreciated.

I talked to Laura afterward and thanked her again, assuring her that I truly loved the watch. She seemed fine and told me she didn't expect any grand reaction; she just wanted to give me something nice for my milestone birthday. However, the comments from our friends have left me second-guessing my actions.

I really didn't mean to seem ungrateful, but I also didn’t want to make Laura feel weird or embarrass her by overly fixating on the price of the gift. Did I handle this poorly?

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not making a big fuss about my friend's ridiculously expensive gift to me?"
62,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate pays for their own Netflix subscription after the free trial ended?""","I (22F) live with my roommate, Alex (24M), and we've been sharing an apartment for about a year now. We get along really well and have a pretty good system for sharing expenses like rent, utilities, and groceries. One of the things we both enjoy is watching Netflix, and when we first moved in together, Alex mentioned that he found a free trial for Netflix and signed up.

The trial period was for a month, and we both made the most of it, binge-watching shows together and having movie nights. When the trial ended, I assumed Alex would either cancel the subscription or start paying for it himself, especially since he was the one who signed up for it in the first place. I never asked him about it, and he never brought it up either.

Fast forward a few months, and we were still using Netflix regularly. I assumed Alex had decided to pay for the subscription and was okay with it since he never mentioned needing help with the cost. I didn't really think much of it until a few weeks ago when we were talking about splitting the cost of some new furniture for the living room. Out of the blue, Alex asked if I could start chipping in for the Netflix subscription since we've both been using it.

I was taken aback because I genuinely thought he was already covering it on his own. I told him I had no problem splitting the cost going forward, but I was a bit surprised he hadn't mentioned it sooner. He seemed a bit annoyed and said he thought it was understood that we'd both pay for it after the trial ended.

We had a calm conversation about it, and I explained that I just assumed he was okay with covering it since he never brought it up until now. He admitted he should have mentioned it earlier, and we both agreed to split the cost from now on. There's no lingering tension, but I can't help but feel a bit guilty for not offering to pay sooner.

Our friends have mixed opinions about the situation. Some think Alex should have communicated better, while others think I should have offered to help with the cost sooner. We both understand each other's perspective, but I'm still wondering:

Am I the asshole for assuming my roommate pays for their own Netflix subscription after the free trial ended?"
63,NAH,"AITA for assuming my roommate's loud music is okay since they ""said it's fine"" over text?","I (24F) recently moved in with a new roommate, Sam (26M), and we're still figuring out each other's boundaries and habits. Sam is generally pretty easygoing, and we get along well. One of the main issues we've been dealing with is noise levels. Sam likes to play music pretty loudly when he's home, especially on weekends. I didn't mind it much initially, but then I started to notice it was interfering with my ability to work from home and relax in my downtime.

A few weeks ago, Sam was out of town for a weekend, and I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to catch up on some work and also play my own music without worrying about bothering anyone. I texted Sam to ask if it was okay if I played my music loudly since he wasn't there to be disturbed, and he responded with, ""Yeah, it's fine.""

So, I cranked up the volume and had a productive and enjoyable weekend. When Sam returned, I casually mentioned that I had played my music loud while he was away, and he raised an eyebrow but didn't say much.

This past weekend, I figured it would be alright to do the same because of that earlier text exchange. I didn't bother asking Sam again since I assumed his stance hadn't changed. However, Sam came home earlier than expected and seemed quite irritated. He snapped at me, saying that he could hear the music from the hallway and asked why I didn't bother checking if it was still okay. I reminded him of his earlier text, and he just sighed and said, ""I didn't mean forever.""

Later, when things calmed down, we talked about it more rationally. Sam explained that while he's generally fine with loud music when he's not around, it would be better to check each time since he might come home early or have other plans that require a quieter environment. I apologized and said I understood better now, and we agreed to be more communicative about noise levels.

Our friends are split on the issue. Some think I should have known better and checked every time, while others say Sam could have been clearer about his expectations. Sam and I aren't holding grudges, but I can't help but wonder if I was out of line. 

Am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's loud music is okay since they ""said it's fine"" over text?"
64,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate knows how to do their own laundry?""","So, I (23F) recently moved in with a new roommate, Alex (22M). We both work in the same company and decided it would be a good idea to share an apartment to save on rent and commute together. Alex is generally a great guy—kind, funny, and responsible at work. We get along well, and the living arrangement seemed perfect until this incident.

One weekend, I noticed that Alex had a huge pile of laundry building up in his room. He comes from a well-off family and mentioned that he had never really done chores growing up because they had house help. But, considering we're both adults, I assumed that he knew how to do basic things like laundry. It didn't occur to me that he might need help or a tutorial on using the washing machine.

After a particularly busy week, I decided to do a load of laundry on Saturday. While I was sorting through my clothes in the laundry room, Alex walked in with his basket and looked a bit lost. I asked if he was about to do his laundry, and he hesitated before admitting that he had never done it before and didn't know where to start. I was a bit surprised but said, ""No worries, it's pretty straightforward. Just separate the whites and colors, and follow the instructions on the machine.""

I quickly showed him the basics, and he seemed to get the hang of it. However, the next day, it became clear that he had washed everything together, resulting in some of his clothes getting ruined. He wasn't angry or anything, but he was visibly disappointed and frustrated. He mumbled something about how he wished he had asked more detailed questions or done some research beforehand.

Later, he mentioned this incident to our mutual friends, who had varying opinions. Some thought it was a bit clueless of him not to know how to do his laundry at this age, given he could easily Google it. Others felt I should have offered more detailed assistance, considering I knew he had never done it before.

In the aftermath, Alex and I are still getting along fine, but there's been an awkwardness hanging in the air. He hasn't brought up the laundry situation again, but I feel a little guilty for assuming he knew more than he did and not offering more help after showing him the basics.

So, AITA for assuming my roommate knows how to do their own laundry?"
65,NAH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate's 'lost' keys are actually just hiding in plain sight?""","So, my roommate (24f) and I (25f) have been living together for a little over a year now, and generally, we get along pretty well. However, she has a habit of misplacing things, especially her keys. Every time she ""loses"" them, it seems like a mini-crisis and she gets really anxious about it.

Last week, she came storming into the apartment after work, clearly stressed, and announced her keys were missing again. She was almost in tears, saying she couldn’t find them anywhere. I was in the middle of cooking dinner, and given our history with her misplacing things, I just felt like I knew what was coming.

Without making a big deal out of it, I suggested, ""Have you checked the kitchen counter?"" because that's usually where she leaves them. She snapped back at me, visibly frustrated, and said she had already looked everywhere. I decided not to push it and continued with dinner while she kept searching.

After about 15 minutes of frantic searching, she found her keys—exactly where I had suggested, on the kitchen counter, under some mail. She didn’t say anything immediately, but I could tell she was both relieved and slightly embarrassed. I tried to lighten the mood by joking, ""The keys always seem to be hiding in plain sight!"" She didn't respond and went straight to her room.

She’s been kind of distant since then, not really engaging in our usual roommate banter. I talked to a mutual friend about it, and she said I might have come off as dismissive and that my joke could have made her feel even worse, especially since she was already stressed.

I didn’t mean to be flippant or make her feel bad; I was just trying to ease the tension. Now I’m worried I’ve upset her more than I realized. 

Am I the asshole for assuming my roommate's ""lost"" keys are actually just hiding in plain sight and possibly making her feel worse about losing them? I genuinely thought I was helping and trying to make her laugh."
66,ESH,"""AITA for letting my partner's ridiculous expectations ruin our family gatherings?""","I (m35) have been with my partner (f34) for over five years now. We have a pretty strong relationship overall, but there has always been this one issue that comes up during family gatherings. She has some pretty strict and, to be honest, borderline ridiculous expectations when it comes to hosting events. 

For context, I come from a laid-back family where gatherings are about hanging out, eating good food, catching up, and just enjoying each other's company. My partner, on the other hand, grew up in a household where everything had to be perfect—elaborate meals, the house spotless, everyone dressed up, and specific activities planned out for different parts of the evening.

Our first joint family gathering at our house was a disaster. She spent days cleaning, cooking, and even hired a decorator to make everything look ""just right."" My family, used to our casual get-togethers, showed up in jeans and brought some potluck-style dishes. She was visibly upset the entire evening, making everyone uncomfortable. After they left, she went on about how my family ""embarrassed"" her by not adhering to the ""standard."" I tried to explain that my family just doesn't operate that way, but it didn't help.

Every family gathering since has been tense. My partner insists on maintaining her expectations, and I find myself caught in the middle, trying to appease both sides. My family feels like they need to walk on eggshells, and I don't blame them. They even suggested having gatherings at their place instead to avoid the whole ordeal. 

Recently, it came to a head when my partner and I hosted a family BBQ. My partner went all out again, preparing a gourmet spread and fussing over every detail. My family, in true fashion, brought casual dishes and dressed comfortably. My partner pulled me aside multiple times to complain about how their ""lack of effort"" was ruining everything. At one point, my sister overheard and felt so awkward she left early, which deeply hurt me.

After everyone left, we had a huge argument. I told her she needed to relax and lower her expectations because not everyone shares her views on what a family gathering should be. She countered by saying I should support her standards and insist my family follow them if they respect us. Things went downhill from there, with harsh words exchanged on both sides. Now, my family doesn't want to come over anymore, and my partner feels unloved and unsupported.

My friends are divided. Some say I'm right to ask her to tone it down, while others think I should better communicate her standards to my family. My partner’s friends side with her, claiming I should step up and manage my family better.

So, am I the asshole for letting my partner's ridiculous expectations ruin our family gatherings?"
67,ESH,"""AITA for telling my parents to stop paying my bills when I'm 25 and 'faking' adult life?""","I (25F) have been living on my own for a few years now, but my parents still cover a lot of my bills—rent, utilities, even my car payments. They insisted on doing this because they want me to save money and get ahead in life. I appreciate their help, but it makes me feel like I’m not truly independent. 

A few weeks ago, I decided it was time to take control of my own finances, so I told my parents I wanted them to stop paying my bills. I said I need to learn how to manage my money and handle adult responsibilities just like everyone else. They got upset and said I was being ungrateful, pointing out how much they’ve sacrificed to support me. 

We had a heated argument where I accused them of infantilizing me and preventing me from growing up. My mom started crying, saying they’re only trying to help and that I’m throwing their generosity back in their faces. My dad got really quiet and distant, which is how he reacts when he’s angry. They told me if I wanted to be an ""independent adult"" so badly, then I could figure everything out on my own from that point onward. 

Since then, they’ve cut me off completely. I struggled to make ends meet the first month without their support, and I had to take on a second job to cover everything. My friends think I did the right thing by standing up for myself, but my grandparents are furious with me, saying I disrespected my parents and didn’t appreciate their help.

As a result, my relationship with my parents is strained. They won't even pick up my calls. They’ve withdrawn from me completely, and now I’m questioning if I was too harsh or if I should have handled it differently. 

Was I in the wrong for insisting on paying my own bills and calling them out, or were they keeping me from growing up by being overly generous? Am I the asshole for telling my parents to stop paying my bills when I'm 25 and 'faking' adult life? 

Edit: For clarification, I do love my parents and appreciate what they have done for me. I just wanted to be independent."
68,ESH,"""AITA for refusing to foot the bill for my sister's expensive vacation after she invited herself to stay with me for a month?""","My sister, Emma, and I have always had a complicated relationship. It's not that we don’t love each other, but we’ve never really seen eye to eye on many things. I'm more of a planner and saver, while Emma tends to live life in the moment, often without considering the financial consequences.

Earlier this year, Emma called me out of the blue and announced that she was going to stay with me for a month. She said she needed a change of scenery and thought my place would be perfect since I live in a city she’s always wanted to explore. She didn’t really ask if it was okay; she just stated it as a fact. I was taken aback but didn’t want to cause a rift, so I reluctantly agreed.

When Emma arrived, it quickly became apparent that her idea of a “change of scenery” was a full-blown vacation—with me as her personal tour guide and financier. She had grand plans to visit all the tourist spots, dine at fancy restaurants, and go on shopping sprees. I realized she was expecting me to foot the bill for everything, even though she didn’t contribute a single dollar towards rent or groceries during her stay.

About halfway through her visit, I told Emma we needed to talk. I explained that I couldn’t afford to pay for all the activities she wanted to do and suggested we either scale back on the expensive outings or that she pitch in for the costs. She got defensive and accused me of ruining her vacation. She argued that since she was staying with me, it was only fair that I take care of her expenses. This led to a nasty argument where hurtful things were said on both sides.

My friends and family have mixed opinions. Some say I should have set clearer boundaries from the start and that it was unfair of me to let her come with expectations I couldn’t meet. Others think Emma was being entitled and unreasonable in expecting me to finance her entire trip. 

As a result of our argument, Emma cut her stay short and went back home. We haven’t spoken much since. I feel guilty because I could have been more upfront about my financial limitations, but I also feel taken advantage of.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to finance my sister’s expensive vacation after she invited herself to stay with me for a month?"
69,ESH,"""AITA for assuming my family would be okay with me taking a 6-month break from social media?""","I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with social media lately, and I decided that a 6-month break would be a good way to clear my mind and focus on my work and personal life. I’ve always been the kind of person who shares everything online – from daily updates to big announcements – and my family is used to keeping up with my life through my posts. 

A few weeks ago, I made the decision to deactivate my accounts without telling anyone in advance. I didn’t think it was a big deal since I could always reach them through calls or texts if needed. However, I didn’t realize how much my family relied on my social media updates.

The incident came to a head when my cousin was getting married, and I didn’t see the event posted on social media. I didn’t attend, and everyone was upset with me for not being there. My cousin was hurt, thinking I didn’t care enough to show up for her big day. I tried explaining that I wasn’t aware of the wedding because I’d deactivated my accounts, but it only made things worse.

My family also pointed out that they missed out on important updates from me, like career changes and personal achievements, and felt left out of my life. My sister said she was stressed because she couldn’t check in on me the way she used to and felt disconnected.

On the other hand, I felt that my family should’ve made a better effort to communicate important events directly with me, especially knowing my usual mode of keeping in touch. I was frustrated that they didn’t consider that maybe I needed this break for my mental health.

Now, our family gatherings have become tense, and my relationships with them have strained. They still bring up my absence at my cousin’s wedding and other events I missed. They say I was selfish for not considering how my decision would affect them.

So, here I am, asking: Am I the asshole for assuming my family would be okay with me taking a 6-month break from social media without informing them?

70,ESH,"""AITA for expecting my family to respect my home boundaries after I've been consistently disrespected by them?""","I (29F) recently bought my first home, and it's been a huge milestone for me. After years of saving and working hard, I finally have a place to call my own. Naturally, I was excited to share this achievement with my family. My parents and siblings live nearby, and we've always had a close relationship, but there have been some growing tensions lately.

My family has always had a bit of a problem with boundaries. For instance, growing up, my parents would go through my things without asking, and my siblings would often borrow stuff and never return it. I hoped that moving into my own place would help establish some clear boundaries, but that hasn't been the case.

Since I moved in, my family has started dropping by unannounced. They'd bring over food, do surprise visits, and sometimes they even let themselves in when I'm not home. I appreciate their help and gestures, but it was becoming overwhelming. I sat them down and explained that while I love them and value their presence, I need them to respect my space and let me know before coming over.

They initially agreed, but the situation hasn't improved. Last weekend, I came home to find my mom cleaning my kitchen, my dad fixing a leak I didn't know existed, and my sister lounging in my living room. I was frustrated and asked them to leave, reminding them of our conversation about boundaries. They got offended, saying they were just trying to help and accused me of being ungrateful.

On the flip side, I've also been blunt and not very appreciative of their efforts, which has hurt their feelings. Instead of calmly reiterating my need for space, I snapped at them several times. We've had several arguments about this, and it's driving a wedge between us.

My friends have mixed opinions. Some think I'm right to expect my family to respect my space, while others believe I'm being ungrateful for their help. Now, things are tense, and I feel like I'm caught between maintaining my boundaries and not alienating my family.

So, AITA for expecting my family to respect my home boundaries after I've been consistently disrespected by them? Or am I handling this all wrong?"
71,ESH,"""AITA for not including my partner's family in our holiday traditions because we only spend holidays with my family?""","My partner and I have been together for five years and have a pretty established holiday tradition with my family. We spend Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter with my parents, siblings, and extended family. It's always been this way, and my family goes all out with decorations, big feasts, and lots of games and activities. My partner seemed to enjoy it, so I never thought much about changing our routine.

This year, things took a turn. My partner approached me in October and asked if we could start alternating holidays with his family or at least include them in some of our traditions. He mentioned that his family felt left out and missed spending holidays with him. I brushed it off, saying that my family had established traditions, and it wouldn't feel the same if we changed things. I assured him we could visit his family another time, but holidays were non-negotiable for me.

It caused a significant rift. My partner felt hurt and said he also had traditions he wanted to share with me, and it wasn't fair that we never considered his family in our plans. He argued that relationships are about compromise and that I was being selfish.

In the middle of all this, my parents got wind of the situation and supported me, claiming that our holidays are special and my partner should understand. My siblings think I should at least try to compromise, but they also enjoy our usual holiday setup and don't want it to change.

As a result, my partner and I had a big argument, and he decided to spend Thanksgiving with his family while I stayed with mine. It was the first time we spent a major holiday apart, and it felt strange. Now, Christmas is around the corner, and we still haven't resolved the issue. There's a lot of tension between us, and I'm beginning to worry that this could become a bigger problem if we don't find a solution.

I recognize that I might have been too rigid, but I also feel that our traditions are important and shouldn't be changed. However, I understand that my partner's family deserves consideration too.

So, AITA for not including my partner's family in our holiday traditions because we only spend holidays with my family?"
72,ESH,AITA for assuming my partner's family would be okay with a last-minute addition to the wedding guest list?,"My partner, Alex, and I are getting married in a few weeks. We're both very excited, and everything has been going relatively smoothly—until recently. For some background, Alex comes from a close-knit family that values tradition and proper etiquette. My family, on the other hand, is a bit more casual and spontaneous.

So, here's what happened: a week ago, I reconnected with a childhood friend, Sarah, who recently moved back to town. We hadn't seen each other in years, but we hit it off immediately and it felt like no time had passed. Naturally, I wanted to include her in one of the most important days of my life. Without thinking much about it, I reached out to our wedding planner and asked her to add Sarah to the guest list.

When I told Alex about it later that evening, he seemed taken aback but didn't say much besides a noncommittal ""okay."" I assumed everything was fine, but then I got a call from his mom the next day. She was upset and told me that adding a new guest so close to the wedding was disrespectful to the planning process and to the established guest list that everyone had already signed off on. She mentioned how Alex's side of the family had carefully curated the list to ensure an intimate and manageable event.

Feeling a bit blindsided, I argued that it's our wedding and that adding one more person wasn't that big of a deal. However, she insisted that it's about the principle and respect for the family's wishes and traditions. She also mentioned that other family members had wanted to invite last-minute guests but had refrained out of respect for our initial agreement.

When I brought this up with Alex again, he admitted that he was also uncomfortable with the last-minute change but didn't want to upset me. He suggested that I should have discussed it with him first before making any decisions. I felt terrible realizing I hadn't considered his feelings or the extra pressure this would put on his family.

Now, the situation is tense. My family thinks it's ridiculous to make such a big deal over one additional guest, especially since we're not even at the venue's capacity limit. They believe weddings are about celebrating with as many loved ones as possible. On the other hand, Alex's family sees this as a breach of trust and a logistical headache.

Ultimately, I realize that I probably should have handled this differently, and Alex acknowledges that he could have been more vocal about his concerns from the start. We both dropped the ball here.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for assuming my partner's family would be okay with a last-minute addition to the wedding guest list?"
73,ESH,"""AITA for having a meltdown over my mom's birthday gift and then refusing to help her pick out a gift for my dad?""","I’m 25, and my relationship with my mom has always been complicated. She has a habit of giving gifts that feel more like backhanded comments than thoughtful presents. For example, she once gave me a diet book for Christmas, and another time, she gifted me a cleaning supplies set because my apartment wasn't up to her standards.

My birthday was last week, and I was really hoping she might try to understand my interests better. I’m an artist and had hinted several times about needing new brushes or a specific book on modern art. Instead, she gave me a self-help book about ""overcoming laziness and unlocking potential."" I felt like it was another dig at how she perceives me.

I couldn’t hold it in and ended up having a meltdown right there in the living room. I told her how all her gifts make me feel like there’s always something wrong with me and that she never listens to what I actually want. My mom defended herself, saying she was only trying to help and that I was being ungrateful. My dad stood there looking uncomfortable and didn't say much.

After that incident, my mom approached me yesterday and asked for my help picking out a gift for my dad’s upcoming birthday. I flat out refused. I told her that if she couldn't make an effort to understand what I liked, I wasn’t going to invest time in helping her choose something for him. She looked hurt and said I was being childish and that she needed my support.

My brother thinks I overreacted and should have just let it go, while my best friend supports my decision, saying my mom needed a reality check. Consequently, the house has been tense. My dad has tried to smooth things over, but he’s stuck in the middle, and now I feel guilty for putting him in that position.

74,ESH,"""AITA for setting boundaries with my sibling after they had no issue disregarding mine?""","I (28F) have always had a rocky relationship with my younger sibling, Alex (24M). Growing up, Alex was the golden child and our parents often brushed aside my complaints about his behavior. As adults, we've tried to make amends, but our different personalities and past grievances often get in the way.

Last month, Alex and his partner Sarah (25F) stayed over at my place for the weekend. I had a few simple boundaries: no smoking inside, keep the noise down after 10 PM, and please don't use my office space as it has sensitive work materials. I explicitly told Alex these boundaries before they arrived, and he assured me they would respect them.

The first night, I came home late from work to find Sarah vaping in the living room and Alex playing loud music in my office. I reminded them of the boundaries, and Alex shrugged it off, saying they were just trying to relax. The next day, I found some of my work documents tampered with and my office a mess. When I confronted Alex, he brushed me off, saying I was being uptight.

This weekend, Alex invited me to their place for a small family gathering. Given the recent disregard for my boundaries, I decided to set some of my own: I'd leave by 9 PM since I had an early meeting, and I'd stay at a nearby hotel to avoid any potential conflicts. When I told Alex, he got extremely upset, saying I was being overly dramatic and making him look bad in front of our parents.

Our parents think I’m overreacting and that I should just let it go to keep the peace, but I feel like my boundaries were completely disregarded, and I don’t want to go through that again. On the other hand, I recognize that setting such stringent boundaries might come off as retaliatory and could be straining our already fragile relationship further.

Now there's tension, and it's affecting our whole family dynamic. Alex feels like I'm punishing him and Sarah for something minor, and our parents are urging me to apologize and just stay with them as planned.

Am I the asshole for setting these boundaries with my sibling after they had no issue disregarding mine?"
75,ESH,"""AITA for being annoyed that my sibling doesn't respect my boundaries, but also respecting theirs when they've been hurt in the past?""","I (28F) have a younger brother, Tom (24M), who has always been a bit of a free spirit. We grew up pretty close, but as we've gotten older, our differences have started to cause friction. Recently, things came to a head over a couple of incidents that have left me questioning whether I'm being unreasonable or not.

A little background: Tom has had some tough experiences with relationships in the past. He's been hurt a few times and tends to be very cautious about letting people into his life. I, on the other hand, have a more open and trusting nature, but I also value my personal space and boundaries. This difference in approach has started to create tension between us.

The first incident happened a few months ago when Tom came over to my house unexpectedly. I had a long day at work and was looking forward to some quiet time. When Tom showed up, I told him that I wasn't in the mood for company and asked if we could hang out another time. He got visibly upset and accused me of shutting him out. I tried to explain that I just needed some alone time, but he didn't seem to understand and left in a huff.

Fast forward to last week, Tom was going through a rough patch after a breakup and needed a place to crash for a few days. I told him he could stay with me, but I set some boundaries: no bringing strangers into the house, clean up after himself, and respect the quiet hours since I work from home and need to concentrate. He agreed, but it quickly became apparent that he wasn't following the rules. He brought a friend over without asking, left a mess in the kitchen, and played loud music late into the night.

When I confronted him about it, he apologized but also reminded me of the time I turned him away when he needed support. He argued that he's always respected my boundaries when it comes to letting people into his life, even if it's been difficult for him due to his past experiences. I felt torn because I wanted to support him, but I also needed my space to be respected.

My parents weighed in and said that I should be more understanding of Tom's situation, given his past, but they also acknowledged that he should respect my boundaries. Friends have been split, with some saying I should stand firm on my boundaries, while others think I'm being too rigid given Tom's recent struggles.

The outcome now is that Tom and I are barely speaking. He moved out after a few days, and there's still tension between us. I feel guilty for being annoyed at him for not respecting my boundaries, but I also feel like I'm only respecting his out of obligation due to his past experiences.

So, AITA for being annoyed that my sibling doesn't respect my boundaries, but also respecting theirs when they've been hurt in the past?"

Growing up, we had the usual sibling rivalry, but there was one incident 20 years ago that seems to have left a lingering scar. I won’t sugarcoat it – I messed up. I borrowed Sara’s car without permission, got into an accident, and lied about it for weeks before coming clean. It wasn’t my finest moment.

I’ve apologized countless times over the years, and I truly thought we had moved past it. Fast forward to today, we’re both married with kids, and we see each other regularly at family gatherings. However, whenever there's even a hint of conflict or disagreement, Sara finds a way to bring up “the car incident.” It’s as if it’s her trump card to win every argument or make me feel small.

Last weekend, we were at our parents' house for a barbecue. Conversation was flowing, and somehow it veered into how reliable (or not) I am. Sara took this opportunity to yet again bring up the car incident. I lost my patience and snapped back, telling her that it was 20 years ago, and she needed to let it go. Things escalated and ended with us shouting at each other in front of our bewildered families.

Our parents think we’re both being ridiculous and need to grow up. My husband thinks I should have kept my cool and not let her get under my skin, while Sara’s husband sided with her, saying that if it still bothers her, she has a right to express it.

Now, things are tense, and I’m left wondering if I was an asshole for getting defensive. I mean, it’s been two decades and I’ve tried to make amends multiple times, but she clearly still holds a grudge. On the other hand, I probably could’ve handled it better instead of blowing up in front of everyone.

So, AITA for getting defensive when my sibling brings up the one time I messed up 20 years ago?"
77,ESH,"""AITA for prioritizing my own emotional well-being over family drama?""","I come from a very tight-knit family that is known for its frequent gatherings and long-standing traditions. However, the past few years have been filled with tension and drama, mainly due to my older sister and her husband going through a very messy divorce. Every family event has turned into a nightmare with constant bickering, backstabbing, and endless gossip. It’s emotionally exhausting, and I’ve found myself dreading every single family function.

I have always tried to be the peacekeeper in the family, often putting my own happiness aside to mediate and keep things civil. However, it’s taken a toll on my mental health. Recently, I decided enough was enough. I told my parents and siblings that I would be scaling back my participation in family events. Instead of attending all our gatherings, I’d be focusing on my own emotional well-being and only showing up when I felt up to it.

Of course, this didn’t sit well with my family. My mother immediately accused me of being selfish and abandoning the family in their time of need. My sister, who is in the middle of the drama, said I was insensitive and that I didn’t care about what she was going through. Even my dad, who’s typically the most understanding, commented that it was unfair for me to just check out when things got tough.

I tried explaining that I wasn’t abandoning anyone but was simply trying to preserve my mental health. Unfortunately, that didn’t go over well. My brother, who has always been a bit of a hothead, told me to suck it up and that family sticks together no matter what. During this argument, words were said that can't be taken back, and now the atmosphere is even more strained. 

Since cutting down on my involvement, I’ve felt a sense of relief and have started to regain my emotional balance. But the angry texts and calls from family members haven’t stopped. My cousins have even begun taking sides, with some supporting my decision and others labeling me as the family traitor.

In the end, I just want to protect my mental health without having to bear the brunt of everyone’s issues. But the guilt and backlash make me question if I handled things the right way. 

So, am I the asshole for prioritizing my own emotional well-being over family drama?"
78,ESH,"""AITA for making my kids participate in my parents' ridiculous family traditions?""","My (35F) parents have always been big on family traditions. Growing up, my siblings and I were expected to participate in all sorts of quirky customs that my parents insisted were crucial for ""family bonding."" These traditions ranged from annual talent shows where each member had to perform something unique, to elaborate themed dinners where everyone had to dress up and act like characters from classic movies. While we often rolled our eyes, we mostly complied to keep the peace.

Now, my kids (10M and 8F) are at the age where they’re expected to join in. My parents are adamant that these traditions continue with the next generation, and I've been enforcing this on my kids. Recently, there was a big family reunion, and my parents insisted on having the traditional talent show again. My son had a soccer match the same day and wanted to skip the show to attend. I insisted he participate in the talent show instead, telling him that it was important for family unity and that sometimes sacrifices have to be made.

This led to a huge argument. My son was upset and my daughter, too, didn’t want to participate because she felt embarrassed sharing her singing in front of everyone. My husband sided with the kids, saying these traditions were outdated and that I was being unreasonable. He pointed out that forcing the kids to participate was only causing resentment and that they should have the choice to opt out.

The talent show happened, but it was a disaster. My son half-heartedly recited a poem and my daughter barely sang a few lines before bursting into tears. My parents were disappointed and blamed me for not preparing the kids properly. Afterwards, my husband and I had a heated discussion, and he said that I was ruining our kids' relationship with their grandparents by forcing these traditions on them.

Friends who know our family traditions are divided. Some say that it’s good to keep family traditions alive, while others agree with my husband and think I’m being too rigid. The kids have been distant since the incident, and the tension at home is palpable.

So, am I the asshole for making my kids participate in my parents' ridiculous family traditions?"
79,ESH,"""AITA for having a 2-hour argument with my sister over who ate the last of our childhood's favorite dessert?""","So my sister and I (both in our late 20s) have always been super close. Growing up, we shared everything, including this one dessert that our mom used to make – it's a nostalgic treat that we both loved. Mom passed away a few years ago, and we decided to start making the dessert ourselves on special occasions to keep the memory alive.

Last weekend, we made a batch for our joint birthday celebration. It turned out great, and we both were really happy about it. We decided to save some for the next day to enjoy with morning coffee. When we woke up, the dessert was gone. 

I immediately felt a surge of suspicion. I confronted my sister, convinced she had eaten it all late at night. She vehemently denied it and insisted that I was the one who got up in the middle of the night and finished it off. We both started throwing accusations at each other, bringing up old fights and past grievances. It turned into a marathon argument that lasted about two hours. Our partners stepped in at various points, trying to calm us down, but we were both too heated to listen.

My partner thinks this whole argument was ridiculous and unnecessary. He says I should have just let it go because it's just a dessert, and the memory it represents is more important than the actual treat. My sister's partner agrees and thinks my sister is just as much to blame for escalating things. I do see their point, but it felt like a betrayal. We both ruined what was supposed to be a special memory.

Now, things are awkward between us, and we barely speak. Our partners are frustrated, and the tension has spread to our entire family. Our dad even called to tell us to grow up and get over it. 

We're both incredibly stubborn and haven't apologized to each other yet. I feel like she should admit to eating it, and she obviously thinks I should. Am I the asshole for having a 2-hour argument with my sister over who ate the last of our childhood's favorite dessert?"
80,ESH,"""AITA for expecting my family to be flexible with plans when they're always canceling on me last minute?""","I've got a pretty complicated relationship with my family. Growing up, it was always chaotic and unpredictable, so I suppose I learned to adapt. Now that we're all adults, I find myself being the one who tries to keep everyone connected. But here's the thing: my family is notorious for canceling plans at the last minute. It feels like every time we plan something, there's some excuse, and it never goes as scheduled.

Last weekend, we had arranged a family dinner at my place. I spent the whole day preparing a nice meal, cleaning the house, and getting everything ready. An hour before everyone was supposed to arrive, I got a flurry of texts and calls canceling on me. My sister said her kid was feeling sick, my brother had a work emergency, and my parents decided they were too tired to drive over. I was frustrated, but I tried to understand.

Fast forward to last night. My brother called me out of the blue and asked if I could host a game night at my place because his girlfriend wanted to meet the family. It was very last minute, but I agreed because I figured it wouldn't hurt to try and accommodate them, even though it was inconvenient for me.

Well, guess what? Only my brother and his girlfriend showed up. My parents and sister canceled again, each with a different excuse. I was livid. I felt like I was being taken for granted, always bending over backward to adjust to their schedules, but they couldn't do the same for me.

This led to a huge argument over the phone where I told them how hurt I felt by their constant cancellations and last-minute changes. My mom said I was being unreasonable and that family should be more understanding and flexible. My sister chimed in, saying life happens and I need to be more accommodating. They both made me feel like I was the one being rigid and unfair.

Now, we're all not speaking, and there's a palpable tension. Some of my friends think I'm right for standing up for myself, but others say I should be more forgiving and understanding of my family's situation. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for expecting my family to be flexible with plans when they're always canceling on me last minute?"
81,ESH,"""AITA for having my kids help me pick out a more expensive gift for my mom's birthday than my sister-in-law gave their grandma?""","For some context, my mom’s (62F) birthday was coming up, and my kids (10M and 8F) and I (36F) decided to make it a special event this year. My mom has been incredibly supportive, especially through some rough patches recently, so we wanted to show our appreciation.

We brainstormed together and decided to get her a beautiful piece of jewelry that she had been eyeing for a while. It was more expensive than what we usually get, but I figured it was a one-time splurge for someone who deserved it. My kids were really excited and involved in the whole process, from picking out the piece to wrapping it up. They felt proud of their contribution and couldn’t wait to give it to their grandma.

We discussed our plans with my brother’s family when we all met for dinner a few days before mom's birthday. My sister-in-law (34F) mentioned that she had bought a nice handmade scarf for mom. It was thoughtful and lovely, but my brother and SIL have been more budget-conscious lately, and I could tell she was proud of her choice.

Fast forward to mom’s birthday, and we all gathered at her place for a small celebration. My SIL gave her the scarf first, and mom loved it. When it was our turn, my kids eagerly presented the jewelry. Mom was visibly touched and emotional, and everyone seemed happy for her.

After the celebration, my SIL pulled me aside and accused me of trying to one-up her, making her gift seem insignificant. She felt that involving my kids made it even worse because it highlighted the disparity in the gifts. I tried to explain that it wasn’t about outshining anyone but genuinely showing our appreciation for mom. However, she wasn’t convinced and said I’d created an uncomfortable situation.

Some family members have since weighed in with mixed reactions. A few think I went overboard and should have been more considerate of my brother’s family’s financial situation. Others believe it’s perfectly fine to involve my kids in giving a special gift, regardless of the comparison.

Mom is happy, but I’m left feeling uneasy about the whole situation. I didn't mean to cause any tension. Maybe I could have handled it differently, but was it really wrong to involve my kids in giving a more expensive gift? Am I the asshole for having my kids help me pick out a more expensive gift for my mom's birthday than my sister-in-law gave their grandma?"
82,ESH,"""AITA for expecting my partner to pay for our date nights, but I still pay for all household expenses?""","My partner and I have been together for about three years. We live together, and over time we've settled into certain financial routines. I earn considerably more than my partner, so I cover most of the household expenses – rent, utilities, groceries, etc. My partner contributes when they can, but the bulk of it falls on me. I’m okay with this because I want us to maintain a good quality of life and don’t want to pressure my partner financially.

Recently, I’ve been feeling that my partner should at least cover our date nights. We go out once a week, nothing extravagant – just dinner or a movie. It’s our way of maintaining a connection despite our busy lives. I brought this up to my partner, suggesting it would be fair for them to take over paying for these outings. It’s not a huge expense, but it would be a way for them to contribute more actively.

My partner agreed initially, but it didn’t last long. After a few weeks, they started to grumble about the costs, pointing out that they already contribute whenever they can. They feel it's unfair to expect them to pay for date nights when I’m the one earning significantly more. This led to several arguments, with both of us feeling misunderstood and unappreciated.

My friends and family are divided on the issue. Some say that since I earn more, it’s not a big deal for me to continue paying for date nights. Others believe my partner should step up, even if it means making some sacrifices elsewhere. My partner’s friends seem to think I’m being unreasonable, considering I already cover most of the living expenses.

The tension has definitely affected our relationship. Originally, I just wanted my partner to feel more involved in our financial decisions, but now it’s causing stress and resentment. We haven’t been on a date night in weeks because neither of us is willing to back down.

So, I’m left wondering if I’m in the wrong here. Should I not expect my partner to cover our date nights given our financial disparity? Or am I reasonable in wanting them to contribute in this small way? AITA?"
83,ESH,"""AITA for getting defensive when my mom accuses me of being the favorite child?""","I come from a family where the dynamics have always been a bit... complicated. There's me, my older brother Jake, and my mom. Growing up, my mom always had high expectations for both of us, but it always felt like she was a bit harder on Jake. He ended up struggling with school and has had a rocky career path, while I excelled academically and landed a stable job. This has led to some tension between us over the years.

The incident that sparked the latest conflict happened last weekend during a family dinner. My mom made an offhand comment about how I must be the favorite child because ""everything comes easy"" for me. She said it with a laugh, but it stung; it felt like she was minimizing my hard work and accomplishments. I tried to brush it off, but it clearly irked me.

I got defensive. I told her that it wasn't fair to label me as the favorite when I had worked incredibly hard to get to where I am. I pointed out that I never got any special treatment and that if anything, I felt like I had to work harder to prove myself. My mom snapped back, saying that my defensiveness just showed that I knew deep down that I was the favorite. Jake sat there uncomfortably, saying nothing.

Later, Jake told me that my reaction was over the top and that I should have just let it go. He felt like I was invalidating his struggles by making it all about me. My mom also called me later to say that my defensiveness only highlighted that I couldn't handle a bit of criticism, which just fueled the fire. According to her, I should have been more understanding of Jake's feelings and not made the conversation about myself.

Since then, the atmosphere whenever we’re together has been tense. Jake is avoiding me, and my mom is giving me the cold shoulder. I realize that maybe I could have handled things better, but I still feel like my mom's comment was unfair and uncalled for.

When he passed away, I inherited his collection. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but I always found the craftsmanship fascinating and it’s a way to remember him.

Recently, we had a big family gathering at my house for a holiday. My parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, and even some extended family I don’t see very often were all there. I decided to give them a tour of the house, including the special room where I keep my grandfather's collection.

Before the tour, I did mention that I was going to show something that might not be for everyone, but I guess I didn’t elaborate enough. As soon as I opened the door to the taxidermy room, I realized I had made a mistake. Some of my cousins and younger nieces and nephews were visibly upset. My aunt gasped and covered her child’s eyes, and one of my uncles made a sarcastic comment about having nightmares. 

My mom pulled me aside later and said that it was inappropriate to show the animals without giving a clearer warning, especially with so many kids around. She said that the room was “creepy” and that I should’ve given people a choice to see it or not. I argued that I did warn them, and it’s part of my home and my heritage. The conversation got heated, and some of the family left early.

Since then, I’ve gotten texts from various family members. Some agree with me and think it’s cool that I kept the collection, saying they wished they had been warned more clearly so they could have opted out. Others are mad, saying it was disturbing and inconsiderate, especially for the kids.

Now, I’m left wondering if I was in the wrong for sharing a part of my home that I’m proud of. Should I have handled it differently? It’s made things awkward within the family, and I don’t know how to make it right.

85,ESH,"""AITA for assuming my roommate was paying her share of the bills because she never complained about it?""","I moved in with my roommate Sarah about a year ago. We divided all our expenses evenly, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. Since I handle most of the bill payments, I would tell Sarah the amount owed each month, and she would Venmo me her share. Over time, it became routine and I stopped double-checking whether the transfers were going through, assuming that if there were any issues, she would speak up.

About six months ago, I noticed some financial discrepancies but brushed them off as my own miscalculations. A couple of days ago, I realized that Sarah hadn't been paying her share of the bills for the last three months. When I confronted her, she acted surprised and insisted she had sent the money. After checking her Venmo history together, it was clear she hadn't. 

Sarah apologized and said she assumed I was taking care of it because she hadn't heard from me about any issues. She admitted she should've double-checked but argued that I should've noticed sooner. I was furious and told her she needed to pay me back immediately. She agreed but seemed annoyed, saying I was partly to blame for not keeping better track.

Our mutual friends are divided on this. Some say Sarah should've been more responsible and kept tabs on her payments. Others say I should've communicated better and confirmed that the payments were received, especially since I took on the responsibility of handling the bills.

This whole situation has strained our relationship. Sarah did pay me back, but now there's this awkward tension. We used to hang out and do things together, but now we barely speak unless it's about the bills.

86,ESH,"""AITA for making my kid repeat a year because their siblings are doing it?""","I have three kids: twins who are 10, and my eldest who is 11. The twins had a rough year academically and after a lot of consultation with their teachers and a specialist, we decided the best course of action was for them to repeat the grade. They didn't quite grasp the necessary fundamentals, and we want them to be fully prepared for the future.

Now, here’s where things get tricky. My eldest, who is academically gifted, has always been in the same grade as the twins because we started them in school early. With the twins repeating the grade, my wife and I thought it might be beneficial for our eldest to repeat as well, so they can stay together. We felt it would foster a sense of camaraderie and support among them.

We presented this idea to our eldest, who was understandably upset. They argued that they shouldn't have to repeat a grade when they’ve done nothing wrong and have actually excelled. We tried to explain that it’s about creating a unified family experience and that they can help their siblings, but they weren't convinced. My eldest feels like they’re being punished for something that wasn’t their fault.

Friends and family are divided on the issue. Some agree with us, saying it might be beneficial for the twins and that it's just one year. Others, including my eldest’s teachers, believe it’s unfair to hold them back when they’re doing so well and could become bored and disengaged.

The long-term consequences are what weigh heavily on my mind. By repeating the year, my eldest could lose their enthusiasm for learning. On the other hand, if they move on without the twins, it could create a rift between the siblings, and the twins might feel even more inadequate compared to their older sibling.

So now, we’ve reached a stalemate. My eldest is still upset and refuses to acknowledge our decision as fair. The twins feel guilty for causing this mess, even though it’s no fault of their own. The home environment has become tense, and I worry about the lasting effects on all of our children’s relationships and academic futures.

In trying to create a cohesive family unit, I wonder if we’ve made things worse. Was it wrong to make this decision for my eldest based on the needs of their siblings? Did we overstep by prioritizing family unity over individual achievements?

Am I the asshole for making my kid repeat a year because their siblings are doing it?"

For some background, my grandma passed away about a year ago. She was an incredibly important figure in my life, almost like a second mother. I was always closer to her than any of my cousins, and we shared so many special moments together. She always told me stories about her engagement to my grandpa and how much she loved her ring. I've had a sentimental attachment to that ring for as long as I can remember.

Fast forward to now, my boyfriend recently proposed, and while he got me a beautiful ring, I couldn't help but think about my grandma's ring. I thought it would be incredibly meaningful to incorporate it into our wedding in some way, maybe even wear it as my own engagement ring. I talked to my mom about it, and she thought it was a lovely idea. She said I should ask my aunt, who is the executor of my grandma's estate.

Here's where things get messy. When I called my aunt and brought up the idea, she was immediately defensive. She told me that the ring was going to her daughter, my cousin, who is also engaged. My cousin and I have never been especially close, and from what I know, she didn't have the same relationship with our grandma that I did. They've never mentioned any sort of attachment to the ring before. 

I felt a little blindsided and got quite emotional. I tried to explain how much the ring meant to me and how special it would be for my wedding. My aunt was having none of it and said it was already decided. I got really upset and ended the call abruptly. 

Later, my mom tried to mediate, but my aunt stood firm. Now my family is divided. Some think I was being unreasonable and that I should respect my aunt's decision. Others think my aunt is being unfair and that the ring should go to me because of my close relationship with grandma.

The whole situation has caused a huge rift. My aunt and cousin are not talking to me, and my mom is stressed out trying to keep the peace. My fiancé is supportive but thinks I should've handled it better.

It's not uncommon for dinner conversations to turn into lectures about how I’m not living up to their expectations. 

My sister (28F) moved out a few years ago and has been supportive of me. She often told me that I should consider moving out for my own mental health and independence. After a particularly heated argument where my parents told me I was wasting my potential by working in a field I love but doesn’t pay much, I decided I had enough. I talked to my sister about it, and she encouraged me to find a place of my own.

So, I took her advice. I found an affordable apartment, signed the lease, and moved out within a month. When I told my parents, they were livid. They accused me of abandoning the family and not appreciating everything they’d done for me. They even said that I was being brainwashed by my sister, which seemed really unfair because she was just looking out for me.

My sister supported my decision, saying that sometimes tough love is necessary for parents to understand boundaries. Meanwhile, my parents have been cold and distant since I left, and they made it clear through family friends and other relatives that they think I’m ungrateful and disrespectful.

Some of my friends think I should have handled the situation differently, maybe had a more in-depth conversation with my parents before moving out. Others think my parents are being too harsh and controlling. 

The outcome has been strained family relationships. My parents barely talk to me now, and when they do, it’s very formal and distant. My sister is still supportive, but she feels somewhat guilty for pushing me to make this decision. Family gatherings are awkward, and there’s a lot of tension in the air.

89,ESH,"""AITA for letting my best friend pay off my student loans without telling my parents?""","So, here's the situation. I'm 26F and graduated from college a couple of years ago. Like many others, I came out with a mountain of student debt. My parents have always been very supportive, but they've also made it clear that they expect me to pay off my loans myself. They believe it's a crucial part of becoming financially independent and responsible. Enter my best friend, Jess. We've been inseparable since high school, and she recently came into a significant amount of money through an inheritance. Jess, being the incredibly generous person she is, offered to pay off my student loans entirely. At first, I was hesitant, but she insisted, saying that she wanted to help me out and that it would make her happy.

Without thinking too much about it, I accepted her offer. We went through the process, and just like that, my student loans were gone. It was an enormous relief. However, I decided not to tell my parents about it. I knew they wouldn't be happy with the idea of someone else, even Jess, paying off my debt. Fast forward a few months, and my parents found out. They were furious. They said that I should have told them and that it was irresponsible and dishonest to hide it from them. They also think I took advantage of Jess's kindness, which wasn't my intention at all. My parents believe that I should have discussed the offer with them first and perhaps let Jess use the money for something more meaningful or charitable.

On the other hand, Jess is upset because she feels like my parents don't appreciate her generosity, and she’s annoyed that they think she was being taken advantage of. I understand my parents' perspective, but I also feel like I wasn't wrong to accept help from a friend without consulting them. My friends are divided on this matter. Some believe my parents are overreacting and that I was right to accept Jess's help. Others agree with my parents and think I should have been upfront about it.

90,ESH,"""AITA for expecting my kids to take responsibility for their pets when they're clearly too young to handle it?""","I need some perspective on this because things have gotten pretty tense in our household. My kids, Tim (8) and Jenny (6), have been begging for pets for months. They promised they would take care of them, and eventually, I caved. We got a hamster for Tim and a fish for Jenny. At first, they were really excited and kept their word. But after a couple of weeks, the novelty wore off.

Now, the hamster’s cage is often dirty, and the fish tank hasn’t been cleaned in who knows how long. I’ve had to step in multiple times to make sure the pets are taken care of, which I think defeats the purpose of having the kids learn responsibility. I’ve tried reminding them and even set up a chore chart, but that didn’t really help. They either forget or get distracted, and I end up nagging them constantly.

My husband thinks it's too much to expect from kids their age. He says they’re just too young to handle the consistent responsibility that comes with pets. But I feel like if we don’t start teaching them now, when are they going to learn? We had pets growing up, and I remember taking care of them at a similar age. Then again, I don't recall being particularly good at it either, and it usually fell to my parents to pick up the slack.

Friends have weighed in with mixed opinions. Some agree with me, saying it’s good to instill responsibility early. Others side with my husband, suggesting that it's more work for us than it's worth and that it’s unfair to the kids. My sister bluntly said we shouldn't have gotten the pets if we weren't prepared for the extra work, while my mother insists pets are a good learning opportunity regardless of the hassle.

After much back-and-forth with my husband and seeing the state of the pets, I’m starting to question if it was fair to expect Tim and Jenny to manage this on their own. The hamster is looking a bit neglected, and I worry about the fish's health due to the tank's condition. I also can't ignore that I've been stressed out and probably not handling this in the best way, which certainly isn't helping the overall atmosphere at home.

So, am I the asshole for expecting my relatively young kids to take responsibility for their pets when they're clearly struggling with it? Or should I have seen this coming and set more realistic expectations from the start?"

We have these elaborate annual events – cookie baking days, decorating the house together, and a special family dinner on Christmas Eve where we all exchange small, personal gifts. This year, I (28F) started dating my partner (30M), and things have been going great. We've reached that stage where meeting each other's families and being part of family events feels natural.

Last month, I brought him to one of our family dinners, and everything went smoothly. He got along well with everyone, especially my younger cousin, who's pretty hard to please. So, with Christmas approaching, I thought it would be nice for him to join in our holiday traditions. I was super excited to include him in everything, from cookie baking day to Christmas Eve dinner.

I didn't ask my mom (52F) beforehand, thinking she'd be thrilled. To me, it felt obvious that she would be okay with it given how well he fit in at the last gathering. However, when my partner showed up for cookie baking day, my mom was visibly taken aback. She pulled me aside later and said that while she liked my partner, she felt it was too soon for him to be involved in our tightly-knit family traditions. She said these moments were sacred and she wished I had discussed it with her first.

I felt blindsided by her reaction and told her that I thought she was being unreasonable. I argued that if he was going to be a part of my life, it made sense to include him in these traditions sooner rather than later. She countered that this wasn't just about me and that she had hoped for more family-only time before bringing in someone new.

My brother (25M) thinks I'm in the right. He says our mom is being overly traditional and needs to be more flexible. Meanwhile, my aunt (my mom’s sister) is on my mom's side, saying that family traditions should be reserved for family members and that I should have been more considerate of my mom's feelings. 

My partner, though understanding, feels awkward about the whole situation now. He has started to question if he's overstepping boundaries, and it's created some tension between us. The holiday atmosphere, which used to be so warm and welcoming, now feels strained and uncomfortable.

Given this fallout, I can't help but wonder if I jumped the gun. Should I have discussed it with my mom first rather than assuming she'd be okay with it? Or is she being too rigid about who gets to participate in our traditions? Am I the asshole for assuming my mom would be okay with my partner being part of family traditions without discussing it first?"
92,ESH,"AITA for telling my neighbor to water their lawn, but only after I watered mine?","I live in a suburban area where the houses are close together, and the lawns are a big deal to everyone in the neighborhood. My neighbor, John, and I have had a friendly but competitive relationship when it comes to our lawns. We often joke about whose grass is greener, but it’s always been in good fun—at least, until recently.

We’ve been experiencing a bit of a drought this summer, so water usage has become a hot topic. The city has imposed some restrictions, and we’re technically only allowed to water our lawns on assigned days. John and I both know this, but we’ve been bending the rules here and there to keep our lawns looking nice.

Last week, it was my designated watering day, but I noticed John had started watering his lawn early, which meant less water pressure for me. My sprinklers were barely covering half my yard, and I got pretty frustrated. So, I went over to John’s house and asked him to stop watering until I was done with mine.

John didn’t take it well. He argued that we’re all suffering from the drought and that he had just as much right to water his lawn as I did. I told him that technically, I was in the right since it was my designated watering day. It got a bit heated, and eventually, he reluctantly agreed to stop his sprinklers while I finished up.

That evening, I was talking to my wife about the incident. She thinks I was being unreasonable and that I should have just shared the water pressure equally, given the circumstances. On the other hand, a few of my friends think I was just standing up for myself and that John should have respected the watering schedule.

Since then, things have been very awkward between John and me. He’s giving me the cold shoulder, and I feel like I may have damaged our neighborly relationship over something as trivial as lawn care. At the same time, I can’t shake off the feeling that he was being inconsiderate first by not sticking to the watering schedule.

So, AITA for telling my neighbor to water his lawn only after I finished watering mine?"
93,ESH,"""AITA for giving my mom a 20-minute warning before my 3-year-old's tantrum is about to escalate, and not expecting her to 'handle it'?""","AITA for giving my mom a 20-minute warning before my 3-year-old's tantrum is about to escalate, and not expecting her to 'handle it'?

So, my 3-year-old daughter, Lily, is a bit of a handful. She's this amazing bundle of energy and curiosity, but when she gets cranky, she can throw some epic tantrums. As her parent, I've learned to recognize the signs when she's about to go from mildly annoyed to full-blown meltdown. 

A couple of weeks ago, I had to visit my mom for an afternoon. I love my mom, and she adores Lily, but she tends to dismiss my advice when it comes to handling my daughter. She has this old-school mentality of ""kids should be seen and not heard,"" and thinks all Lily needs is a stern voice and some tough love. We've butted heads over this before, but I still wanted to give it another shot.

We were sitting in the living room, and I noticed Lily starting to get fidgety and whiny. I could tell she was about 20 minutes away from a major meltdown. I calmly told my mom, ""Hey, just a heads up, Lily is going to lose it in a bit. I'll handle it, so don't worry."" I thought giving her a heads-up would ease any tension.

But my mom took it the wrong way. She got really defensive and said, ""I raised you and your siblings, I know how to handle a tantrum."" I tried to explain that it's not about handling it, but more about preventing it from getting worse. She wasn’t having any of it and insisted on taking charge. Predictably, when Lily started her tantrum, my mom tried her ""stern"" approach, and it escalated quickly. Eventually, I had to step in, calm Lily down, and get her to take a nap.

After Lily was asleep, my mom and I had an argument. She felt disrespected that I didn’t trust her to handle the situation. I argued that it's not about trust, but about knowing my child and what works best for her. My dad chimed in, saying my mom was just trying to help and I should've been more appreciative. My husband later told me that while he understands my frustration, maybe I could've handled the situation with my mom more diplomatically.

The aftermath is that my mom and I are now in this awkward standoff. She thinks I undermined her authority, and I think she needs to respect my parenting choices. 

So, AITA for giving my mom a heads-up and stepping in when my daughter's tantrum escalated, or should I have just let my mom ""handle it""?"
94,ESH,"""AITA for assuming my sister's husband would be okay with our kids calling him by his first name?""","I (34F) have two kids, aged 5 and 7. My sister (32F), recently got married to her husband, Mark (35M). Mark has always seemed nice enough in the few times we’ve met, but we’ve never really had any deep conversations. Since they’ve been married, we’ve seen them more often, which has been mostly pleasant.

This past weekend, we had a family gathering at my parents’ house to celebrate my dad’s birthday. My kids are used to being around family and calling everyone by their first names, as it’s always been the norm in our family. So, naturally, they called Mark by his first name throughout the evening.

At one point, Mark pulled me aside and mentioned that he wasn’t comfortable with my kids calling him “Mark.” He said it felt too informal and he’d prefer “Uncle Mark” or even “Mr. Smith.” He emphasized that it was a matter of respect. I was taken aback and told him that in our family, first names are traditionally used, and it shouldn’t be a big deal. He insisted it was important, and we ended the conversation somewhat abruptly with no real resolution.

Later that evening, my sister approached me, obviously upset. She told me I was being disrespectful to her husband’s wishes and that it wasn’t a huge ask for the kids to call him “Uncle Mark” or even “Mr. Smith.” I tried to explain our family’s tradition, but she wouldn’t hear it. We ended up arguing, and the rest of the evening was pretty tense.

My parents and my husband think both sides have a point. My mom thinks we should respect Mark’s wishes since he’s part of the family now. My dad, on the other hand, thinks Mark is being overly sensitive and should just go along with our traditions. My husband feels caught in the middle and suggests we should have handled it better and found a compromise.

Since the incident, my sister and I haven’t spoken much, and I can tell Mark feels uncomfortable around me and my kids. I’m starting to wonder if I should have just agreed to his request to keep the peace, but I still feel like it’s strange to suddenly change how our kids address people in the family.

So, AITA for assuming Mark would be okay with our kids calling him by his first name?"
95,ESH,AITA for expecting my in-laws to respect my boundaries on social media after they constantly harass me?,"I (f28) have been dealing with some ongoing issues with my in-laws ever since my husband (m30) and I got married three years ago. My in-laws are very active on social media, and they expect everyone to be as engaged as they are. However, their constant tagging, commenting, and unsolicited advice have been overwhelming.

From the beginning, they would tag me in every family post, from Sunday dinners to random memes, and bombard me with messages if I didn’t respond promptly. Initially, I tried to be polite and engaging, but it started to feel intrusive, especially when they began to critique every aspect of our lives—giving us unsolicited parenting advice, commenting on our spending habits, and even making snide remarks about my job.

I recently decided to set some boundaries. I politely asked them to limit the tagging and constant messaging, explaining that while I appreciate their interest, it’s become a bit much, and I need some personal space.

Instead of understanding my perspective, they reacted poorly, claiming I was being unreasonable and trying to isolate my husband from his family. They called me ungrateful and accused me of ruining the family dynamic. Things got even worse when they started making passive-aggressive posts about how “some people” don’t value family.

In response, I blocked them, thinking it would be the best way to maintain my peace. This caused a huge blow-up. My husband is now stuck in the middle, trying to mediate, but he feels like I overreacted by blocking them altogether instead of finding a middle ground. He suggested I should have just muted or unfollowed them to avoid the confrontation.

My friends are split on this. Some think I had every right to block them given their behavior, while others think I should have handled it more diplomatically. My own parents even said that I might have gone too far and that blocking them was a bit harsh.

Now, my relationship with my in-laws is strained, and my husband feels caught in the crossfire. Meanwhile, I'm feeling both justified and guilty.

So, AITA for expecting my in-laws to respect my boundaries on social media and blocking them when they wouldn’t?"
96,ESH,AITA for having a big argument with my brother over who gets grandma's old house after she passed away?,"My grandmother passed away a few months ago, and she left behind a charming old house that holds a lot of sentimental value. She didn’t specify in her will who should get it, only that it should stay within the family. This has led to quite a tense situation between my brother (28M) and me (30F). We both want the house, but for different reasons.

I grew up spending most of my summers there, and I feel a deep connection to the place. I envision raising my future kids there, preserving our family's history. My brother, on the other hand, sees the house as a potential investment. He’s been talking about how the property values in the area have been rising and thinks selling it after some renovations would be a great financial move.

The argument reached a boiling point last week during a family dinner. My brother and I started discussing our plans for the house, and it quickly escalated into a shouting match. I accused him of being greedy and disrespecting Grandma’s memory, while he accused me of being overly sentimental and impractical. It got so loud that our parents had to step in to calm us down, but the damage was already done.

Our family members are divided on the issue. Some agree with me, thinking it’s important to keep the house within the family and honor Grandma’s memory. Others side with my brother, believing that the financial benefits could help our family in the long run. They’re all getting tired of our constant bickering and just want us to find a resolution.

The current outcome is a tense stalemate. Neither of us is willing to budge, and it’s affecting our relationship and the overall family dynamic. My brother and I used to be close, but now we’re barely speaking, and family gatherings have become awkward and uncomfortable.

I realize that I could have handled my emotions better and approached the conversation more calmly. My brother also could have been less dismissive of the sentimental value the house holds for me. Both of us are being stubborn and letting our emotions drive the conflict, which isn't helping anyone.

So, AITA for having a big argument with my brother over who gets Grandma’s old house after she passed away? Should we have found a way to discuss our differences more diplomatically, or am I justified in standing my ground for what I believe is right?"
97,ESH,"""AITA for buying a home with my partner without including their mom on the deed?""","My partner (f29) and I (m32) have been together for five years and recently decided to buy our first home together. We've been renting for years and saving up, and finally, the time came when we could afford a down payment. We found the perfect house, and everything seemed to be falling into place.

However, there's a catch. My partner's mom (f55) has always been very close to her. She lives nearby and has been very involved in our lives, sometimes a little too involved if you ask me. When we told her about the house, she was ecstatic, but then she dropped a bombshell: she expected to be included on the deed.

I was taken aback. I didn't see why her mom should be on the deed of a house my partner and I were buying together. We are the ones paying the mortgage and making the financial sacrifices. I calmly explained this to my partner, but she was torn. She didn't want to upset her mom, who claimed that being on the deed would give her some security and a place to stay in her old age. My partner’s mom has a history of health issues and has mentioned multiple times about being worried about the future.

After several heated discussions, I went ahead and bought the house with just my partner and me on the deed. I thought it was the responsible thing to do. My partner was upset but reluctantly agreed, saying she understood where I was coming from.

When her mom found out, she was furious. She accused me of trying to push her out and not considering her feelings. She said that after all she's done for us, this was a betrayal. She even convinced several family members to side with her, and now I’m getting cold shoulders from many of them. My own parents think that it's weird for her to be on the deed and support our decision, but they also think I could have handled the situation better.

My partner is caught in the middle and it's straining our relationship. Communication has been tense, and we’ve started arguing more frequently. We haven’t even moved into the new house yet, and it already feels tainted by this conflict.

So, AITA for buying a home with my partner without including her mom on the deed?

EDIT: Yes, I could have handled the conversation with more empathy, and I see that now. It wasn't my intention to alienate her mom, just to make a practical decision for our future."
98,ESH,"""AITA for setting boundaries with my in-laws after they consistently disrespected them?""","I've been married to my husband, Jake, for five years and we've had our fair share of ups and downs, especially when it comes to his family. My in-laws, particularly my mother-in-law, have a history of overstepping boundaries. From showing up unannounced at our house to making unsolicited comments about our life choices, it's been a constant struggle.

Last Christmas, we agreed on a specific time for them to visit, but they showed up three hours early while we were still getting everything ready. It was chaotic, and their presence added unnecessary stress. After that incident, I decided to put my foot down and set clear boundaries. I told them that while they are always welcome, they need to give us a heads-up and stick to the agreed-upon plans.

Of course, this didn't sit well with them. My mother-in-law accused me of trying to ""control"" the family and implied that I was being overly sensitive. She has continued to show up unannounced, and last week, she let herself into our house using the spare key we gave her for emergencies. I was livid and told her that if she couldn't respect our boundaries, we would have to reconsider her access to our home.

Jake was caught in the middle, trying to keep the peace but also understanding why I was upset. After discussing it, he agreed that we should change the locks and not give them a new key until they acknowledged and respected our boundaries.

This led to a huge fallout. My in-laws are furious and think I'm the one tearing the family apart. They've been calling Jake non-stop, and he's now second-guessing our decision. Some of my friends think I was too harsh, while others believe I did the right thing. My own parents are divided; my mom supports me, but my dad thinks I should've handled it more diplomatically.

Currently, my in-laws are giving us the silent treatment, and the tension is affecting my relationship with Jake. I feel like I'm stuck in a no-win situation.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for setting boundaries and changing the locks, even though my in-laws consistently disrespected them?"
99,ESH,"""AITA for getting upset when my family doesn't respect my decision to not participate in a family tradition?""","Growing up, my family has always had this tradition of gathering at our grandparents' house every Sunday for a big family dinner. Everyone is expected to attend unless they have a really good excuse. I've been part of this tradition my entire life, but recently, I've decided to take a step back. I'm in my late twenties now, and between work, friends, and trying to carve out some personal time for myself, these weekly dinners feel more like an obligation than a joyful reunion.

Two months ago, I told my family that I wouldn't be coming to the Sunday dinners every week anymore. I explained that I needed some time to focus on other aspects of my life and that I'd still try to make it when I could. My parents didn't take it well, saying that family should always come first and that I was being selfish. My siblings also chimed in, accusing me of not caring about the family and setting a bad example for our younger cousins.

The last straw was this past Sunday. My mom called me the night before and tried to guilt-trip me into coming by saying that my grandparents were really looking forward to seeing me. I stood my ground and said I wouldn't be there. The next day, my younger sister showed up at my apartment, unannounced, and dragged me to the dinner. She said I was making everyone worry and needed to be there. Not wanting to cause a scene, I went along but was visibly upset the whole time.

My other siblings and parents kept making passive-aggressive comments throughout the dinner about ""how nice it was for me to grace them with my presence."" I grew increasingly irritated and ended up leaving early, saying I had things to do. Now, my family is mad at me for leaving abruptly, and my sister feels hurt because she thinks she was just trying to help.

I understand why my family values this tradition so highly, and maybe I did overreact by walking out, but they also don't seem to respect my need for space. Some of my friends think I'm right to set boundaries, while others say I should just suck it up for the sake of family harmony.

Am I the asshole for getting upset when my family doesn't respect my decision to not participate in a family tradition?"
