0,yiplwk,AITA for asking my friend to move a picture of him and his wife because it made my wife uncomfortable?,asking my friend to move a picture of him and his wife because it made my wife uncomfortable,"

Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.


Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that! 

For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.


Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was ""bonkers"" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some ""explicit"" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such ""demand"" and be pushy still.


This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.


Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",me m and my wife dahlia f lost our apartment months ago and moved in with mom temporarily issues began to arise between dahlia and mom and i had to ask my friend anthony m to let us move in til i get enough money to rent out his wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there some issues started to arise fyi dahlia is very shy around anthony she grew up in conservative home and so its understandable but sometimes it can be a bit much i admit that for example she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open thankfully anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out last night dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall she told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable she asked if i could speak to anthony about it but he didnt take it well he gave me a look when i spoke to him and said this was bonkers because first of all his wife put it there and second of all the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasnt some explicit picture of them just a normal wedding kiss we started arguing and he said that it wasnt like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room i asked him to be a little more considerate because its not like i asked him to remove it completely just move it elsewhere that dahlia wont reach or keep it off the wall til we leave he said he was sorry but still refused i explained how dahlia was feeling but he said that again he was sorry but would not move the picture we argued some more and he said that its his house and that i was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such demand and be pushy still this morning dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved anthony is refusing which makes it worse now i feel like im getting stuck between a rock and a hard place yes she might just be over reacting but i feel like this isnt such a big ask for anthony to decline and turn down fwiw if it were me id go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable anthony has been a friend of mine for years i wouldnt have asked to move in with him if i didnt have such strong bond with him he himself constantly talks about all the things and situations i helped him out with and we are considered brothers,489,YTA

I'm (29) currently 7 months pregnant. It's been an okay pregnancy so far, but one thing I can't stand is traveling (makes me nauseous), let alone flying.

My husband's (31) step brother and his fiancee passed away, and the funeral is next week. It's in another city and we would have to fly out. As I mentioned, traveling makes me sick so I unfortunately won't be able to go. My husband wants to go by himself but I want him to stay with me, in case anything happens God forbid but also just for support. I suggested he video call with his siblings from the funeral, but he said he needs to be there and I'm being unsupportive of him.

3,yin7pf,"AITA for wanting to meet my ""daughter"" after giving up my parental rights?",wanting to meet my daughter after giving up my parental rights,"Long story short: in my (40f) twenties I had a one night stand with this guy ""Nathan"" (now 41m) and got pregnant. I first thought of having an abortion, but Nathan had come from a conservative religious background (not Christian) and wanted the baby so we made a deal: I would give birth to the child and sign away my parental rights (my name is not even in her birth certificate, it's a possibility in my country) and he would pay all the medical expenses plus some extra for my troubles. That's what we did and didn't keep contact after his daughter was born.

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine who has the same religion as Nathan sent me a post from her temple's youth group (they were asking for donations for the homeless) and one of the girls from the picture looked a lot like me. I searched for her profile and found out that she had Nathan's surname and had the right age to be the baby I gave away. She's 17 now and seems to be doing fine: she is involved in charity work, apparently loves music and has lots of pictures with friends and family (Nathan, his wife and half-siblings).

I never wanted nor want to be a mother but I became curious to know more about this human I put in the world, so I texted Nathan's old phone number, which he has not changed, and asked if he would allow me to meet his daughter, since I gave birth to her and everything, and made my intentions clear: I do not want to interfere with his family, just to know her. He then wrote a long text which comes down to the fact that I am an asshole for wanting to know his daughter now after I ""abandoned"" her and that this meeting would only mess up with her head. I told him I was telling him out of courtesy because soon the girl will be an adult and be able to choose herself if she wants to meet me. He then blocked me.

Am I being the asshole here? I don't think there is any harm in meeting my ""daughter""; she already has a great family and it would only be beneficial to her to know about her own history. But maybe I am not seeing the full picture.

Also sorry for any mistakes or weird phrases, English is not my first language.

UPDATE

Hi everyone. First of all, thank you for your judgement. Some of you were were pretty harsh and a bit misogynistic to be honest, but I needed to hear what the well-intentioned comments had to say. Some answers to common assumptions:

 1. I wasn’t coherced into giving birth.  Nathan and I reached an agreement in a situation that involved us both. I’ll admit that I was young, didn’t know what pregnancy was really like and needed the money (which I’m not proud of but hey y’all are gonna judge me anyway).

2. I didn’t want to reach out to Nathan’s daughter just because she looks like me. I only mentioned it because this is what made me realize that the girl on the picture was the child I gave birth to, but it blew out of proportion. 

3. I don’t know why some people assumed Nathan is Christian and why they were judging him for being religious. He is Jewish and I am agnostic myself but don’t think it’s a problem for him to have a strong bond with his religion. The one night stand happened when we were very young and I don’t know what his views are about that, but it doesn’t matter. His daughter apparently is very attached to their community and it’s important to her. Also I might have used the world temple wrong but I’m not Jewish myself. 

4. When I said I don’t want to be a mother I didn’t mean I didn’t want a relationship with Nathan's daughter. I am not her mother since I didn’t raise and don’t want to take this place from the person who truly did: his wife. I also chose not to have children of my own.

So after reading your comments, I came to a better understanding of what my role is in this situation and decided to reach out to his wife through social media to try to make amends. She was very understanding and explained to me that Nathan had a couple of tough years being a single dad before meeting her and me coming back like that made it seem (like some of you pointed out) that I wanted to skip the hard parts and become a parent out of nowhere, which was never my intention. They told their daughter that her birth mother had to go back to her home country and couldn't  take care of her, which was kind. The wife is going to talk to Nathan to leave the door open if their daughter wants to meet me when she’s older and I gave her all my contact information for when and if the time comes. I'll admit I was being a bit selfish here, so that is the best ending I could hope for.

4,yipi15,AITA for making my roommate replace my garlic that she used?,making my roommate replace my garlic that she used,"Last week, I came home and my roommate told me that without asking me, she had used the garlic I had in the fridge. I was bothered that she didn’t bother to ask me when it would take a two minute text exchange. She just expected I’d be okay with her using something I bought because we lived together, and didn’t think of how it could inconvenience me if I needed to use garlic that night. To be fair to her, she said she’d replace it, but didn’t give any timeline on when that would be. 

And some important context: my current roommate knows I had a history of shitty roommates that take advantage of my kindness. I chose her specifically because I didn’t expect she’d be the type to do that. Hence why this stung. 

Anyways, told her I was upset that she used it, and that she needed to replace it tonight. She fought back, but went out and bought some. 

She came back with the garlic cloves separated and peeled instead of a fresh bulb. In my opinion, there is a difference in how the two taste, and I told her I wanted the actual bulb instead of what she got me. She started complaining but went and bought the bulb, which should have ended things. 

I had forgiven her and moved on, but apparently she’s been telling our friends a filtered version of the story to make me look bad and apparently mocking me for it, which obviously hurts. I don’t think I’m the villain here, but everyone else does and I feel alone. AITA?

11,yiadxe,AITA for bringing my wheelchair bound boyfriend to my brother's no +1 wedding?,bringing my wheelchair bound boyfriend to my brothers no wedding,"
My f31 brother m33 got married days ago. He and his now wife sent me an invitation and mentioned a ""no +1"" rule. Meaning that I wasn't allowed to bring my wheelchair bound boyfriend of 4 years with me. I tried to dicuss an exception for this rule because for one, my boyfriend is family and no one would deny that fact. And two, I could not find proper arrangements to have someone watch him (I'm his primary caregiver) while I was gone.


I brought him with me to the wedding. My brother and his bride were livid and picked up an argument with me about it. My brother said some hurtful stuff but I was glad he didn't say it infront of my boyfriend. I told him it's not like my boyfriend was making a fuss or being distracting (he just remained quiet and respectful of everyone around him) my brother argued that non of that matter and that the trust and respect he had for me was gone the minute I decided to stomp on his wedding boundaries and override the rules. My parents understood my side but also said that it was my brother's wedding and I should've respected the rule he had for non-official couples.


We've not been talking since the wedding. I tried calling him but keep getting hung up on. His wife texted me yesterdag to stop calling.

12,yijwht,AITA for calling my daughter's ballet lessons a waste of money in an argument?,calling my daughters ballet lessons a waste of money in an argument,"I (m31) live with my wife (f30). We have two kids, (f6) and (f2).

We've recently had a bit of financial difficulty as our rent got increased and my job has been cutting my hours. We aren't struggling to survive but we need to count our coins before buying any luxuries.

I managed to get a second job to make up for the cut hours but we still need to be very mindful about where our money goes and I've had a few discussions with my wife about it.

My wife is a SAHM. Our eldest goes to school from 8am to 4pm. My job covers childcare for our youngest and she goes to daycare from 8am to 2pm, 3 days a week. I take the kids to school and daycare and my wife picks them up.

I noticed some transactions from our shared bank account that were unusual and I asked my wife about it. She explained that she's been taking our youngest to ballet lessons in the afternoons after daycare once a week, and each lesson is £30.

I got annoyed because my wife didn't discuss this with me and £30 a week is quite a bit of money. I asked her to stop taking her to the lessons because we can't afford them but suggested she look for cheaper activities, preferably something both of our children could enjoy. My wife protested and said that our youngest really enjoys the ballet, she called me an asshole and said that I'm depriving my daughter of something that could help her future, and that we can find a way to afford them.

I called the lessons a waste of money and told my wife that we are partners and she shouldn't spend large amounts without discussing it, especially when we don't have a lot as it is.

My wife started crying and said that something that makes our child happy isn't a waste of money. She went into our room and slammed the door and that was the end of that conversation.

Since then, my wife hasn't really been speaking to me and I wonder if I was the AH here.

20,yi4db7,"AITA for leaving my girlfriend ""stranded"" when she chose to ignore me?",leaving my girlfriend stranded when she chose to ignore me,"I 27 went to a pumpkin patch with my girlfriend 22 and a bunch of her friends.  I was told it was a couples thing but I was the only guy there.  That's fine. I am okay with her friends. I am past the whole cutesy date thing but I like making her happy.  

But then they all started ignoring me. Every time I tried to join a conversation or spend time with my girlfriend I got frozen out.  Like I was intruding.  I asked her if she wanted to go do the corn maze with me and it was like I was some creepy guy at a bar. They all had to come along. Like I was trying to seperate her. I totally was but I don't think that's a bad thing.  

Anyways they all decided to split up in the maze and my girlfriend went with them.  

Fuck this noise.  I could go catch the Seahawks game if I boogied.  So I texted her that she had five minutes to respond to me or I was going back to town to watch the game and she could get a ride back with her friends.  

I was literally watching the second quarter before she responded.  It took her that long to notice that I was gone.  She said her friend would have to drive really far out of her way to drop her off and that I should come get her.  

I was definitely over the limit and I told her to get an Uber and I would pay for it. She said never mind and spent the night at her place instead.  

I just woke up to about fifty texts from her and her friends calling me an asshole for leaving without telling anyone.  

I did tell her. She just chose to ignore me.  

I'm kind of pissed that I wasted all that gas and time and we never even got to actually spend time together.  I'm upset with her and her bullshit friends.  

AITA?

Edit to provide answers to common questions. 

We have been dating for about six months.  

Our age difference is roughly 3 years and 10 months.  I didn't realize that made me a dirty old man.  

I enjoy taking her out and having fun. She is just starting her career and I am established in mine.  So I like taking her out for fun stuff she enjoys. 

When I said I am past the cutesy date thing I meant that I would not be the one to suggest a date at a pumpkin patch.  But she was a theater kid and I took her to see Hamilton. She loved it.  I go out of my way to take her to things she will enjoy.  And when we hang out with my friends they all include he because she is awesome.  My friends' wives and girlfriends all in life her in stuff too.  

This is the first time she has behaved like this.  

The pumpkin patch had five bars of signal and all of them were posting constantly the entire time they were there.

Edit number two because I can't do math.

 The difference in our ages is exactly four years and 37 days.  Sorry.

Edit three


For those of you with a problem with our age difference think of it as her robbing the grave not me robbing the cradle.

Final edit I think.  

We spoke.  It turns out that the friends were pissed that I showed up. Not because I was there but because the other boyfriends all blew them off to watch the game. So they basically convinced her that it should be a girls day.  Which was fine. If she had told me I would have gone to a pub nearby to get some food, have a beer and wait for her to get back to me.  I was wrong about her sorority sister from Los Angeles being the tipping point. She was the one saying that they were being dicks excluding me.

24,yiopjh,AITA for beating my coworker's kid at super smash bros.,beating my coworkers kid at super smash bros,"So this happened at a small Halloween get together I went to with a few work friends. A lot of them are older than me (28) and are at the point that they have kids like the person whose house we were. They are somewhere in their 50's I don't know the exact age but they have a few kids the youngest of which was like 8 or 9 and was at the party. 

The kid is just bored and trying to do something, his dad mentions that I might play some of the same games he does and yeah sure enough we both play smash brothers. Kids asks if I want to play a game and I'm bored so I agree.

This is where I totally wipe the floor with the kid. Like no contest at all. He trys several different game modes and rules to try and get a win in and he takes the l every time. After a few losses he's getting visibly frustrated, his teenaged sibling tries to keep him calm to no avail. I just keep letting the kid play me as long as he wanted to, i wasnt particularly egging him on or anything either i would usually just ask if he wanted to go again.

Eventually the kid has a mini tantrum and his dad has to stop what he's doing to scold him and send him to bed. It was a little awkward for everyone.

No one ever directly put blame on me for it but I could kinda tell from the vibe in the room that they low key blamed me for the outburst as well. And there were lots of small Comments saying things like I was a little harsh or asking why I couldn't just let him win one, or why I didn't stop playing with him after he started getting mad. I just told them I was having fun and left it at that.

I'll admit to not being the best read on social situations but I feel like none of the blame should be put on me at all. I don't feel particularly obligated to go easy on him just because he's a kid.

28,yi6xqq,AITA for wanting to charge my niece rent while living in our apartment?,wanting to charge my niece rent while living in our apartment,"Me (47) and my husband 'Tom' (50) have a daughter 'Alice' (20). Alice is a full time college student, but works at a fast food place on the weekends. She received a scholarship to her college that cover most costs, and we pay the rest. Me and Tom own our apartment, we also own a second apartment that we let Alice live in, so she doesn't have to worry about rent and can focus on her studies.

Tom's sister has a daughter 'Rose' (21). Her parents live in a different state but she moved here for college, not the same as Alice, a significantly more expensive one. Rose recently ran into some troubles and struggling to pay for her housing. Rose, as well as my SIL, asked if she could room with Alice for a little while while she saves up. We've talked to Alice and she's fine having Rose stay with her.

Tom is insisting we let Rose stay for free, but I think she should pay rent. Rose said she'd cover utilities and food, and he's insisting that's more than enough and we should help her out. I replied that we are helping her out by giving her a place to stay, and the rent would be less than market rent.

49,yiyg24,AITA for kicking my friend out of my bridal party when she's been excluding me?,kicking my friend out of my bridal party when shes been excluding me,"Throw away account - 

So one of my friends of 15+ years, we'll call her Chelsea, got engaged to her bf of 7 years this year in February and 5 months later in June, I also got engaged to my bf of 4 years. 

Because I'm currently in school for my teaching credentials, I need to get married end of June 2024 because that was my only break from school. I asked Chelsea when she was looking to have her wedding and she told me she already picked a date and it was in July 2024 - only 1 week after my wedding. When I told her the date I wanted, she called her venue and moved it another week out, but that still only leaves our weddings 2 weeks apart. I told her I wouldn't be able to make it since I'll probably still be on my honeymoon and she said she was okay with it, but I was annoyed that she's so nonchalant with me not being able to attend. 

The plan was to have each other as bridesmaids so I asked her to be mine, but she didn't ask me because I won't be at the wedding, which I get, but now it feels like I'm no longer part of the friend group.

A few months ago, she texts me and my friends that she's having a dinner to celebrate her engagement and I told her I couldn't make it because I had a trip planned. On the day of my trip, my flight got delayed to the next day so I could've attended, but I didn't know when or where the dinner was because she never even bothered to send me an official invite. 

Throughout the last few months, she's been texting our group chats trying to plan her bridal shower and bachelorette, but I didn't respond because I was still hurt about not being invited to the dinner and I just got busy with work. On facebook, I see that she posts a confirmation email of her booking her Miami bach trip with our friends, but didn't bother texting me separately to see if I could come. 

It feels like she's been excluding me so I called her and told her that I no longer wanted her to be my bridesmaid because I was still mad our dates were so close together. She knows I'm still trying to get my teaching credentials and have no other times to get married so I don't know why she's in such a rush to get married. Ever since then, she's been hanging out with our friends without me and making it very apparent that I'm excluded.

We suspected pregnancy but the last 3 tests have said negative and she has been 1 month late for her period. I'm worried if it's not pregnancy, if some other medical issue could be a cause. I had suggested to her to book a doctors appointment as it might shed some light on what is going on. She resisted all my requests, and so where I recognize I'm an asshole, asked her best friends to help me convince her. This was essentially four people nagging my wife and upset her greatly. I own up to that, and made steps to ask them to stop. Right now, I'm asking myself if it would be the right thing to make a Doctors Appointment without her consent or knowing. I want her to be healthy and safe and I want treatment best for her than stressing about what is going on with her body.  


For information, My wife believes herself overweight or obese. Not that I particularly find that a problem or even a barrier for emotional intimacy. (Or Sexual) I Love her greatly and I want to know if this is a hill worth fighting over. She also fears hearing the Doctors saying her late period is due to obesity. Which I understand and empathize her feelings and struggles with weight to have to hear that from what is essentially a stranger.

TLDR: boyfriend got me the same gift as mom and sis, I find this weird and think he should have got me something unique? Thoughts? Am I in the wrong for being put off? 

For Christmas my (23 f) boyfriend (24 m) of 6 years got me a diffuser, then his mom and sister tell me that he also got them the same diffuser! Essentially he just went and got us all the same gift. I had told him I thought diffusers were interesting so it would have been a great gift. I'm just bothered that he also got his mom and sister the same thing. The physical gift it self doesn't bother me (I wasn’t expecting a Louis Vuitton bag), it's the principal. I would have liked something more unique, it feels weird and kinda thoughtless that he got us all the same thing. I don’t like being grouped into the same category as his mom.. I can't image buying him, my dad, and brother the same thing. 

Would you be upset? Am I justified for being slightly put off by this ? How would you react?

I didn’t say anything to him and I do like the diffuser. Maybe I’m in the wrong for being put off?

I'm not going to be all macho and pretend nothing scares me. Heights give me the heebie geebies.  So we went to a haunted house event. Not that crazy one where they actually torture you and you have to sign a forty page waiver, but it was still pretty extreme.  I think we have all seen the pictures of groups of people recoiling in fear. 

I however do not startle easy.  And I have a difficult time suspending disbelief.  So the guy chasing us through the haunted house with a chainsaw wasn't scary.  To me.  My girlfriend was scared from the disorientation and the noise and the best really amazing costume.  But I played along. I let the actors chase us, I hid with her in a closet where the back falls away and there is a Japanese ghost girl in it. It was fun and my girlfriend was happy. When we got to the last room. The one where they take the picture of your group being scared, I didn't react to the thing that scares everyone else.  I won't spoil it but I can understand why it would scare people.  

So we got out and we went to see the pictures and there we are a group of six people with five cowering in fear and me looking slightly interested at the way they pulled off the effect.  

I told my girlfriend I was so scared I froze.  

So anyway we go have a few drinks and some food at a pub down the way.  And on the way back to the car I saw one of the guys from the haunted house vaping in the alley.  So I walked up quietly behind him and whispered ""come here honey"" in a deep gravelly voice.  I am 6'2"" and about 275. And I look a little bit like someone you would not want to share a prison cell with.  

I was just joking but he jumped and knocked over some bottles that were on a ledge by him.  I apologized for my silly prank. But he looked pissed and the other actors got that I was joking and laughed.  I didn't touch him or anything. That would have been rude.  

My girlfriend said I was an asshole for scaring him on his break.  I feel kind of bad about it but you would think a guy who does that for work would have a better sense of humor about being scared.

Edit already damn it.

Hello. This is a throwaway account. Im 38yo (M), my Fiancée Mary is 24 (F). We are going to get married in 2 months, and we have been dating for almost 2 years. The wedding planning has been expensive, and stressful. This is my second marriage, and in my first wedding, my (at the time) future in laws and my parents paid an equal financial percentage of the wedding. The arrangement was that me, my (at the time) partner, her parents and my parents would pay a quarter of the total cost.

So, this time, I was expecting a similar arrangement for this wedding. My current fiancée Mary agreed at first, but after speaking to her parents, they said that would not pay. My parents already paid their part, I gave my part, and my fiancée also paid her part, but her parents keep saying that they can't afford it (Tho, I know very well that they can afford it, they have some business and travel often).

Mary keeps saying that we should let it go, that we can cut costs or that she and her brothers will try to pay for her parents, but I've told her, multiple times already, that it is not fair to let them go free of charge, while my parents paid their part, and she agreed to this, and they should follow through. My parents also say that it is not fair to let only one set of parents to pay the percentage.

As Mary and her parents still insists in not paying, I decided to uninvite them. Mary was not happy about it, since she wants her dad to walk her to the altar, but I still try to make her see the situation from my point of view, but she is stubborn to just let them into the wedding for free, that it would be taken by my family as a sign of disrespect from her family.

He wants to leave the bigger house to my sister because he wants that property to eventually go to his grandkids.

He seems to be reluctant to do this because I think he’s afraid that there might not be enough stock/cash to do that. However, he has done a lot more for her already, for example funding the grandkids college educations, buying them both cars etc. He has been very generous to me and my spouse too, but less so simply because we don’t have kids to spoil. 

Also worth noting, in my will, half of all my assets will go to my sisters kids, and the other half will go to my spouse’s sister’s kids. If my spouse and I die tomorrow, each of our nieces/nephews would get several hundred thousand dollars each just from us. 

I am ok with my sister getting a little more than me, but also see it as a judgment on me and my life, and I don’t think she should get everything just handed to her at my expense. She has thrown salt in the wound by referring to the bigger house as “hers” for years, joking that she is my parent’s favorite, and bad mouthing me to our family, damaging my relationship with them, especially my niece/nephew. 

I know this sounds petty and selfish, and it is. But it’s also the kind of resentment that splits families apart.

133,yioyqw,AITA for making my (22F) boyfriend's (27M) mother biscuits?,making my f boyfriends m mother biscuits,"Long story short, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and, days ago, I finally got to meet his parents (actually, his dad and stepmom, but he considers her as his mom and calls her so), and, as a nice personal gesture, as I love to cook, I decided to bake a batch of biscuits. I met up with his parents, they loved me and I loved them, I gave them the biscuits and they loved the attention, but here's the thing : my boyfriend's parents have been separated for decades now, because of a very sad story that tore their family apart (my bf's bio mom cheated on his dad) and even though he denies it, and doesn't show it, he still resents her for it. Word travels lightning fast in our small town, and she found out that I met up with my bf's dad and stepmom, and she was apparently quite saddened by the news, but understands. I told my boyfriend that it was only fair that we'd meet up with her as well and he said okay. I told him I'd make biscuits for her too, and he already seemed not to like the idea...The day before meeting up, my boyfriend enters the kitchen and sees me baking the same biscuits I gave his dad and stepmom earlier, but for his mom, this time. He asks what I'm doing, I tell him, and he goes ""You're really doing that? Why are you going through that pain, it's not worth it"", I tell him he's being weird and there's no reason I wouldn't treat his mom the way I did his dad and stepmom and he just leaves the room. While we get ready to leave, he tells me to leave the biscuits at home, that she won't like them anyway, that there's no reason, so I confront him and ask him why a simple nice gesture for her is too much to him. He pretends not to understand, I cave, because I don't want it to become a full blown argument. We have a lovely time with his mom, then we go home...My bf's not a fan of sugar and I made a full batch, so about 30 biscuits...Yesterday, his mom passed by to say hi because she was running errands on our side of the town while he was at work. It was thirty seconds, I gave her the biscuits because I didn't want them to go to waste. My bf found out because she complimented them to him on the phone, and now he's mad. This is ridiculous to me, childish even, and it makes no sense. I think he still hasn't forgiven her for the trauma of his parents' divorce (it was very tough on him, the other he was telling me about how it ""ruined his life"" because the guy his mom left his dad for was a PoS and basically made his life a living hell for a decade and he still remembers the day his parents sat him down to tell him it was over), but he also talks with her on the phone at least once a week and is very sweet to her, never a bad word...He's cold with me now and refuses to admit there is something wrong...Am I the asshole for just wanting to treat his parents equally?",long story short my boyfriend and i have been dating for a few months now and days ago i finally got to meet his parents actually his dad and stepmom but he considers her as his mom and calls her so and as a nice personal gesture as i love to cook i decided to bake a batch of biscuits i met up with his parents they loved me and i loved them i gave them the biscuits and they loved the attention but heres the thing my boyfriends parents have been separated for decades now because of a very sad story that tore their family apart my bfs bio mom cheated on his dad and even though he denies it and doesnt show it he still resents her for it word travels lightning fast in our small town and she found out that i met up with my bfs dad and stepmom and she was apparently quite saddened by the news but understands i told my boyfriend that it was only fair that wed meet up with her as well and he said okay i told him id make biscuits for her too and he already seemed not to like the ideathe day before meeting up my boyfriend enters the kitchen and sees me baking the same biscuits i gave his dad and stepmom earlier but for his mom this time he asks what im doing i tell him and he goes youre really doing that why are you going through that pain its not worth it i tell him hes being weird and theres no reason i wouldnt treat his mom the way i did his dad and stepmom and he just leaves the room while we get ready to leave he tells me to leave the biscuits at home that she wont like them anyway that theres no reason so i confront him and ask him why a simple nice gesture for her is too much to him he pretends not to understand i cave because i dont want it to become a full blown argument we have a lovely time with his mom then we go homemy bfs not a fan of sugar and i made a full batch so about biscuitsyesterday his mom passed by to say hi because she was running errands on our side of the town while he was at work it was thirty seconds i gave her the biscuits because i didnt want them to go to waste my bf found out because she complimented them to him on the phone and now hes mad this is ridiculous to me childish even and it makes no sense i think he still hasnt forgiven her for the trauma of his parents divorce it was very tough on him the other he was telling me about how it ruined his life because the guy his mom left his dad for was a pos and basically made his life a living hell for a decade and he still remembers the day his parents sat him down to tell him it was over but he also talks with her on the phone at least once a week and is very sweet to her never a bad wordhes cold with me now and refuses to admit there is something wrongam i the asshole for just wanting to treat his parents equally,565,YTA
139,yiwxpv,AITA for refusing to sit with my partner?,refusing to sit with my partner,"throwaway, etc.

I live with two roommates and my partner, Fred. We have been having a fair amount of on and off tension with one of the roommates, Amy. Amy, who I do care about a lot, has a long trauma history and can be very combative and argumentative when she's feeling defensive. Honestly a generally argumentative person. Fred and Amy have been in the majority of the conflict-- while they share a lot of common interests and views, they bring out the worst in each other and there's been a lot of discontent that they've worked to resolve and set aside.

On to tonight: Amy, Fred and I were headed out to an event and were planning to meet our other roommate there. On the way, Fred and Amy get into an argument about how rent is paid (we all venmo Fred and then he pays our landlord. He is asking for the venmo to be sent a few days prior to the 1st of the month so he can send rent on time. Amy is resistant to this and doesn't want to elaborate further.)

I could give you a play by play of the exact argument, but I think it's safe to say neither handled it well and it escalated quickly to yelling and vitriol. I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story. I asked them both to be quiet and essentially said: I can see there's a miscommunication, it's not appropriate or productive to keep yelling mean things so knock it off. They were both eventually able to stop and don't speak for the rest of the ride.

He drops us off and parks the car. They don't speak in line but both speak with me normally. When we're settled, he says he doesn't want to sit by Amy and goes off to sit by himself, indicating I should go with him.

Here's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: I had set up the blanket and we were expecting our friends. I felt like it was an escalation to take a stand and go sit alone with Fred rather than for Amy and Fred to continue to keep distance and resolve at a later time. While it was super clear that Amy started the original rent issue by refusing to communicate, neither handled it well and I was upset with both of them.

I went off to call a friend and vent. Fred came up to me and insisted I go sit with him or he was going to leave and take the car with him, leaving Amy and I to find our own way home. He said he wouldn't tolerate being treated like this (a common feeling he has about Amy) and needed me to take a stand with him. I felt like he was putting me between a rock and a hard place. I told him explicitly, repeatedly, that I agreed with him, side with him, know it's wrong, and just don't agree with his actions handling it after the fact. I think he felt betrayed and like I wasn't taking his side.

I was able to convince him to leave me the car because I felt that was kind of rude, and he went home on his own. Now he isn't speaking to me and is extremely upset-- more than usual, and I'm wondering if I read the whole situation wrong.

152,yiy8aa,AITA for being upset that someone is naming their kid after my recently deceased father?,being upset that someone is naming their kid after my recently deceased father,"AITA?  
My dad died this past May after an extremely long battle with lung disease, a lung transplant, and the complications of the transplant (he died almost 2 years after receiving the transplant). There was a lot of suffering, both mentally and physically, experienced by my dad of course but also my mom/sisters/myself. I won’t go into detail, but the last two years have been extremely challenging for us all.

My dad had a sister, and they are estranged. I could not recognize her passing in the street, and they have probably spoken less than 5-10 times in the 30 years I’ve been alive. His sister has two kids, a son and daughter, both older than I am. The only time the son has ’shown’ up in our lives is when he called our house to ask my dad for money. Writing this post, I can’t even remember what his name is. The daughter friended me on Facebook years ago and did occasionally ask me how my dad was when he was at his sickest (mostly to share with her mom). My dad’s sister, her daughter, and her daughter’s kids showed up to my older sister’s wedding in 2013 - they sat in the car during the outdoor ceremony (the weather was beautiful) and left immediately after. That was the first/last time we saw them, and the first/last time my parents saw the little kids. They did not come to my wedding. (We invited them out of respect and not wanting to exclude any of my dad’s few relatives).

Tonight, the daughter messaged me on Facebook to tell me that her daughter is having another baby boy, and that the baby’s middle name will be my dad’s first name. I’m devastated. We would not recognize these people passing in the street. My dad would recognize his sister, but not his niece/her kids. They have had nothing to do with us and vice versa. Aside from the wedding, the only contact they’ve made is when asking for money or gifts. They didn’t send a card when he died, much less call. My older sister thinks this is a roundabout way to get us to send money/gifts to them, but I wouldn’t give them that much credit IMO.

I replied to her message with “That is an interesting choice to make, seeing as how my dad does not know you or your children and vice versa.” She has not seen/responded.

I realize I can’t force them to change the name, but IMO it’s ridiculous/bizarre to name a whole ass child after someone you do not know and who meant nothing to you, and disrespectful/clueless to message me and tell me as if I should be happy about this. I also feel robbed of the ability to honor my OWN DAD by naming a future child after him (married, no kids yet). what do you all think?",my dad died this past may after an extremely long battle with lung disease a lung transplant and the complications of the transplant he died almost years after receiving the transplant there was a lot of suffering both mentally and physically experienced by my dad of course but also my momsistersmyself i won’t go into detail but the last two years have been extremely challenging for us all my dad had a sister and they are estranged i could not recognize her passing in the street and they have probably spoken less than times in the years i’ve been alive his sister has two kids a son and daughter both older than i am the only time the son has ’shown’ up in our lives is when he called our house to ask my dad for money writing this post i can’t even remember what his name is the daughter friended me on facebook years ago and did occasionally ask me how my dad was when he was at his sickest mostly to share with her mom my dad’s sister her daughter and her daughter’s kids showed up to my older sister’s wedding in they sat in the car during the outdoor ceremony the weather was beautiful and left immediately after that was the firstlast time we saw them and the firstlast time my parents saw the little kids they did not come to my wedding we invited them out of respect and not wanting to exclude any of my dad’s few relatives tonight the daughter messaged me on facebook to tell me that her daughter is having another baby boy and that the baby’s middle name will be my dad’s first name i’m devastated we would not recognize these people passing in the street my dad would recognize his sister but not his nieceher kids they have had nothing to do with us and vice versa aside from the wedding the only contact they’ve made is when asking for money or gifts they didn’t send a card when he died much less call my older sister thinks this is a roundabout way to get us to send moneygifts to them but i wouldn’t give them that much credit imo i replied to her message with “that is an interesting choice to make seeing as how my dad does not know you or your children and vice versa” she has not seenresponded i realize i can’t force them to change the name but imo it’s ridiculousbizarre to name a whole ass child after someone you do not know and who meant nothing to you and disrespectfulclueless to message me and tell me as if i should be happy about this i also feel robbed of the ability to honor my own dad by naming a future child after him married no kids yet what do you all think,479,YTA

It was a friday night, I had arranged to meet up with a group of friends. We were going to drink and have fun playing some games after a stressful week of college tests. I organized everything to receive them and prepared myself to be a good hostess, I was taught hospitality and to always make sure that the guests were comfortable. Anyway, everyone arrived, we started to eat and talk, until one of the friends gave us the idea to move the furniture from the living room to play with VR, we were going to take turns and watch all of us playing a horror game in VR and laugh at the situation. I started removing the furniture from the living room, there weren't that many, so I asked them to just wait, the help really wasn't needed. Until it was time to carry an old armchair, it was heavier than other furniture, so my sister who lives with me helped me carry it, but I hadn't noticed that there underneath a backpack and a jacket on the armchair there was a Mac. Unfortunately, the accident happened, at a certain moment we tilted the chair too much and everything fell down and the Mac broke. (It doesn't change the situation, but both of us were sober) I was shocked by the situation, so was the owner of the notebook (she is one of my closest friends in the group). The atmosphere became tense, because she was very upset. At the end of the night, after everyone had left, by messages, we were deciding on the prices and how we were going to solve the problem. The next day, I was told about private conversations of other colleagues talking about this situation in which I was called a jerk for not offering to pay for the repair entirely. Until then it was just an unpleasant situation that could be solved quickly, but some people in the group decided to get involved and give their opinions. The only thing I could think of to defend myself in this situation is that the Macbook was in the wrong place, where anyone could sit, totally unprotected without a protective cover or inside the backpack. But I accept the view that I might be wrong, as I could have checked the situation better and taken the objects off the armchair before moving it. Maybe I should be more aware of people and their objects in my home, or maybe people should take care of their personal objects in environments that are not their home, I really don't know, I don't have an opinion. We are still sorting out the financial part, for now we have decided to split expenses in half, but some friends of hers have convinced her that I should take over all the expenses, making the conversation uncomfortable and a bit awkward. This situation is being a bit stressful and creating intrigue with a friend that I wouldn't want to lose. I don't know if I am wrong or right, some friends are divided, some have even said that I shouldn't pay for anything. This is creating intrigue and discussion in our social circle.

Rent, hotel rooms, and Airbnbs are expensive in my city, so my friend asked if he could crash at my place as he interviews for jobs. I've been letting him stay for free. 

He has been a good roommate overall, being quiet and clean. However, he asks to go out a lot to explore the city and we have been going to bars and restaurants very frequently. He has been good about splitting the bill down the middle, but he is very very quick to always Venmo me half of every single uber ride, drink, meal, etc. that we do.

He is about to leave, and I told him that it's been really nice hosting him but I've also allowed him to stay for three weeks for completely free and going out so frequently has been expensive for me, and that it'd appreciate it if he's willing to treat me to a nice dinner & drinks just once before he leaves instead of constantly Venmoing me for my half. 

He got upset at me, saying I didn't give any expectation that he would have to ""treat me"" and that I am being ""passive aggressive"" and that he's ""not a mind reader"" and he has been Venmoing me and splitting the bill on things because that's the right thing to do (which I don't dispute). I said I wasn't that upset, but it would be a good faith gesture because I like to treat whoever hosts me and he's stayed a while, but he thinks it's rude of me to ask that of him ""especially as he is still trying to land a job"" (although he has been paying for his half of the meals through savings), and that my comment may make us end our time together on a ""bad note."" 

I understand that he is not objectively doing anything wrong - I told him he could crash for free for three weeks and he has been splitting all the bills. But I would have liked a gesture of goodwill or thoughtfulness of him treating me out at least once, and once I asked that of him, he found it rude and aggressive and ""entitled.""

175,yizwkt,AITA for paying my cousins back for a gift for me?,paying my cousins back for a gift for me,"So recently, I (19M) went to Malaysia to visit my extended family there. We were close growing up and have still been close until now but I haven't been able to see them for over 3 years because of the travel ban.

Anyways, while I was there, I bought one of my cousins (he was the youngest of five and since the economy there is quite bad, he had mainly only gotten hand-me-downs) a pair of Air Jordans for RM 800 (approx USD$169) and a few days later, when I was about to fly back home, his older siblings wanted to buy me gifts on my way back.

I insisted no and said there is no need for them to buy me anything as I had a great time there and I cannot accept gifts from them considering the horrible conversion rate they were receiving, anything for me would be too expensive for them (USD$1 = 4.73 RM). But they had actually bought a bunch of clothes and accessories for me while we were out in secret and somehow snuck them all in my luggage and I only found out about them when I got home.

There wasn't a receipt either but when I tallied everything up based on estimation, I estimated that they had given me RM 1000 worth of gift. I know they're financially stable. But when I thought about it, while those gifts are about USD$200 for me, they're easily spending RM 1000 and I just felt bad accepting it so I PayPal'ed their eldest sibling for the gifts and thanked them but said I couldn't accept it since it was a lot coming from them.

He ended up texting me back saying I was an AH for rejecting their good intentions and for ""indirectly calling them poor"" when that wasn't my intention at all. I told my mom about it and she agreed I was in the wrong for sending the money back as it came across that I was a snobby AH who looked down on their social status. Anyways I apologized to him and asked my grandmother to explain to them that it wasn't my intention to come across as snobby and explained my reasoning behind it and we're cool now but I'm just really puzzled if I was an AH for returning their money.

AITA?",so recently i m went to malaysia to visit my extended family there we were close growing up and have still been close until now but i havent been able to see them for over years because of the travel ban anyways while i was there i bought one of my cousins he was the youngest of five and since the economy there is quite bad he had mainly only gotten handmedowns a pair of air jordans for rm approx usd and a few days later when i was about to fly back home his older siblings wanted to buy me gifts on my way back i insisted no and said there is no need for them to buy me anything as i had a great time there and i cannot accept gifts from them considering the horrible conversion rate they were receiving anything for me would be too expensive for them usd rm but they had actually bought a bunch of clothes and accessories for me while we were out in secret and somehow snuck them all in my luggage and i only found out about them when i got home there wasnt a receipt either but when i tallied everything up based on estimation i estimated that they had given me rm worth of gift i know theyre financially stable but when i thought about it while those gifts are about usd for me theyre easily spending rm and i just felt bad accepting it so i paypaled their eldest sibling for the gifts and thanked them but said i couldnt accept it since it was a lot coming from them he ended up texting me back saying i was an ah for rejecting their good intentions and for indirectly calling them poor when that wasnt my intention at all i told my mom about it and she agreed i was in the wrong for sending the money back as it came across that i was a snobby ah who looked down on their social status anyways i apologized to him and asked my grandmother to explain to them that it wasnt my intention to come across as snobby and explained my reasoning behind it and were cool now but im just really puzzled if i was an ah for returning their money,386,YTA
178,yhd8ta,AITA for humiliating MIL at a family dinner when she wouldn't stop going on about grandchildren?,humiliating mil at a family dinner when she wouldnt stop going on about grandchildren,"Please don't post this elsewhere (aka tiktok, YouTube).

I (27f) haven't gotten along with my MIL for the better part of my relationship with my partner (27m). She has said a lot of mean things about me that are honestly just childish and cruel (I won't get into the he said she said stuff). I've become exhausted with her, especially as I've moved into my career, moved town and am in the process of getting married/ buying a house. In the past few years shes taken to outright ignoring me, speaking over me, pretending i dont exist. As a result, I've mentally checked out from trying to make things working with her and in part so has my partner. Let me make it clear, I support whatever relationship he wants to have with her, but I'm done trying to be her friend. 

We were at a family dinner party (my partner asked me to come along) recently where she started asking him about when he's having children. She kept pestering him and asking when she's getting grand babies and that she wants children around. This has been something shes been harping on a lot about lately and its getting on my nerves. My partner asked her to stop several times but she kept bringing it up. I was sat there silent for a bit, but I think the wine got the best of me so I kinda snapped. I turned to her and started asking what she wants to know about our *private* life?? What kind of protection we're using, what positions we've tried, what toys we use. I started to list them all. Lets just say I used very inappropriate language for a dinner table, even throwing in a ""do you have any pointers for me, or maybe it'd be best if you just came and watched to make sure we're doing it right"". At this point she was yelling at me, having a go at my partner for ""letting"" me speak to her like that and crying about how mean I am. We got up shortly after and left.  

My partner thinks I took it a bit far in front of his family, and his aunties have said it was wildly uncalled for and mean. I don't really feel bad for it though, should I?

AITA?

ETA: I'm infertile. She isn't aware of this, I'd never give her that info to weaponise against me. But just for the people commenting to keep kids away from her, I won't have any to keep away from her but thank you for the advice. I know your hearts in the right place.  My partner has told her several times we won't be having children and to drop it. Since my partner always wanted children, she's assumed that I simply don't want children and am taking that away from him.

UPDATE: 
Thank you all for the replies! I appreciate the people giving some reasoning behind YTA and ESH. I normally go to my friends about these things but I worry it's maybe a bit of an echo chamber, they're so supportive and might not call me out on my BS. I can say I've read most, if not all the replies, and I still don't feel that bad about what I said (sorry YTA and ESH people!). 

MIL has since messaged my partner, I won't put the exact wording. But she has said that she ""knows"" I'm the cause of her not having grandchildren and she's disappointed in him for being with me. She also said how grandchildren are a basic right, and even if they are half carrot_sloth89's children, she would still find it in her heart to love them and shape them into good people. 

My partner blocked her after that. I know a few people suggested I just tell her I'm infertile, but the way she weaponises information is honestly terrifying. Some other people said that my partner should say he is infertile, and I think that's a valid option, but for now he wants no contact. 

Some people have suggested adoption. Thank you, I know it's coming from a good place, I just want to wait a while before considering children. I don't want to bring in a child that will likely have considerable trauma themselves into a house where I haven't fully healed. It's not fair on them. I'd also never want them to think they're filling a void just because we couldn't have children naturally, that's a heavy burden to place on a tiny person. I also think I'd like to do some pre-adoption therapy (if that's a thing lol) for a year or maybe even some classes to better educate myself on how best to adopt and raise an adopted child. I'm not about continuing any cycles of abuse here. Also, if we do adopt MIL won't meet them. I'd hate for her to say anything nasty or hurtful because they aren't ""blood related"".

183,yiplrh,AITA for wanting to bring a nerf gun during trick or treating?,wanting to bring a nerf gun during trick or treating,"So I'm a 21 F and I absolutely love Halloween, I try to spend as much time as I can when it comes to my costumes, mostly the props since sewing is too advanced for me, and this year I decided to be a triangle guard from squid game because ever since it came out last year I had wanted to be a character from it because I love the show.

Now, I'm too old to go trick or treating by myself without it seeming questionable but I have some step siblings, the oldest of them is married with a kid in middle school and they're not from the country so they never really got to go trick or treating and I wanted to give the kid a fun experience. Now back to the matter at hand, as the triangle guard, they're known to be the ones with the weapons and they eliminate the rule breakers or the players who fail their task, that's literally their job, so I wanted to be more into the role of the character and I got a nerf gun, the model is the Fortnite BASR-L Bolt Action that I spray painted black and have added some pink, logos, symbols, even a quote from the show on it. However, my stepdad says that if I bring it with trick or treating, I'll be putting his grandkid in danger because it looks too much like a real gun. Well, its supposed to look like a gun first of all, second, I've customized it and I doubt anyone will see a squid game soldier with a black and pink gun with paper logos taped onto it threatening. My mom takes his side like always and she tells me I need to leave it.

Here's the thing, I'm currently jobless without any income because I was in the hospital 3 different times from emotional distress, I wont go into detail because this post is long enough, and this gun with the supplies costed over $40 and I have very little money but I wanted this Halloween to be just as fun as my other ones with my costumes but this $40 is a lot of money to me with no income, since it was already painted, I can't return it and it's basically $40 completely wasted.

I've asked my step sister and she says it's fine and her husband is actually encouraging me to bring it, I've told a friend and she says that I'm in the right to be upset and that I'm old enough and I don't need to be told what to do by my parents. But I want to see what other people will think, maybe I'm in the wrong and if I am, I need help understanding why. So, am I the asshole if I bring a nerf gun trick or treating?

Also the area we live in is mostly LDS families and college students, so It's not like there's sketchy activity or anything like that.

Edit: Just from the few comments from the last few minutes alone have helped me see why its a bad idea, I'm going to leave the gun at home and I'm going to apologize to my mom and step-dad for thinking their concerns were invalid. Thanks for helping me come to this realization.",so im a f and i absolutely love halloween i try to spend as much time as i can when it comes to my costumes mostly the props since sewing is too advanced for me and this year i decided to be a triangle guard from squid game because ever since it came out last year i had wanted to be a character from it because i love the show now im too old to go trick or treating by myself without it seeming questionable but i have some step siblings the oldest of them is married with a kid in middle school and theyre not from the country so they never really got to go trick or treating and i wanted to give the kid a fun experience now back to the matter at hand as the triangle guard theyre known to be the ones with the weapons and they eliminate the rule breakers or the players who fail their task thats literally their job so i wanted to be more into the role of the character and i got a nerf gun the model is the fortnite basrl bolt action that i spray painted black and have added some pink logos symbols even a quote from the show on it however my stepdad says that if i bring it with trick or treating ill be putting his grandkid in danger because it looks too much like a real gun well its supposed to look like a gun first of all second ive customized it and i doubt anyone will see a squid game soldier with a black and pink gun with paper logos taped onto it threatening my mom takes his side like always and she tells me i need to leave it heres the thing im currently jobless without any income because i was in the hospital different times from emotional distress i wont go into detail because this post is long enough and this gun with the supplies costed over and i have very little money but i wanted this halloween to be just as fun as my other ones with my costumes but this is a lot of money to me with no income since it was already painted i cant return it and its basically completely wasted ive asked my step sister and she says its fine and her husband is actually encouraging me to bring it ive told a friend and she says that im in the right to be upset and that im old enough and i dont need to be told what to do by my parents but i want to see what other people will think maybe im in the wrong and if i am i need help understanding why so am i the asshole if i bring a nerf gun trick or treating also the area we live in is mostly lds families and college students so its not like theres sketchy activity or anything like that edit just from the few comments from the last few minutes alone have helped me see why its a bad idea im going to leave the gun at home and im going to apologize to my mom and stepdad for thinking their concerns were invalid thanks for helping me come to this realization,551,YTA

The oldest one has been there for me for ages and always cuddled up to me if i was sad. I was and still am very attached to him.

Now a few days ago we sadly had to say goodbye to the oldest and all 3 of us were devistated, the death happened at the vet after he got a blood clot in his heart. Now 5 days have passed and it was my first day working again, since the death took a toll on me. I am still very upset and mentioning him still makes me cry as im still grieving. 
My dad took it a bit better and while SM seemed just as sad as i was the day it happened it almost feels like it isn't affecting her anymore. I know different people grieve in other ways but it just rubbed me the wrong way.
On my way home today she texted me a picture of another kitten who was around 16 weeks and needed a new home. I told her the kitten was cute but asked if it wasnt too fast for a new cat. She replied that our other cat looked lonely and upset and that he needs a new buddy. I just replied with an ""okay"" and waited for the conversation to continue at home.

When i got home not 10 minutes later she told me we could go and meet the new kitten tomorrow, i just didn't know what to respond. To me it all felt way too quick for a new kitten in the house. When I didn't respond she asked me if I dont want to go look and i answered honestly; i think its too fast for a new kitten and not a good idea. She replied that she would cancel the appointment and just walked away. I started to feel bad and asked if she was mad at me and SM only said she was dissapointed. After that she did not really seem wanting to talk to me and now i feel bad but i dont think i did anything wrong?

193,yj2hat,AITA for getting myself water from behind the bar?,getting myself water from behind the bar,"I was at a pub for an evening with friends. It's a two level establishment, with a quiet section upstairs that we're at. I know there was one empty table on the upper level the whole night, but I don't know how busy downstairs was. I've been here before and they've sometimes had a ""help yourself"" water jug and glasses on the bar in the past, though this wasn't the case tonight.

I don't drink, but I ordered an appetizer and water. My appetizer comes in decent time, but then the waiter disappears.

Over an hour later, no water has arrived for me (though two friends who ordered a drink and water had their water arrive). My group hasn't ordered another round in a while and I realize there's no server in sight.

I'm really thirsty by now, so I get up and and look for water. There's a bar upstairs, but the server is nowhere in sight. The whole floor has been left unattended; presumably our server is downstairs.

I assume they're busy and look for a water glass and jug. No dice. But there is the bar tap (no barrier or sign in the way). I go behind the bar and fill up a glass with water. Sit back down, drink it. A few minutes later I've drained my glass and want more water. Still no server in sight, so I go behind the bar again and fill my glass with water.

Just then the server reappears up the stairs, and they are livid when they see me behind the bar. I get a dressing down that it's illegal for a customer to step behind the bar (with the fact that it serves alcohol I probably should have had some inkling, but it didn't occur to me, the non drinker, at the time).

I explain that my water never arrived, and I didn't see her anywhere so I thought to fill my glass up myself. The server says they did in fact serve my water, and points to a friend's water. The friend says it's theirs as the server storms off, making a point of shutting the (previously unseen and unused) half-door thingy into the bar. They avoid my table for the rest of the evening, and when I settle the bill I apologize. I get another dressing down, making the table quite awkward. I know at this point that I did an absolute no-no. I say goodbye to my friends, leave a $10 tip on my $10 appetizer and walk out, not saying anything more to the server.

Am I the asshole here? Did they over-react, or am I lucky I wasn't barred from the establishment? I'd also love to know if the act of a customer stepping behind the bar itself is actually illegal or if it's more of a health code/insurance/don't look like you're trying to steal a drink thing.",i was at a pub for an evening with friends its a two level establishment with a quiet section upstairs that were at i know there was one empty table on the upper level the whole night but i dont know how busy downstairs was ive been here before and theyve sometimes had a help yourself water jug and glasses on the bar in the past though this wasnt the case tonight i dont drink but i ordered an appetizer and water my appetizer comes in decent time but then the waiter disappears over an hour later no water has arrived for me though two friends who ordered a drink and water had their water arrive my group hasnt ordered another round in a while and i realize theres no server in sight im really thirsty by now so i get up and and look for water theres a bar upstairs but the server is nowhere in sight the whole floor has been left unattended presumably our server is downstairs i assume theyre busy and look for a water glass and jug no dice but there is the bar tap no barrier or sign in the way i go behind the bar and fill up a glass with water sit back down drink it a few minutes later ive drained my glass and want more water still no server in sight so i go behind the bar again and fill my glass with water just then the server reappears up the stairs and they are livid when they see me behind the bar i get a dressing down that its illegal for a customer to step behind the bar with the fact that it serves alcohol i probably should have had some inkling but it didnt occur to me the non drinker at the time i explain that my water never arrived and i didnt see her anywhere so i thought to fill my glass up myself the server says they did in fact serve my water and points to a friends water the friend says its theirs as the server storms off making a point of shutting the previously unseen and unused halfdoor thingy into the bar they avoid my table for the rest of the evening and when i settle the bill i apologize i get another dressing down making the table quite awkward i know at this point that i did an absolute nono i say goodbye to my friends leave a tip on my appetizer and walk out not saying anything more to the server am i the asshole here did they overreact or am i lucky i wasnt barred from the establishment id also love to know if the act of a customer stepping behind the bar itself is actually illegal or if its more of a health codeinsurancedont look like youre trying to steal a drink thing,483,ESH

204,yioisd,AITA for not responding after being treated badly this weekend?,not responding after being treated badly this weekend,"I(21F) have small friend group. One of the girls in the group is under 21 so it hard for us to go to bars/clubs without making her feel left out. On the 29th one of my favorite bars was doing a Halloween event that seemed like fun. So I suggested that on Friday we would go to house parties so everyone could go together then on Saturday we would go to the bars It seemed like a win win. 

leading up to Halloweekend I noticed that a party flyer was going around. It was a party hosted by the girl who is under 21. I only found out about the party because I seen the flyer posted on someone instagram story. Nobody told me about it. 


On the 27th I asked the group what was the plan for Saturday. I gave them the opportunity to bring up the party but nothing. Later that night I got left alone with the party host girl. She was talking about the party and I said I didn’t know if I’m  are going cause Im going to the bars. She said I should stop by and insisted I go. 

28th we were supposed to start at 8 I called them and they were still getting ready. 8 turn to 9 then 9 turn to 10 and I got no updates so I called again. I felt so embarrassed. When 11 hit I decided to go out somewhere else until they were ready. I only stayed for 30 minutes when they finally said they were ready and sent me the address to meet them. we were 3 hours late so it didn’t seem to be still going. My friend was already drunk and the girls in the group were openly judging her. I helped her then I came back to the group and they started talking about the plans for the 29th. They said “so we were thinking we could come for two hours then leave and go to her party”  weren’t including me in the plans. It seems like they already had this plan set and weren’t asking me they were telling me what was going to happen. I felt so excluded so I just left. 

29th hit I didn’t hear from anyone. They called my friend but not me to talk about the plans. Still excluding us from the house party plans. They didn't message me once which was weird. My friend from home got uncomfortable being the middle man so she lied to text me. They didn’t text me until two hours before the bar event started Saying that one didn’t get a ticket yet and someone else wanted to go but didn’t know if they were still selling tickets. Excuses. 

When it was time to go they said to go without them because they were still getting ready. I told them no rush because but they insisted on riding separately. I asked them later if they were there yet and she told me they weren’t going and that they were at the house party.

The 30th they called me and I didn’t pick up I was still pissed and hangover. I had a good night still but it made me mad had they was still acting like everything was fine.

For example, I may express interest  in a horse related topic and my mom may reply 'Or  you could be spending your type applying to college' and my dad would chip in 'Or apply and get a real job'.. this has been going on for MONTHS.

At the beginning  of September  we got into a big argument  where I tried to explain my side and how I mentally cannot handle going to college right now even though it would be my dream. How I love my job and even if I get paid less, the people are amazing, It's a job I know I can handle, and I gain valuable  experience  through riding other people's horses outside my own. I refused to listen to their advice and because of it, I was told that I was ""Looking for a roommate situation"" and not to be a part or this family, and thus I would be required to pay rent.
  
  Tomorrow  marks month 2 of paying  rent, and up until Yesterday, I thought I was justified with my decision to stay with the job I have until my family was hanging out with family friends. They were asking me about  my future  plans, and my mom brought up that they want me to get a real job. The family friends asked me multiple  questions about why I don't want to get the job my parents  want me to get, and what makes me think my current  job is better. By the end of the conversation, though they didn't outright say it they made it very clear they sided with my parents. 

So now I'm wondering if I should just listen to my parents and get a real job, and If I'm being a jerk for not listening to their advice. I understand that they want what's best for me, and if I get a real job I'll get paid more, but I'm very happy with where I am in life even if it isn't what I had originally wanted. I will have a different job eventually, as soon as I go back to college, but right now I don't feel the need to. I make enough money to pay for my phone, car, gas, and now rent plus  have been putting money away into savings.

AITA?",i f still live with my parents and this has been a long time issue with them i currently work on a horse farm as a working student i get paid hr with free riding lessons and i get paid under the table i love my job and though its hard work its enjoyable and something that works well for me because i have adhd despite how much i love my job my parents think its a waste because the state doesnt recognize me as being employed therfore my dad says i dont have a real job and i need to get one this started after i dropped out of college due to doing poorly in it i wish i could go back to school as i aim to be a livestock vet but due to untreatedonly in the past month have i started treatment adhd and the pandemic im mentally unable to do it at the moment my parents have been pressuring me since i started doing bad in college to just try harder and do more classes even when im doing my best my parents are constantly making off hand comments in reply to things i say for example i may express interest in a horse related topic and my mom may reply or you could be spending your type applying to college and my dad would chip in or apply and get a real job this has been going on for months at the beginning of september we got into a big argument where i tried to explain my side and how i mentally cannot handle going to college right now even though it would be my dream how i love my job and even if i get paid less the people are amazing its a job i know i can handle and i gain valuable experience through riding other peoples horses outside my own i refused to listen to their advice and because of it i was told that i was looking for a roommate situation and not to be a part or this family and thus i would be required to pay rent tomorrow marks month of paying rent and up until yesterday i thought i was justified with my decision to stay with the job i have until my family was hanging out with family friends they were asking me about my future plans and my mom brought up that they want me to get a real job the family friends asked me multiple questions about why i dont want to get the job my parents want me to get and what makes me think my current job is better by the end of the conversation though they didnt outright say it they made it very clear they sided with my parents so now im wondering if i should just listen to my parents and get a real job and if im being a jerk for not listening to their advice i understand that they want whats best for me and if i get a real job ill get paid more but im very happy with where i am in life even if it isnt what i had originally wanted i will have a different job eventually as soon as i go back to college but right now i dont feel the need to i make enough money to pay for my phone car gas and now rent plus have been putting money away into savings,583,NAH
221,yhfmkn,AITA for not telling my wife about our son's broken arm?,not telling my wife about our sons broken arm,"Backstory, I(42 M) have been with my wife Janet (40 F) for 16 yrs.  We have one son Jack (11 M). 

Before we started dating, my wife, her mom and sister have dreamed about doing a girls trip together.  They've never pulled the trigger, but they talk about it at least twice a yr.  So for a combined birthday/Christmas gift for everyone I booked and paid for a 7 night cruise for the 3 of them.  Everyone was super excited and I was husband/ inlaw of the year. 

Well.... 2 days into the cruise and my son, being a boy, broke his arm.  We rushed him to the doctor and he's holding up great.  Break wasn't severe and his cast isn't covering his entire arm in the permanent hand raise position. 

Here is where I might be the AH.  I didn't tell my wife when it happened.  My initial thought was to immediately call her, but then I thought it through.  1.  I didn't have an easy way to call. She's on a cruise with no cell service.  I'm sure there is way to contact her, but I didn't have it ready. 2.  There was nothing she could do.  Was she going to cut it short and get a crazy expensive 1 way flight to come home?  I didn't want to worry her.  3.  Our son was fine!  He was upset he had to wait for the swelling to go down to get a cast, bc he wanted everyone to sign it.  4. She was going to be home when the cast went on.

So I didn't tell my wife till I picked her up.  Now everyone is calling me an AH for keeping that information from her.  She is mad at me and giving me the slient trestment.  Somehow by not telling her I also ruined the trip. I just wanted her to enjoy a trip she's been talking about for almost 2 decades.  

Was I wrong?

226,yihzwq,AITA for not relenting about organization in shared spaces of our new apartment and driving one of my roommates to possibly move out?,not relenting about organization in shared spaces of our new apartment and driving one of my roommates to possibly move out," So I 21f recently moved into an apartment with two of my friends who we’ll call Lola 21f and Abby 19f. Lola and I have been living together for two years but Abby was a new addition. I’ve known Abby since high school but we weren’t exactly close friends during that time. In the last year we have been hanging out more and more and have gotten closer. So we all decided to get our first apartment near our college campus together.

Something to understand about me is that I have intense OCD tendencies due to trauma that I experienced both from my parents and from another incident a year and a half ago. I am currently trying to work on it with my therapist but it's a struggle. Both my roommates knew of this before we moved in. Lola doesn’t have a problem with me having control of the organization since it keeps everything nice and clean. Abby, despite saying it was alright, has fought me on everything since day one.

She has been unwilling to compromise in many situations and caused a lot of stress and anxiety for Lola and I. It doesn’t help that Abby and my dad are incredibly close and really good friends. He even takes her side on many of the issues and has teamed up with her on occasion to try and prove Lola and I wrong. I have been feeling very trapped in this situation since she’s always over at my parents house and my dad will usually reprimand me for not “allowing” Abby something when all I’ve ever tried to do is compromise for both of our comfort.

I understand that living with someone with OCD can be very challenging but I have tried so many different things to allow us both comfortable living. Recently, we had our biggest disagreement yet and it was when she put her groceries out and above the cabinets despite there being a free bin for her to use so that the groceries don’t show. It really bothers me and causes me anxiety. I bought her the bin to try and help but she says it's too hard to use. I tried to compromise and move my stuff to a higher cabinet so she could take the easier to reach cabinet but she basically said that if she can’t use the space normally then she will move back in with her parents and not pay utilities. This caused me to have a breakdown in the kitchen that Lola had to talk me down from. I’m now losing sleep over the issue because I know that something isn’t right in the home and I’ve had constant overwhelming anxiety ever since. My hands also shake now as a result.

I want her to be comfortable in her home since it is a shared living space but I also believe everyone should be comfortable. She has also brought up issues in the past just to get a rise out of me and has told me as such when I inquired about her not following through with our compromises. I just need to know if I’m in the wrong for pushing her to this point.

228,yh9ss6,AITA for not going to my girlfriends sons funeral?,not going to my girlfriends sons funeral,"I (28m) have been dating my girlfriend  (30f) for 2 months. I think we had a good relationship, she has a son (11m). My girlfriend and I were good friends for a few years, we met through a mutual friends and so I haven’t spent time with her alone until 5 months ago.

I knew she had a son, because she’s posted about him on Facebook, a few times. He has some sort of liver condition and was awaiting a liver transplant. its just him and his mom.
I don’t know much about him, as my gf Is very reserved talking about her son.

I have a little sister (26f). I have always been closer to her than other siblings, considering we’re only a few years apart.  when she was 11, we were fighting at school and she ended up fainting. She had to stay in the hospital for a few days to have some tests done, and she ended up being diagnosed with diabetes, not related to her death. 

I think it changed the dynamic of our relationship a lot, because she was in hospital a lot more than other kids.

At the start of September, my gfs son started getting sicker, and it was the first time she ever opened up to me about his health conditions.

In early October my  sister got into an accident. It was very sudden, and because she still lives near my parents they were heartbroken, and they don’t have any children apart from my sister and I, so I went to help them.

I Grew up in Australia, and my sister and my family still live there, I live in America currently. For the funeral and to console my mum and dad, I decided to stay there for 10days to help plan the funeral.

On my second day there, I got a call from my gf. She said her son had passed away during the night, I tried to help her the best I could even though I was already sad about the death of my sister. She said she wanted the funeral to be done soon, and that it would happen on the 6th day of my ten day trip. My sisters funeral was on the 8th and I wasn’t going to take two flights to there and two flights back in less than 2 days to go to both.

My gf got really upset, and said that I didn’t care about her son, and I was upset at her too becuase i had just lost my sister. She told me that her son thought of me like a dad, and I’d never met him so I told her I didn’t think of him like a son. She hung up angrily and we haven’t spoken since.

I’ll admit I was harsh telling her, and a grieving mother didn’t deserve that, however I don’t think I was wrong to push the idea of me being this kids dad.

All my mutual friends think I’m the A-hole for not going, and that I should’ve told her later, but she knows I’ve never met her son, and I wouldn’t ditch my sisters funeral to go to her sons. My friends though think I did the right thing and I wasn’t obligated to go to his funeral.

I don’t know what I should’ve done, I’m glad I went to my sisters funeral but I feel bad for how I told my gf as her sons never had a father figure in his life.

Edit: thank you all for these kind words, I’m very glad for all the support on this. I have read lots of comment before, however I’ve been waiting to give you an update on my and my gf.

My gf and I aren’t together anymore, I’ve cut ties with her, not out of spite as some of the earlier comments said, but because I don’t think seither of us are ready, we are both grieving important people in our lives now. 

I have heard from a freind of a freind(also a mutual freind who’s not that close) who’s friends with my ex gf she is still very upset and angry at me for my comment that ‘he’s not my son’ and so I haven’t spoken to a lot of my more distant mutual friends. A lot of them have been friends with my ex gf for years and have heard lots about her son, whereas not much about my sister as it was so sudden, so are still upset at me for not going, so I haven’t spoken to them much either.

I (25 F) have been friends with Rob(25 M) since college. We both didn’t really have friends since the college we attended was out of our home states and we often studied together which led to us becoming close friends. Obviously, we are still close but just not as much. We still talk on the phone and hangout occasionally. 

Rob started seeing “Ariana” (22 F) during our last year of college. They have been officially dating for two years. As the title shows, we don’t really like each other. Our personalities could not be more opposite. She was/is always into being girly, chatty, and just a lot. It’s just not what I prefer. Also it got worse when me and Ariana got into an argument a year ago during my Halloween party that led us to REALLY disliking each other. I host the Halloween party every year, the Saturday before Halloween. Because of everything I stated, I didn’t invite her again. When Rob called Friday night to asked what “they” should bring I told him I just invited him and not Ariana. He apologized for making an assumption but then told me to count one off the list because he won’t be attending. This upset me because he has never missed my Halloween party before. I asked if she really couldn’t be alone for one night. He said it wasn’t about her it was just his decision to not go somewhere that excluded his girlfriend.

If you ask about it, she gets very defensive and claims she doesn’t want to talk about it, however she generally talks about it all the time, making it a personality trait at this point. For the OCD, same case. Talks about it all the time.

Maybe she actually doesn’t know? But the more I think about it it sounds fake. I told her that people actually have issues with these disorders and that she shouldn’t be thinking it’s a cool thing to have. Her reply, “stop yelling at me your going to flare up my ocd”.

249,yiq1oc,WIBTA if I confronted my dad about his cheating?,wibta if i confronted my dad about his cheating,"Context: My (23m) parents have been divorced for a decade, and my dad remarried a couple years later. At the time, I voiced my disapproval of his new relationship, which led to him saying a lot of hurtful things. At their wedding (eight years ago at the time of writing), I discovered he had cheated on my mom with his now wife. I never confronted him about it because I'm convinced he wouldn't care about my feelings and say a bunch of hurtful things again.

I recently realized how holding onto this family secret has negatively affected my life and that it's finally time to confront him. I planned on have a private dinner where I would tell him what I know and ask him to confess to my siblings too, since I'm confident that I'm the only one of the three of us who knows. Where I fear I will be the asshole is that I plan on doing it before a family trip. It has come to my attention that we might be meeting my dad's wife's family on this trip, which is where I draw the line. I have managed to get away with not meeting them before, and I would like it to stay that way because I do not view his wife or her family as my family because of his cheating (I even refuse to call her my stepmom). A part of me is worried that this will cause me to have an outburst on the trip, which further cemented to me why it's time to have this secret out in the open, and that it should happen before we leave.

251,yipv8r,AITA for leaving my friend group to help my friends who got robbed,leaving my friend group to help my friends who got robbed," 

Yesterday was halloween, my friends met up and we all kind of hung around a shopping centre called an IGA (australia) before one of my best friends, tyler, came over and said that his friends would come over and that we need to meet them. Another of my best friends, steve, said they'd come with and asked me to stay behind to get candy from houses and keep an eye on my friends and to meet up at the oval of a park nearby at 7:00 PM.

fast forward a few hours and steve calls another friend, saying ""hey are you guys coming, it's 7:00 PM we need to meet up"". The other friend asks where and he says ""at the kumon park"" (kumon is the name of an education thing that i used to go to and it was right next to the park). apparently nobody thinks of telling me anything because they all decide to bunch up and head to a completely different place before steve calls again, sounding more pissed off; ""pass the phone to TheEqualizer1212"", they give me the phone and i hear where he meant to meet up and i tell the group to start moving in that direction, however, i am known as the group dumbass so literally nobody follows me and then after a while, steve calls me again, sounding incredibly pissed off ""Dude i got fucking robbed by some dickheads who go to our school"" (he specified who it was, im just not mentioning it because this is the internet.), i tell the group that he got robbed and that he sounded very pissed and they all dont believe me and start scouring more houses for candy. Eventually i get pissed right the fuck off that nobody wants to help my friends who got robbed and say ""you know what? Fuck this!"" and start running in the direction that he wanted us to go to.

i get there and he asks where the group is and i tell him the truth; nobody believed him, thought i was lying, started scouring the neighbourhood for candy, and, he gets even more pissed off that nobody believed him, his friends get pissed off too that they had to fight people for their shit and nobody but me came to help, my mates, steve, tyler and their friends never got any candy because they were meeting up and trying to not get robbed. i gave them my candy and stuck with them, eventually we told tyler and his friends to leave and enjoy halloween, found the group, tried to ask why the fuck they didnt believe us and their excuse was: ""he said it in a way that didn't sound like it was true!"" and then victimised themselves, screamed at me and steve and we both left angry. tommorrow will be an interesting school day.",yesterday was halloween my friends met up and we all kind of hung around a shopping centre called an iga australia before one of my best friends tyler came over and said that his friends would come over and that we need to meet them another of my best friends steve said theyd come with and asked me to stay behind to get candy from houses and keep an eye on my friends and to meet up at the oval of a park nearby at pm fast forward a few hours and steve calls another friend saying hey are you guys coming its pm we need to meet up the other friend asks where and he says at the kumon park kumon is the name of an education thing that i used to go to and it was right next to the park apparently nobody thinks of telling me anything because they all decide to bunch up and head to a completely different place before steve calls again sounding more pissed off pass the phone to theequalizer they give me the phone and i hear where he meant to meet up and i tell the group to start moving in that direction however i am known as the group dumbass so literally nobody follows me and then after a while steve calls me again sounding incredibly pissed off dude i got fucking robbed by some dickheads who go to our school he specified who it was im just not mentioning it because this is the internet i tell the group that he got robbed and that he sounded very pissed and they all dont believe me and start scouring more houses for candy eventually i get pissed right the fuck off that nobody wants to help my friends who got robbed and say you know what fuck this and start running in the direction that he wanted us to go to i get there and he asks where the group is and i tell him the truth nobody believed him thought i was lying started scouring the neighbourhood for candy and he gets even more pissed off that nobody believed him his friends get pissed off too that they had to fight people for their shit and nobody but me came to help my mates steve tyler and their friends never got any candy because they were meeting up and trying to not get robbed i gave them my candy and stuck with them eventually we told tyler and his friends to leave and enjoy halloween found the group tried to ask why the fuck they didnt believe us and their excuse was he said it in a way that didnt sound like it was true and then victimised themselves screamed at me and steve and we both left angry tommorrow will be an interesting school day,477,ESH

Halloween is my absolute favorite holiday and i had been making plans for MONTHS. I came up with so many halloween couple costume ideas for my girlfriend (F26) and i (M21) and had been continuously asking her about which ones she wanted to do. She didnt decide until the month of. With no time to order anything, we had to find/makeshift our costumes. We found everything for her perfectly but we struggled with mine and i ended up having to craft it. I hated how it turned out but decided i was still gonna wear it and have a good time.

She took a piece of my costume to wear for something else she had to do that wasnt any type of event on Friday.  She wanted to look cute. Understandable.

(Halloween party is Saturday and Halloween is Monday)

She liked this outfit so much she decided she was gonna wear it on halloween as a different costume and do our couples costumes for the party. This REALLY bothered me because not only have i been planning this for months and shes changing it but shes also taking a piece of my costume to do it. Also note i already hate my costume as is and she knows this.

look you get the gist of it, a lot of stuff happened that im not proud of and I wont sti through all of it,  well one day after finding out I was skipping class for her through the school  my mom forbid me from talking to Lily but honestly I didn’t care, then one Friday night I lied about where I was going and went out with her and some of her friends.

anyways we did something very stupid, I won’t say what, but Lily and I both got caught and ended pointing fingers at each other even though it was definitely both our faults but mostly hers.

I had to call my parents to get me out of potential legal trouble and so they did, Lily and I never talked after that as I blocked her on social media, she left the school both because of what happened and some things I had nothing to do with and I got out with the equivalent of a slap in the wrist.

about two months later she messaged me apologizing and saying she was wrong to try to pin everything on me, I replied that I forgive her but never told my parents that she messaged me because they 100% forbid me from talking to her and still they do this day, i’ve worked hard to earn back their trust.

I (28NB) love and am living with my bf (30M). For some context my bf loves to bake. I support him with it since he gets to do what he loves and I get to eat his yummy food. His favorite dish to make is a chocolate souffle which is great seeing as I love chocolate souffles. However, lately he's been calling me his perfect souffle and that I'm just perfect the way I am. We have just started trying for a baby and him calling me 'perfect' made me feel insecure as he had commitment issues in the past that he has been in therapy for 5 years for it. One day after going to the doctor and making sure everything is ok, I'm not feeling well and he comes in. He washes up then comes behind me and calls me perfect again. At this point I lost my temper and asked him if he didn't want us to be trying for a baby because my body will be different when I get pregnant? He went quiet and told me he was just trying to tell me that he appreciated me and my body before I got pregnant and insecure about my body. I felt really bad seeing as he was trying to do something sweet but went about it making me feel bad. I apologized and he accepted it but something still feels off. My sister told me I should upload her so Reddit, AITA?

So Reddit would I be the asshole if I let my friend know I saw her account, heres why I want to tell her.

1. The Facebook and Instagram images can be reserve searched so she should probably take that down.
2. Her only fans is very similar to her current name and that was one of the reasons I knew it was here
3. It might be weird talking/seeing her and just having secret.


We wouldn't be dicks about this, we just want to make sure she is okay because it doesn't seem characteristic of her and she's made a huge life change recently. If she is good with this that's fine. I just want to let her know about the reverse images and name, but I don't want to freak her out.

I have autism spectrum disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, so sometimes my reactions to changed plans/unexpected roadblocks are kinda big. It’s something I’m very much not proud of and I’m in therapy, on medication and on my path to healing.

This morning, something big happened that would’ve cost me my job if I hadn’t fixed it. Since I was still at home, I called my bf to see if he had any idea how it happened and any insight on how to fix it. I will admit that I was very anxious at this point, sort of word vomiting. At one point I said “I’m going to get fired” and I heard his boss in the background say “(bf’s name) you always say you’re going to get fired whenever you do something like this”
I quickly told him I had to go, I loved him, and hung up. I later texted him “I’d appreciate if you didn’t let your boss listen to emotional conversations. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I was going to be on speaker and it’s absolutely mortifying that your boss that.”

He responded back with something like “he gathered context from my end of the conversation.”

I told him that he’d repeated what I said and that it didn’t make much sense, and he told me it was fine if I continued to think he was lying even though he wouldn’t do that to me.

I trust him and I don’t think he was lying. I apologized and we made up, but now I feel pretty bad that I went and overreacted like that.

I recently turned 16, one of the milestones. Perhaps not as important as 18, but in my country it allows me to do quite a few things.

A few years ago, I got a road bike, worth x amount.
This year, a few weeks before my birthday, I got a new bike, worth y amount.

In this case, my new bike cost quite a bit less than my old one, but that's fine. I'm going to sell my old one, and even after selling it, should get more than y. This money will go to my parents, as expected. 

But here's what irritates me a bit. I was disappointed by my gifts. I didn't get that much physical stuff. I got money, and other stuff, but not that much stuff that I can see, interact with. And for by 16th, one might expect slightly more.
The way I see it, because my old bike (even being sold on) more than pays for my new one, I'd consider it a continuation of the initial gift, because I gain nothing (in fact, I technically lose value in my bike) With this logic, I feel let down that I have been given nothing good.

284,yimt13,AITA for not letting my family adopt a pet?,not letting my family adopt a pet,"2 years ago my dog died, she was very important to me and I broke down when it happened.
I'm currently 20yo and my 2 little sisters are 17 and 15
I still live with my parents and I plan to move in about 2 years.
Few months after my dog died, my sister brought up the idea of bringing a new dog to the family, I strongly disagreed because I didn't want to replace my dog but the real reason is that seeing other pets just make me ferious. I don't know how to explain it but I used to like pets and since then I really try to avoid them, but having them in my house (for example when my sister takes care of her friend's dog for few days when they are on vacation) makes me really furious and I hold myself from bursting out. Its reaching the point where I try to avoid coming back to my own house when I know there is a pet there.

Until now my mom respected my disagreement and didn't bring a dog no matter how much my sisters begged. But now my sister started feeding a stray cat that wandered to our garden, she named him and let him in the house a little. Even my big brother (22yo) started liking him which makes me even more mad since he had absolutely no affection to my dog unlike my 2 sisters who loved her.

Now everytime I see this cat I hiss him away and don't let him in the house when he tries to enter. My entire family yells at me to stop it but I just can't.
My sisters say they really want their own pet before they leave the house.
So am I the asshole for ruining every chance they have of it? I hate it when they say they want their own pet because my dog was theirs too and they loved her.

I don't remember the conversation since I have been trying to forget about it. Anyway, she said:

Mom: ""why am I getting mad at this game? It's dumb to get mad on things like this"" and other things that started to anger me more and more.

Me: ""That's why everyone is getting mad because of you.""

Mom: ""Oh, Really?"" With an annoying tone.

Me:""Yes, Me, Dad, my brother all the time""

She then started to compare me to my brother who did some stuff in the past too which were bad, but I rather not say what he did.

Then I remained silent. When I get frustrated I always end up crying, I can't control it at all. When she saw me crying:

Mom: Oooh? You are crying? She then started to make those sobbing noises which made me get angrier.

Me: It would've been better if women didn't have- and my dad stopped me from saying it.

I kept playing a little until she was saying something. I ignoring her so I couldn't hear what she said.

I went downstairs and vented a lot and decided to not to talk with her or help her at anything or even have an eye contact.

When she was telling me something, I didn't answer. When I said Good night once, I only said to my dad, she said good night and I answered ""I didn't say it to you"" and she answered ""What did you said?""

Now from the present day, I was still ignoring her. I was playing the same game again without getting mad (got better items). Both my mom and dad were getting ready to sleep and she said:

Mom: ""How much you have left there?""

Me: ""Stays silent""

Mom: ""You are staying up for too much (it is 11PM) and you have school tomorrow""

Me: ""Still says silent""

Mom: ""For acting tough, you will see that computer broken one day""

Me: ""Remains silent""

She then went to sleep, my dad has a problem at his toe and the nail is pushing his flesh or it's inside. Ingrown nail, I don't know exactly. Whatever, a few minutes passed until she said:

Mom: OP turn on the lights, hurry. Your dad's toe is inflamed. Look!

Because I heard this, I turned them on. Looked at his toe and see it. But it was a prank and she caught my hand while giggling she said:

Mom: ""Come on, let me hug you!""

I refused and she went silent. After I said:

Me: ""I expected you will say something other than this""

I expected her to say ""I am sorry because [...]"". I then kept playing and after I finished I turned off the computer. I heard her crying and I didn't cared about it, after leaving the room I said ""Good night, Dad"" and that's all the story.

Justin came into my life when my mom and dad had a messy divorce. My mom remarried a year after they divorced and married my stepdad, Brady and Brady has a son who is Justin.

Brady is a jerk because he always yells at me when my mom isn't around but when my mom was around he acted like the world's greatest dad. I wanted to be Justin's friend but Justin was cold towards me and he acted rudely. And when I was 17 I figured out the reason Justin hated me, Brady had told him lies about me. So after I moved out at 18, we haven't spoken to each other again.

Here's where the problem starts. One of my friends (17F) called Emily wanted to go to a party. I had a crush on Emily at the time and I wanted to go with her until I found out the host was Justin.  I decided to be polite and not be rude, so I found his phone number online and contacted him.

I called asking if I could get an invite and he said no and hung up immediately. I was fuming with rage because I wanted to confess my feelings at the party, so I decided to show up anyway with Emily and as I was professing my love for her.  Justin locked eyes with me and started yelling at me for being an ass and showing up uninvited.

I ended up ignoring him and continued to spend time with Emily but Justin ended up YELLING AT me and kicked me out. I left with Emily but Emily refused to go with me so I said ""WELL THEN YOU ARE NOT GETTING A RIDE HOME!!""

Emily and Justin aren't speaking to me,  and I regretted it deeply.

AITA?

UPDATE: I realize I am in the wrong. I apologized to both Emily and Justin, but Justin didn't forgive me. Whatever he is an ass anyways. Emily said that she did forgive me but she didn't have feelings for me at ALL. She said she never had feelings and strictly viewed me as a friend. I already had a date lined up for next week. I think it turned out well. Justin is such a fucking jerk. I don't know why I did all of this shit.

295,yij0un,AITA for wanting my stepdads brother to stop hanging around the house?,wanting my stepdads brother to stop hanging around the house,"My mom and I (19f) have been moving from house to house for about 5-6 years since she divorced my dad. About 4 years ago she met my now stepdad (Dave fake name) and about 2 years ago we moved in with him at his house. Dave has a brother (fake name will be John) that has been helping with projects around the house for the past 3-4 months. First it was remolding the master bath, then redoing the floors in some rooms. He fixed my leaky faucet which was amazing. It’s nice to have things fixed around the house. However this is where my mom and I start to have problems. John is still doing more projects. We thought he would be gone by now. He usually gets there at around 7-8 in the morning and stays until 5-6 working on things. So he does not stay over night, but my mom gets annoyed when he tries to insert himself into my mom and stepdads  relaxing time at the end of the day. Dave has no problems with John being there. It’s his house so he can have whoever he wants over. My mom just wants to have privacy which I agree with. I’m tired of having him sit around all the time (which he has started to do.) My mom is getting annoyed with him. We are thankful for all the help John has given us but I feel as though he needs to respect that my mom doesn’t want him over every day. It gets annoying when I wake up to drilling and hammering in the morning but by noon he just sits around and sometimes does some work. Dave gets mad anytime we say something about it. I’m not allowed to speak of it at all. My mom and I are just tired of having John over almost every day of the week. What was my final straw was a couple days ago, my mom has never had a night to herself in 2-3 years. She constantly takes care of Dave who has back problems. This was the night she was happy about. It was around 7 in the afternoon when my mom texted me that John came over and just started sitting around on his IPad doing things. I told her that she needed to tell him to get out. He has no business being there. He didn’t leave until an hour passed I think. I was pissed but I can’t do anything. It’s Dave’s house technically, but it’s like my mom doesn’t even live there to him, it’s like she has no say so in her own privacy. I feel like the a-hole because it’s his house and family, but does he not respect that my mom and I want privacy? 

So AITA for wanting my stepdad‘s brother to stop working on projects around the house and give us some privacy?

Edit: thank you to all who have replied so fast. I wanted to clarify some things. I do plan to move out soon I am trying to work to save money. My mom has expressed she doesn’t like him being around all the time. She has tried to tell Dave many times. John has helped with all the important things already, he is doing stuff like building things outside that we didn’t need now. He is at the house almost every day and most days he isn’t doing anything. My mom also pays for a least half of the bills and expenses is what she told me. She also buys all the groceries and does the cleaning.

304,yigntt,AITA for buying new shoes instead of new laces?,buying new shoes instead of new laces,"I (F22) have recently had my dog chew most of the way through the laces on my current set of shoes. The laces have a design that I can't find when looking for replacement shoelaces, and so I decided to get a new set of shoes for £15 (£13 not including the next day delivery fee). These ones don't have laces, so the dog can't chew through them.

My mum (F51), upon noticing that I'd thrown away the set of shoes with the chewed set of laces, retrieved them from the bin, threw them down in front of me (as in threw them down HARD, not dropped them), and began shouting at me that ""\[I\] have more money than sense at the moment"" and ""\[I\] don't want to help \[myself\]"". I admit to raising my voice at her while I was being shouted at.

For reference, the £15 is of my own money, and I am currently looking for a job.

he eventually took it off, but didnt like that i asked for him to, he lost his appetite while we were eating and hardly took a bite of his food. he responded saying he already feels he looks bad after work, so keeping it on sends the signal to other people that “oh, he just got off of work, thats why he looks like shit”. which i had trouble understanding. i can understand feeling like shit after work, but leaning into it while were at a date? in public? he then asked if i was embarrassed by him, which was hard to answer because he and his job do not embarrass me, he makes way more money than i do at the warehouse than i do bartending and being a receptionist. its really just the neon vest constantly making an appearance when were out together, but AITA for asking him to take it off?

All of this is a little pricey to me and i view as a huge luxury.

I went back and forth on this for an hour and finally convinced myself that i deserve this. Before i made the appointment i doubled checked with my mom to see if she can watch my son while i go which would be about 3 hours. She response was very unexpected. She reminded me there’s a possibility that her work could call her for over time(she works M-F for three hours a day) and she wasn’t gonna decline for me. Then she remembered she has that Thursday and Friday off giving her a for day weekend, but she looked at me real serious and started saying it was her day off and kept repeating that to me. She then said i need to be scheduling that kind of stuff for the weekend. The salon i was gonna book at has no weekend openings till mid December and i wanted it for my birthday. When i told her that she just looked at me and again said it was her day off and i need to schedule stuff like this for the weekend. She just treated me like i was being totally inconsiderate and like i do this often but i don’t especially not her but i did this time because she’s my only option.

314,yif4a5,AITA for telling my parent she doesn't care?,telling my parent she doesnt care,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing well

To give context, I've fallen behind on school. I've failed my highschool finals twice already and it appears I need to pay around 50 something to USD which is 1/12 of my parents monthly income where I live. The calculation is all approximate

I don't mean to victimize myself, I know I'm partially at fault too, probably. Or could have made better decisions. I've been feeling quite depressed ever since high school began and pandemic only contributed to my degradation of skills. My mom however barely understands me and usually just tells me I shouldn't give up etc. etc. while I really struggle to understand what matters to me

Therapy isn't an option nor available here otherwise I would take that route already 

Anyways, when I talked about the money to my mother, she got very angry with me. Told me she doesn't care about my exams and I'm not worth it anymore and that I'm on my own. That I'll be failing again so she doesn't want to bother. And in response I've told her she doesn't actually care about me and why did she even had a child in the first place. It mostly hit me because she told me she'd lend me money if I ever needed it to stand on my own feet before this

Our relationship was already in fluctuations and that didn't help. She keeps making snarky comments that just make me want her to not come home at all. Both parents go to work and often I'm the one at home doing chores, buying groceries, etc. 
Just *one day* I forgot to go for it and she got mad, made comments about how lazy and ignorant I am about everything

And later on she admitted: ""We've done it all for you all the time, only once I'm not going to step in and you're an ungrateful brat. Keep this on that account"" in regards to her snarky comment

I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen to me and how I can ever handle life.  I'll probably end up working if they don't pay for me. Although I'll try my best to not leech off of them as early as I can

I hear others who've gone to work since they were 15, save up or pay for themselves, or others who are progressing in their lives and kind to their parents even if they are passive aggressive. Some are my friends. I feel so useless compared to my peers

And I'm wondering what a thrid perspective thinks. Do I have a victim complex and it's my fault I'm lazy, or maybe it's not totally on me or on mom",hello everyone i hope youre doing well to give context ive fallen behind on school ive failed my highschool finals twice already and it appears i need to pay around something to usd which is of my parents monthly income where i live the calculation is all approximate i dont mean to victimize myself i know im partially at fault too probably or could have made better decisions ive been feeling quite depressed ever since high school began and pandemic only contributed to my degradation of skills my mom however barely understands me and usually just tells me i shouldnt give up etc etc while i really struggle to understand what matters to me therapy isnt an option nor available here otherwise i would take that route already anyways when i talked about the money to my mother she got very angry with me told me she doesnt care about my exams and im not worth it anymore and that im on my own that ill be failing again so she doesnt want to bother and in response ive told her she doesnt actually care about me and why did she even had a child in the first place it mostly hit me because she told me shed lend me money if i ever needed it to stand on my own feet before this our relationship was already in fluctuations and that didnt help she keeps making snarky comments that just make me want her to not come home at all both parents go to work and often im the one at home doing chores buying groceries etc just one day i forgot to go for it and she got mad made comments about how lazy and ignorant i am about everything and later on she admitted weve done it all for you all the time only once im not going to step in and youre an ungrateful brat keep this on that account in regards to her snarky comment i have absolutely no idea whats going to happen to me and how i can ever handle life ill probably end up working if they dont pay for me although ill try my best to not leech off of them as early as i can i hear others whove gone to work since they were save up or pay for themselves or others who are progressing in their lives and kind to their parents even if they are passive aggressive some are my friends i feel so useless compared to my peers and im wondering what a thrid perspective thinks do i have a victim complex and its my fault im lazy or maybe its not totally on me or on mom,452,YTA

Some background info to this story. We had plans to go together with our kids for trick or treating in her neighborhood because I live on a main road with no sidewalks and most surrounding areas have no sidewalks. I see that as not trick or treat friendly so I try to find a different neighborhood to go to. I asked my brother last year and this year had planned to go with this friend of mine. The week before Halloween, my daughter was sick and my friend's son got something too so we decided not to go together if we even went at all. I also know she's content with missing trick or treating bc her son is in daycare and got to go to parties...my child did not...nothing for Halloween..except looking forward to the actual day.

My daughter got better,  but I came down with strep throat. I went to doctor and got antibiotics and im not contagious but not up to par. 
I asked her if we could park our car in their driveway to go trick or treating. Im going to wear a mask and push a stroller..not going door to door and my husband and toddler were going to go door to door.
Now I didnt ask them to see us, go to their door for treats, nothing but park the car.
Her response was ""I am sorry but I am not comfortable with that."" My response was okay. Although I respect she has a right to answer how she feels, I dont understand what's uncomfortable? All I can think is shes thinking im not being responsible and just thinking along the lines of covid protocol...but as I stated before, im on antibiotics, not contagious, confirmed this with the doctor and also don't want to see or hangout with her and her family. 
Her response made me feel like I did some faux pas. I don't even want to ask because I feel like its so stupid to deny me of a simple request.

319,yie7l9,AITA for scrolling far back through my boyfriend’s messages when he allowed me to?,scrolling far back through my boyfriend’s messages when he allowed me to,"While my boyfriend of 3 years was replying to someone, I noticed he was replying to a name that I was unfamiliar with. I casually asked and he told me that it was the co-worker that he had been telling me that he made friends with at work. I knew about the coworker though I couldn’t remember him telling me what the name of this co-worker was or that if I even asked.  I jokingly pretended to be suspicious about their relationship and tried to test how he would react if ever I wanted to read their messages. He gladly gave me his phone and opened the messages for me to see. 


I felt relieved that he willingly did that so I was just trying to scroll up trying to load up all the messages though I didn’t really have the intention of reading them. I was only curious as to when they started chatting. The more I scrolled, the more I realized that they talked almost everyday, although mostly it’s work-related, I saw memes and banter going on here and there. I didn’t exactly read the messages as I scrolled up but I can see glimpses of what they talked about. I started to feel sad, because I realized on some days when we wouldn’t be talking, they would be and it would be a lot of talking. My insecurity flared up and I started telling him how they talk a lot and all. He then suddenly was mad all of a sudden and was accusing me of having no trust in him. I asked him when they started talking and he said he doesn’t remember. I thought after scrolling a lot that I couldn’t pinpoint when they did because there were just too many messages to load, so I just gave up and gave him his phone. Afterwards, he started acting cold and would not talk to me even when I offered for us to reconcile. AITA for what I did?


A little background as to why I acted the way I did:
Me and my boyfriend went through a rough patch a year ago because he admitted to me that he fell in love with his close female friend. Despite this, I forgave him because he came clean to me and he cut her off to save our relationship. He never cheated with her or anything, but it was more like a one-sided crush that turned into something worse on his part. Since then, we established boundaries, especially friendship with female friends on his part as to not blur the lines anymore in terms of friendship.


Also, another side note:
I never monitor messages in his phone in secret. This is an isolated case wherein I just casually asked out of the blue about this random message because I happen to see him reply while I was sitting next to him.",while my boyfriend of years was replying to someone i noticed he was replying to a name that i was unfamiliar with i casually asked and he told me that it was the coworker that he had been telling me that he made friends with at work i knew about the coworker though i couldn’t remember him telling me what the name of this coworker was or that if i even asked i jokingly pretended to be suspicious about their relationship and tried to test how he would react if ever i wanted to read their messages he gladly gave me his phone and opened the messages for me to see i felt relieved that he willingly did that so i was just trying to scroll up trying to load up all the messages though i didn’t really have the intention of reading them i was only curious as to when they started chatting the more i scrolled the more i realized that they talked almost everyday although mostly it’s workrelated i saw memes and banter going on here and there i didn’t exactly read the messages as i scrolled up but i can see glimpses of what they talked about i started to feel sad because i realized on some days when we wouldn’t be talking they would be and it would be a lot of talking my insecurity flared up and i started telling him how they talk a lot and all he then suddenly was mad all of a sudden and was accusing me of having no trust in him i asked him when they started talking and he said he doesn’t remember i thought after scrolling a lot that i couldn’t pinpoint when they did because there were just too many messages to load so i just gave up and gave him his phone afterwards he started acting cold and would not talk to me even when i offered for us to reconcile  for what i did a little background as to why i acted the way i did me and my boyfriend went through a rough patch a year ago because he admitted to me that he fell in love with his close female friend despite this i forgave him because he came clean to me and he cut her off to save our relationship he never cheated with her or anything but it was more like a onesided crush that turned into something worse on his part since then we established boundaries especially friendship with female friends on his part as to not blur the lines anymore in terms of friendship also another side note i never monitor messages in his phone in secret this is an isolated case wherein i just casually asked out of the blue about this random message because i happen to see him reply while i was sitting next to him,483,YTA
320,yi8pcg,AITA for yelling at my mom who slept with my friend?,yelling at my mom who slept with my friend,"So recently my mother (35-38F) was in my town. (She lives quite a bit away.) While she was in town, she apparently went to the local bar where my friend (30FTM) was. 

Now it’s important to note I used to work there so I basically know everyone there and my brother even works there currently. 

My friend, I’ll call them B, told my friend (19F, calling her E) that they had slept with my mother and didn’t know it was her until like the day after. 

After E told me, I was obviously upset so I called my mother. She answered and I just started yelling at her. I can admit that was not one of my better moments… but you find out your mother slept with one of your friends and you’d be pissed too. 

So, while on the phone with my mother, she told me that I “cant control what she does” and “I should get friends my own age.”

Note: i’ve been friends with people 3+ years older than me since i was like 13 😭. 

Another note: my mother is a lesbian and doesn’t know about B transitioning and has stated before she doesn’t want to be in a relationship with someone transitioning as it’s too much for her to handle both their mental health and her own. She’s not transphobic or homophobic I can tell you that. 

My friend E has told me I am not the asshole, however since talking to my mother about what she did I have barely talked to my mother. I told her she could pursue a relationship with MY friend or talk to me, but I would not be talking to her if she pursues a relationship with my friend. Texts here and there for doctor appointments. I also haven’t talked to my friend, B. AITA for this?

EDIT: feedback said i am TA, but i’d like to note my friend (B, 30) was bragging about it to the bartenders and the other staff. This person has a history of creating drama and making the attention go to them when it’s not on them.

Edit: i’m 16 F

326,yhg0t4,AITA for refusing to consider people who were not wearing costumes for a costume party?,refusing to consider people who were not wearing costumes for a costume party,"My organization on campus always hosts a huge Halloween party. I have been every year since I was a freshman and given that I am a senior this year it was my opportunity to help plan it.

I was asked to handle the costume contest. I was the head judge. The way it works is that all the other organizations choose one member of their group to submit for the best costume and we pick one male org and one female org member to win.

In past years, I have never particularly liked how the costumes were judged. The male costumes were always good, but the female costumes were just not great. They went with the typical girl Halloween costume. We always had some girls that show up in real costumes and not just string and a prop. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn’t be winning the costume contest.

So the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.

We looked at each contestant and we’re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.

This girl was in a Trixie Tang costume from
Fairly Odd Parents. The other judge was not a fan of it so she did not want her to win. But all the other girls weren’t in costumes. We debated it before I said that I would just say whoever she said was the winner to get her to shut her mouth. This was a lie and when I announced the winner, I explicitly said that Trixie Tang won because she has the best actual costume of all of the lady entries.

The other judge was mad and the girls from the losing groups were not happy. They said I judged unfairly. The president of my org co-signed my decision and said that the outcome was fine. We awarded the prize and everything was cool, but after that, none of the girls from the orgs that lost wouldn’t talk to me. The other judge told me I was a dick and lied to her which I guess is true, but our house our rules and our près. Was cool with it.

I asked her to send me his reports because I wanted to verify everything before I engaged with them. 

Turns out she was saying the truth, and he is actually sick. Now as a condition of seeing him before he passes and helping him out financially, I asked him to sell my childhood home to me at 1/10th of its current market price. 

 I got it cheap. I refused to dole out easy money. The house means a lot to me, It's the house my mom picked out and it's the home I hope to raise my family in once I have kids. He  agreed, albeit reluctantly, because he has no other option right now. 

The sale has gone through and the house is legally mine now. The money he got from the sale will help him get proper hospice care. 

I will be flying out to another country in a few weeks, but his wife is insisting I stay and help her out with some of his care.

 His wife is accusing me of cheating a dying man of his money and being a selfish prick. But has has already seen me. I visited him and helped him out financially by buying the house. I held up my end of the bargain.

AITA for refusing to engage with him any further?

Edit : a lot of people has asked me the reason for the estrangement. The reason is simple. He fucked my mom over. He contributed directly to her decline and eventual death. 

He and his wife agreed to my conditions. I didn't want to see him. But I did because he agreed to the sale. That was the deal. I drove to his (now my) home and met him and his wife. He wanted more from me emotionally and financially. I refused.

367,yickng,"AITA for yelling at my ""friend""?",yelling at my friend,"Hey reddit. I feel like I'm justified in this but based on a few arguments with friends I figured I'd post here.

Me and my friends all go to the same college, and we're all in a group chat together. We all have a kind of edgy sense of humor, and we end up toeing the line or making jokes at the expense of other people quite a bit. More often than not these are jokes that end up using ""slurs"" or other language that's deemed offensive today. For contexts sake I should mention that none of us are black or gay but we say N- or F- slurs pretty often.

One guy in the group has a history of telling us off for making jokes like these. One time last year one of the group members made a joke about his girlfriend that got him on his period or whatever and he left the group chat. We talked with him about it and his big issue was that he felt like we were bad people for cursing like that in the group chat. We told him we'd stop out of respect for him and we did, and he came back and joined the group. We've all been hanging out together since but I guess we fell back into the habit of making jokes like that again. The one guy continued to tell us to stop, and say that it was wrong for us to use language like that, but it felt kinda playful like he didn't really mean it so we brushed it off.

Well, I guess it was less playful because he reported us to the faculty of the school we go to. We all had to have meetings with somebody from the office of discipline. We felt really hurt and betrayed by our so called ""friend"". We basically got him in a room and asked him why he felt the need to report us and he tried to deny it, but then said that he wished he DID report us because the language we used and the jokes we made were ""sickening"". This is where I kind of lost my temper and started yelling. I told him that he was way out of line for reporting us to the office, that he was a snake for it. I have a scholarship and a job offer and he literally gambled it all over something as little as a few curse words or dark jokes- JOKES- about his girlfriend. He told me that he knew we weren't really joking and that we deserved what we got. We're still in college, we have our whole lives ahead of us. It isn't fair of him to risk my scholarship and my future career over a few mistakes we made when we were kids.

We haven't talked to him since. We're basically his only friends so nobody knows what he's been up to. I was complaining about the whole situation to a friend from high school when he said that I was an ass for yelling, that I should have just stayed calm about it. AITA?

372,yidpq0,AITA for bringing up the past with someone who's sick?,bringing up the past with someone whos sick,"Two years ago, I was at the end of a professional training programme and one of my appraisals went very badly (I was essentially held back due to a lack of progression - those good at math may be able to link this timing to a global health problem where disruption could have impacted on my training goals).

One of the appraisers made a very personal comment about me and my lack of progression to the others on the team - which was then repeated back to me (seemingly by mistake?). It was highly insulting and I was very concerned about the reputational damage that could be caused from such a comment - but I was a trainee and not in a position to challenge it. I don't think that the person who made the comment ever found out that I was told what she had said.

In the end, I managed to finish my training. I recently reached out to the person who made the comment and they were very happy to hear from me (I think they thought I wanted to catch up). But I asked them about what they said and what really did they mean by it. They immediately distanced themselves from the comment and talked about they had retired and were unwell, but that I was a good worker and that they hoped their response was satisfactory.

I responded that it wasn't. That the comment was given to me as part of formal feedback but that they had failed to address it in their email. I just got back an email saying that due to their health concerns and the fact that it's been two years, that they can't help me.

I'm not going to push further - I don't know what the health problems are but I do feel guilty for pushing this on someone unwell. I didn't know they were sick when I struck up the exchange, but I did know that they were retired.

So, AITA for not leaving well enough alone and bothering someone old and sick for something they said years ago.

I am a very sensitive person in general and I don’t deal with arguments very well. 

Today, I decided I have had enough of sharing this account and that they could make their own. I logged all devices out of the account and pretended I didn’t know how it happened, I logged back in and I posted some music on my status. “Wait, you got logged back in? Can you tell me the password I forgot.” “Sorry, I don’t feel comfortable with sharing the account anymore” “why?” “I don’t know,” then they lashed out at me. Telling me how selfish I am and how much time they spent on their playlist and that I should’ve told them sooner. I don’t agree with this. I told them I knew this would happen if I told them and they kept saying about how im selfish and how this hurt them. I blocked them. Im in a group chat with them so they texted me apologising, I flipped them off. I was not having this. If they wanted their playlist back they can search the account and use it.

I hired a babysitter for my 5 and 3 year old kids 2 weeks ago. My husband works shifts while I work long hours at a marketing company.


So far we've had no issues til yesterday. I came home at 6pm and noticed the babysitter's wet hair and new clothes. She told me she took a shower after one of the kids spilled milk on her. I was confused but visibly upset but she tried to ""reassure"" me the kids were fine, because my husband watched them while she took her shower which only lasted for few minutes. I was more confused that my husband was home when he had a shift to cover. I told her I didn't think it was appropriate of her to shower in my home like that. She argued that it was fine and that she had no choice and couldn't leave the milk on her like that. We argued and my husband heard the commotion and got involved. He said it was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be but I told the babysitter that I did not appreciate how she basically ignored how I felt about this and dismissed my feelings still. She went home, but we still argued on the phone. She thinks she's done nothing wrong and said I was being unfair when I mentioned potentially cutting from her salary after that.


My husband keeps saying that I'm overreacting and the ""poor girl"" couldn't handle having milk stains on her body and clothes. But I couldn't help feel it was inappropriate and she shouldve checked with me.



AITA for my reaction? Just for info. I'm the one who pays her, not my husband. I told her to call or text (always available) if anything happens. I didn't even know my husband was home at the time! If you noticed, I said that I argued with her even before she told me my husband was home. And no I didn't know how big the stain was but she argued about being covered in milk for 6+hrs. As for the question of why my husband didn't go to work? He said he was feeling a bit sick and swapped shifts with a coworker.

Mostly it was just paint that got rubbed off onto the car, but there's also 2 tiny cracks (like an inch long and hair thin) in the drivers side door panel and a small nick on the door handle (roughly circular and a few mm in diameter). It's a leased car, otherwise I doubt he'd care about such minor surface damage. Think I can get the paint off myself, but I'm at a loss with the cracks and the nick. I'm terrified that it'll be an added cost on the lease when we turn it in in a couple years. It was my fault, my dad was trying to help me pull in but I should have ejected and backed out again as soon as the mirror hit the garage door.

All the time I have known him he has struggled to sleep, typically as his health has kept him awake. However recently he has started to suggest it is because of me snoring - I’m not denying I may snore and that it may have been worse lately due to me having had a few colds over the last 6 months. However I don’t think I am to blame. 

In all the time I have known him sleep has been an issue and he has never spoken to a doctor about it and still refuses to now. 

Therefore I refuse to let him blame me for his sleep (or lack of lately)

A couple of years ago, a family friend of hers essentially kidnapped the cat and kept it in their house. Fast forward to now, the cat is no longer allowed in said family friends house and my girlfriends family won’t take it back in. My girlfriend and I thought about taking the cat to my place. I live in a very large bedroom that has its own washroom (The bedroom is the size of a large living room). I live with three other people and the other two have agreed to take in the cat. However, one of my roommates does not want the cat. He doesn’t like cats, doesn’t want it running around the house, and doesn’t want hair everywhere. I tried explaining to him that the cat would be in my room and it would be as if there was no cat in the house. He was initially upset about it, but later reluctantly agreed to taking in the cat for a week. If the cat was around the house too much, I would give it back.

396,yi0s1m,AITA for asking my boyfriend to let me know when he leaves our vacation rental?,asking my boyfriend to let me know when he leaves our vacation rental,"My boyfriend (39) and I (24F) were on a vacation to a mountaintop resort, because I have never seen the ‘leaf’ season and was excited to see everything on our two-night trip.

After arriving late af (3am) due to a number of factors, we stayed up until 5am. Even though I worked 7 hours and my boyfriend was off, I drove his new Tesla (a car I am less confident driving than my car) so I’m exhausted.

We decided at 5am to go to bed until around 7am, so that we could see the sunrise from the balcony, and then sleep in. We get in bed and he pulls out a book while I fall asleep. I am a deep sleeper while my boyfriend is not.

At 7am I am awoken to see the sunrise, it is gorgeous and while I am normally grumpy upon waking up, I thank my boyfriend for waking me before going back to bed.

At 9:30am I wake up alone, and call his name. Hearing no answer, I call out again. Call it anxiety or trust issues (he is still in the process of earning my trust back, not because of explicit cheating but because of old messaging with my coworker, and my ex left me with trust issues that I have {proudly} 80% overcome, set back by my boyfriend’s actions with others) my mind begins to panic.

I get out of bed, walk into the doorway of the living room and am hit by the volume of the vent fan (a noise he uses to sleep). I shout his name, before seeing him sit up from the couch in the living room. (He apparently never really went to sleep once I did at 5am, he woke me up at 7am and then did work stuff on his laptop until I woke up.)

He is instantly mad at me for yelling at him, and in my panicked, just-woke-up stupor (did I mention I CAN be an admitted bitch for 5-10 minutes after I wake up), I mirrored his anger and yelled that I was just worried about where he was. He, as a 39-year-old, private-schooled, only-child man, doesn’t like to be told what to do. So he countered with something along the lines of, “so what if I had gone to get coffee for us? Or breakfast? Would you be mad then?” 

Honestly, yes. Because

A. He left me in a condo complex while he took our only car, and

B. He would’ve driven down the mountain, with spectacular views that I had driven through the night before and couldn’t look at (I could tell by the sky and the lights of houses that the view was pretty damn nice but I was driving up a curvy mountain and it was 3am) without me, while he “let me sleep*”

*I am relatively easy to wake up, and I told him that all he could’ve woken me and told me he was leaving, and then if I chose to sleep I would do so in peace.

This started a fight. Him calling me possessive and controlling for not letting him go wherever he wants when he can’t sleep, and me saying that I don’t care when he takes drives at home, but we are on vacation together and I deserve to have the option of being included.

409,yhrgyu,AITA For Not Paying Rent when being denied basic comforts?,not paying rent when being denied basic comforts,"I have lived with my (ex) friend for 5 years now.  I was staying at the salvation army and she opened up her guest room to me for a few hundred a month.  This was supposed to be a month or so long arrangement but life got hectic.  This house has two bathrooms.  One is completely functional and modern.  The other one is not functional and needs remodeled.  I mean, the shower and toilet don't even work.  The sink works but no one ever uses it.  My former friend, I will call her FF, owns the house.  She has been saying for years she is trying to save the money to fix everything in that bathroom and it hasn't gotten done yet.  So last year I stopped paying rent except for when she hounds me about it and then I give her a little money to shut her up.  I'm sick of living in this house where I can't take a bath and have only a standup shower and don't have my own bathroom.

In the last 12 months she has gotten 3 tattoos and she went on a cross country road trip with her brother.  When I call her out on this stuff she just makes excuses like, ""It's gonna cost about 3 grand to do that bathroom.  I'm trying to save up the money but there are other bills and stuff that are just a higher priority.""  She has about $500 in the bathroom fund right now.  Yesterday she even had the audacity to blame me and say maybe if I paid rent she would have more money for the bathroom remodel.  She said I make more money than she does and it's ridiculous that she's supporting me.  She also sent some sappy text about how this is really hurting her a lot because 20 years of friendship are basically ruined and all she did was try to help me.  Whatever.

Well I think it's ridiculous that I can't even take a bubble bath while paying to live here but she can get tats and go on cross country trips.  Over the summer she told me she couldn't afford to turn the AC on either unless I start contributing more.  She said the AC raises the electric bill by $50 a month and she needs me to help if I want it on.   I'm sick of being denied basic comforts while she can get tats and go on trips. Oh and as of today (Halloween) she is posting all over social media about going to work at some big tattoo convention in 2023 and possibly going to Germany with her SO who is from there.  SMH...  Just wow.  

So am I the asshole?   If anyone is wondering I am 40 and she is 43.

420,yguunb,AITA for giving my husband the green light to accept his mom's lavish gifts when she gives our children shitty ones?,giving my husband the green light to accept his moms lavish gifts when she gives our children shitty ones,"My MIL is a very difficult woman. She has struggled a lot with the transition of her kids having kids, as she only views her family as her husband and kids, and does not like ""having a grandmother role forced on her"" When my oldest was born I was naive and thought MIL would help out. I learned that the hard way. She didn't want to do family holidays and just wanted to be alone with her husband, stopped doing family vacations. Honestly I thought it was just because she doesn't like me, but she loves her son in law and isn't any more interested in their children.

I will admit this hurt me and I set pretty harsh boundaries. One of the boundaries was that my husband could not accept gifts from MIL. She would always get him really nice birthday and Christmas gifts and get our kids cheap impersonal junk. MIL's gifts to him were always experiences or hobby related things as he grew up wealthy but does not make the kind of money he grew up with, and she feels he doesn't treat himself enough. Six years ago we told MIL that he would no longer be accepting these gifts as he is a husband and father first, and it isn't right.

Well my husband has been struggling with some depression lately. One of his biggest things is he feels like he is just a husband and father and lost his identity. He feels he gives constantly and gets very little back. I hate seeing him like this, so I called MIL and asked if she wanted to resume giving him gifts and said I would no longer stand in the way.

Well he had a birthday recently and MIL bought him something for his hobby (probably a $10,000-12,000 bike according to the internet) and gave him some gift cards so he could take a weekend away to his favorite trails. I could see how much it meant to him and felt I made the right decision, but my daughter blew up.

She said I was being unfair to her by allowing MIL to flaunt how selfish she is, and that he should stand strong and say there will be no gifts until she can buy gifts for the family. She said she was disappointed in my lack of a backbone and disappointed in her dad. I saw my husband's face fall and told him it was ok and I didn't regret my choice, but our daughter was cold the rest of the night.

Normally my mom throws people big parties on their birthday. She's done it for everyone in the family including my older sister, dad, and herself, except for me. We had a small family dinner that she decided for my birthday. Leading up to my birthday I gave my parents a list of things I would like if they were going to get me a gift.

430,yi04j8,AITA for telling my brother to not apologize?,telling my brother to not apologize,"I (21nb) lived with my brother (23m) and his ex-girlfriend (21f) for a little less than a year now. I moved in with them under the agreement that I would help pay the mortgage for my brother's new condo. He and I had arranged this before things got serious between them. While this condo had his name and only his name on the deed, he had every intention of sharing it with his ex. 

To say the breakup was ugly is putting it lightly. She ended up saying and doing some really nasty things to both me and him, and took everything from their room and the communal spaces, including most of his things as well as mine. He isn't innocent either, he did some pretty messed up stuff, but not to the extent of what she did. My brother is absolutely heartbroken, understandably, and is starting to despise this place. Like I said, while her name wasn't on the deed, this was her home as much as it was his. 

To go along with everything that has happened my health has been on the decline, making me strapped for cash trying to figure out the problem. Recently my brother decided that he is going to move out and raise the rent of this place so it'll pay for his new place (he will be renting with a couple of his buddies). I can't afford it, and I tried to negotiate something that would fit both of our needs. He said that wouldn't happen and told me he would be moving out at the end of the year. I don't have any place to go besides my parents, and while I love them dearly, my mom and I do not get along and he knows that. 

This is the part where I may be the AH. The other night I was having a panic attack from all of the stress that has been weighing on me when my brother walked by on his way to work. He asked me what was wrong. When I tried explaining to him that while I understood why he was moving out and raising rent and all that, it puts me in a terrible position and he knows that I wouldn't be able to find my own place even with the help of friends because of the amount of medical debt that is piling at my feet. All he said was ""I'm sorry"", and something in me broke.  I told him to not apologize because he knew of this already, and yet chose to follow through on his plan, and that the only reason he was apologizing was because I was upset. He left without saying anything else.

This morning I got a call from my mom demanding why I would say ""such awful things to my brother"" and demanding that I apologize to him because he's going through it right now. I tried to explain my side and she wouldn't hear it, and just kept repeating that I'm an asshole and I need to apologize.

Carmen and Michael are both lower middle class. Carmen is a single mom of 2 and works as a nurse. Michael and his wife are teachers and are expecting their first child. Carmen makes $100k Michael and his wife make a little over $100k combined and we live in California near the Bay Area, where 100k is considered low income.

Elisa is a nanny for an extremely rich family. I don't know if she's considered live in because she lives in a separate house but on the same property. She makes $250k per year plus bonuses, doesn't pay for rent or utilities, rarely buys groceries because she always eats with the family, they bought her a brand new car, they pay for her gas, maintenance, all of her medical, dental, vision, etc. is 100% paid for by the family. Hell, they even pay for her gym membership and her vacations. She's worked for them for 2 years now and recently bought a rental building in cash. Needless to say, she's doing very well for herself.

Michael and Andrew just asked me for money. Michael needs $30k for part of a down payment for a townhouse and Andrew wants $10k so he could graduate with no debt. I told them to ask Elisa for money, not me, and that she could easily afford to help them out.

Elisa called me the other day asking what I said to her brothers because now they're both asking her for money. I told her what I told them and she yelled at me for ""volunteering"" her to help with her brothers' expenses. I told her that I never said she would help them, I just said that she easily could. She said she doesn't feel comfortable loaning money to family because she doesn't want to risk their relationship if they don't pay her back. I told her it shouldn't be a big deal if they don't pay her back because we know her Christmas bonus will be close to double what her brothers want, plus if she says no she could potentially risk her relationship with her brothers because she can afford it.

It wasn't an easy choice, and despite living here we have completely separate finances. MIL made it clear she would not be paying for anything for us, cooking for us, and didn't want us in her space. That is fine. We have been buying all of our own food and avoiding her as much as possible.

MIL recently started bringing her new boyfriend ""Ken"" around. At first he was very nice and seemed surprised at how we lived. We seemed to want to fix MILs relationship with my husband, and offered to buy more food so we could eat, and invited us out a couple times.

I really liked Ken at first, but then he changed overnight. MIL mentioned something about the time she was alone on Christmas, and he asked why she was alone on Christmas. MIL explained it was right after FIL left and it was our Christmas to be with my parents. She also said she was depressed because her birthday is the week and she had just turned 40, and he looked at us in disgust and asked why wouldn't we change plans based on the circumstances.

Before we could even explain he called my husband a piece of shit and said clearly I control him and he isn't man enough to do anything about it. Since then Ken has been really mean. He won't talk to us, rolls his eyes if we talk at all. He's been spending a lot more time here lately and bringing his dog which we are not allowed to pet. He told his teenage daughter to stay away from me as i am trash, and he told MIL she was right and he was sorry for interfering, and she should stop letting us have food.

The final straw was over the weekend a client of his gave him some tickets for a local event with some VIP access. He invited MIL, his daughter, and his daughter's boyfriend, and gave someone who works for him two of the tickets. He still had two left over, so he took them outside and lit them on fire.

Now I know we aren't entitled to the tickets, but to me that was so cruel, petty, ridiculous. I went outside and told him I am not responsible for his girlfriend's train wreck life, her divorce, or the fact she was alone, and he is acting like a loser. Why is a grown man even this upset over Christmas. I told him he probably still believes in Santa and he needs to grow the hell up and stop acting like a white knight bully.

MIL is now not speaking to me and is refusing to speak to any family who speaks to me, and called me trashy and disrespectful and said I need to shut up while living in her house.

I have one son(11) he has one son is is about to turn 8 in a few days. Bf only sees his son every other weekend. 

A month ago, I made the suggestion of going to an animal farm for the son’s birthday. The son is all about it and that’s what he wants to do. A small birthday celebration with presents and cake etc. All good right. 

After being on implant birth control for 7.5 years, my bf and I decided it was time to give my body a break with the hormones. I got my implant removed early. 6 weeks later he got a vasectomy. I got pregnant. We found out when I was 12 weeks pregnant. 

It’s been 8 days exactly that I haven’t had my baby. Even though it wasn’t what we planned for, my heart changed and I was happy. 
Now I’m broken and I’m honestly a big mess. I have panic attacks every time I go anywhere and see anything baby related/ pregnant ladies/ gender reveals/ etc. I have two appointments with psychiatrists but haven’t seen them yet bc I’m a new patient. 

My bf is putting all his attention into his son. Maybe that’s his way of grieving, idk. But it makes me feel like our child together didn’t matter. 

He’s upset with me for not wanting to celebrate his son’s birthday anymore. It would be hard for me celebrating the birth of his child while I’m still struggling.

We were in a friend group and almost everyone would basically obsess and worship over her it wasn’t healthy, almost all of them ended up dating her and they were all super toxic to me and her which ruined both our mental health in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL and sent us both spiraling downhill.

Years later she lives in Kentucky and we don’t speak to any of the people in that friend group except for each other but in the past years she’s been going down a hill of despair. She would date basically everyone, vape, she’s even do inappropriate stuff with her lover in public. (I was not around but her friends were talking about it.)

Some time ago when she had just moved back to Kentucky she introduced me to her best friend online and we all became the best of friends. But once my friend went into their downhill despair pit their devices would constantly be taken away so we couldn’t contact or do anything for months but her friend in Kentucky wouldn’t get her stuff taken away and at the time I didn’t really have friends so I would talk to her. My friend and my friends friend had known each other and been besties since they were like 5 but recently they stopped being friends because my friend was being an a-hole. They wouldn’t listen to her closet friend who has it just as rough as her but she wouldn’t listen. They had been cutting and their friend just wanted to help as they’d cut before but instead they yelled at them and stopped being friends. I know they have terrible mental health but I still can’t see what they did was right or just as they have not made an attempt to fix it after months. I am still friends with the girl who I’ve been talking about but we don’t talk much as she has become weird and obsessive about her boyfriends.

I (M18) have spent the past three ish years living with my dad's ex (lets call her Jane) (she's not my mom, her and my dad were together way before I was born) because I was pretty sick ahd her family's incredibly rich and has like a million doctors so they could give me better access to better treatment. The original plan was that I would just go with her family and my dad would join me afterwards once he got work stuff sorted, but the pandemic  got in the way and made it harder for my dad to join me afterwards since I am immunocompromised and he wasn't in a position to be isolated with me. I'd rather not go too much into the specifics of it all but what you need to know is that I hadn't seen my dad in person for over a year before this week.

During the period of time that I was gone, my dad took in a different kid (M16) since he's registered as a foster parent. Since then, he's adopted the kid. And I had a lot of differing emotions over it when I first found out, and also a lot of time to sit with them. I've spoken to him over the phone a couple of times, but never in person.  

Anyways, I got the news that I would finally be able to go home a little while ago, and decided that I would surprise my dad (and new brother) with it. It's not entirely a surprise in the sense that my dad was aware I've been getting better and would be getting home sometime late October/early November, it's just a surprise in the sense that he wouldn't know the exact moment I'd get home. So, Jane agreed to help me arrange it and all, and I ended up deciding I'd prank my brother when I got there. Nothing too bad, just make him think the house is a little haunted before revealing myself. He'd mentioned that the house *felt* like it should have a ghost or two, so I found it fitting. 

I did just that yesterday, and it was pretty fun. I got to finally meet my brother and actually prank him in the process, which I thought was normal brother stuff? IDK, never had a brother before. But IDK, I suppose he was more spooked than intended cause my dad's reaction upon seeing me was just to scold me for ""trying to run off"" the kid. Not my intention at all, but yeah, was told it just made it seem like I wanted him gone. 

And, listen, okay, maybe a prank wasn't the best first impression, but I really don't think it's a big enough deal that I don't even get a welcome here, you know?

484,yggnja,AITA for taking my daughters “emotional support” dog back to the shelter?,taking my daughters “emotional support” dog back to the shelter,"My daughter is 17. I’m 47. My wife is 44. My daughter had been having problems with her anxiety and depression, school had been very hard for her and she asked us if she could get an animal for “emotional support”. I asked her why we couldn’t just put her in regular therapy again but she said she didn’t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn’t want to try it again.

I was pretty against bringing an animal into the home as my daughter can barely keep her room clean and remember to wash her dishes, much less take care of an animal. And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog because I work long hours and didn’t want to be picking up messes when I got home. My wife said I was being unfair and that this could be what my daughter needed to get back in good spirits.

So we got her a dog. We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care (such as frequent grooming and other traits) and I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference. 

The dog was great at first and it got along with my daughter and wife greatly. Me not so much, but it could probably sense I didn’t really like it either. But then it started getting out of its leash on walks, tearing up the couch and various other toys we bought it. My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I’d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet. 

I warned her twice that if she didn’t start taking responsibility that the dog would be going back and she gave me excuses saying she was feeling depressed again. She said she would do better, but didn’t. Ultimately, I got fed up so one day when she went to school I loaded the dog in my truck and told the shelter he wasn’t a good fit for us.

Obviously when she came home she was upset. She was saying the dog was her best friend but I told her that she wasn’t taking very good care of him, and he didn’t deserve that. Wife says it was very harsh to just take the dog back while she was gone, but she agrees daughter wasn’t responsible. My daughter has been saying I brought back her severe depression and we haven’t been talking.

After some deliberation I decided that spending time with Jason was more important than going to a country concert that I didn’t even really want to go to in the first place. 
Rebecca decided to go to the concert without me which was all fine until I found out she took her mom with her using my ticket that I paid over $400 for (she bought the tickets so they were all in her name but I sent her money to pay for my ticket) 
After the concert was over I messaged Rebecca to say that there was no rush on paying me back for the ticket but that the total amount was $400 (I had also already paid for the hotel but I let her off on that). 
She then told me that I forfeited the right to the ticket when I left her hanging and that she had to bring her mom so she didn’t have to miss the concert. 
I had tried to sell the ticket a week or two before the event but wasn’t able to. I told her that if no one bought it I’d take the hit. But her mom used the ticket so I told her that her mom should have to pay for the ticket. 
Rebecca disagreed because I said I was ok taking the loss if I couldn’t get anyone to buy the ticket.

488,yhhiv0,AITA for telling my roommate she can't host so many movie nights in our room?,telling my roommate she cant host so many movie nights in our room,"Hello, I need advice on if I'm actually in the wrong or not. I (18F) live with my roommate we'll call her Alice (18F), in college. Alice is aro-ace, this will be important. She has a projector and likes to host movie nights in our room when I'm not there. 

Recently I had two shitty nights and every time I've come back there's been 5+ people in my room past 11 pm. Yesterday after they cleared out I asked my roommate to not host so many especially when she is aware I'll be coming back. She said okay and went to join her friends in the hall.

My boyfriend(18M)stayed in my room late that night to comfort me. When my roommate came back she saw us and said ""I don't understand how you asked me to not host so many movie nights when you didn't even ask me if he could stay the night"" to which me and him said he wasn't and we were waiting for her to get back so he could leave.

After he left she said she wanted to talk. She told me, whenever me and him cuddle, dance while we talk (a weird thing we do), or just show PDA to each other it makes her uncomfortable. She said she's not sure if it's due to her being aro-ace. Also saying that she doesn't want him over as often, he's normally over 5-6 times a week. While she either has her friends in our room for similar amounts of time (alittle less) or stands with our door open talking to them, whenever I'm trying to sleep. Also claiming that because they aren't friends it feels like he's a stranger in her room. And that she hoped they would become friends yet she said every time he's here, he's here for me. Which I thought was normal and that they shouldn't be like friends but more acquaintances.

I felt like she kinda attacked me after I brought up movie nights. Like she wanted to get back at me. Though she said she's felt like this previously. I had asked in the past if he made her uncomfortable and she said no. So I'm confused about how to fix her issue or if I should just keep living the way I have been? Or if I'm even in the wrong here. So AITA?

495,yhnqur,AITA for revealing my SIL secret to my parents?,revealing my sil secret to my parents,"Context: We are an Irani Family living in Germany, I (26f) moved back to my parents house to support my father(65) with his health and my brother (31m) proposed to his GF(29f) of 5 months in January. It was a shock for everyone but we all supported him.

Their wedding is at the end of November and everyone is doing their best to help. 

&#x200B;

My brother invited Vi and her family. Vi just turned 20 while her parents are the same age as my parents. When her parents came to Germany my family helped them a lot and in return Vi’s parents babysat me and my brother a lot. Her parents are our second parents, my bro even calls Vi’s dad regularly and they talk. 

&#x200B;

Now this is important, Vi and her family are doing a lot for the wedding. Her parents help with decorations and ceremony planning and Vi designed the invitation card AND drew small chibi sketches of EVERY PERSON ATTENDING! All for fucking free. Yeah. Free.  
All they ask for return is a nice seat at the wedding and their gas prices to be paid. They drive 2 hours to get here and 2 hours to go back EVERY SUNDAY SINCE JANUARY! Both my brother and SIL did try to give them money for their work but they decline it, my brother cried happiness when he saw the decoration and so did SIL.

&#x200B;

I never really had time to bond with SIL alone and last Monday I did, we went for some coffee. The first 30 minutes it was nice and we had fun. Vi called me to chat but I told her I was busy and will call back later. When I hung up, I realized how weird SIL looked and I asked what was wrong. She told me the last month she grew „disgusted“ with Vi and her parents. I asked why and she said the age gap is huge between them and that they ask for a lot when they come over. Angry was an understatement. Her mother had 6 miscarriages until Vi came, and they only ask for the gas price and breakfast. Persian breakfast is literally just bread, cucumber and cheese. I was furious and called her out on this and she cried begging me to keep this secret between „two sisters“.

&#x200B;

I was too angry, I stormed off and told Mom. On my way I also called Vi and her mother picked up and I told her everything. Her mother thanked me and hung up. 

My parents are furious at Vi and refuse to help or attend the wedding UNTIL SIL apologizes to Vi and her parents. Vi called me and she was mad, saying that SIL was already being a „bridezilla“ in private and now she also made her mom cry. I saw some screenshots and apparently Vi had drawn over 300 sketches until SIL was ""okay"" with them. Though SIL blames it on her OCD (idk if she has it or not)

&#x200B;

My brother is keeping himself distant because he agrees SIL messed up but „he has to respect his wife“ bs. SIL and her family have been blowing up my phone about how I am a snitch and a jealous „bitch“. I am angry at what my SIL said but I also think I ruined her marriage?

496,ygv29z,AITA for forcing my MIL to babysit?,forcing my mil to babysit,"Throwaway.  

Ever since me (27F) and my husband Mark (30F) had our kids, my MIL had been begging to have them over every day. We live two hours away from her house, but we make sure to visit her on weekends as the kids love spending time at her place and playing with their cousins who live nearby too. 

However whenever they’re at her house she never does anything for them. She doesn’t make them food, doesn’t look after them, and is generally just happy holding them or playing with them for a bit. Of course this is okay with us, and we are more than happy fixing them a quick snack or making sure they’re well. But lately she’s been calling me and Mark nonstop begging us to drop the kids at her place overnight. She says she misses spending ‘real’ quality time with them, and keeps saying I refuse to let her see them more than once a week. We tried to explain that with us being two hours away and the kids being a handful (they’re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her. She still insisted but we ended up saying no. She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn’t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only. 

Into the issue. After saying goodbye to the kids Mark took me to a fancy restaurant halfway across town. He said that since the kids will be at their grandma’s place we can finally have quality time. I agreed and half an hour into our evening we got a call from MIL. I was afraid at first but she said nothing happened, she just asked when will we back. I replied that we will pick up the kids at 9 am the next day, and she immediately got upset. She said she couldn’t handle the kids and they kept demanding food, that she play with them, or straight up saying they want their cousins over. We tried telling her we are busy and at best will come over in a few hours, but she refused. She said she, and those are her exact words, “had her fill with the children and never expected such trouble”. I told her that was normal behaviour for kids their age and she started yelling at me on the phone. Mark ended up taking the phone and told her we will be over at 9 the next morning. Then he ended the call and we ended up going back to our date. 

Next morning we showed up at 9 exactly. Our kids were happy to see us but my MIL refused to speak to either of us. When Mark tried joking with her she screamed at him that we trapped her with our kids and that we were irresponsible and cruel. I reminded her she was the one who kept insisting we do this and she said she changed her mind and we could’ve taken the kids with us and gone home. She’s now telling family that we dropped the kids off at her house and refused to come pick them up and that I was super rude. I’ve gotten several messages saying I should be a better DIL. AITA?

514,yhkx30,AITA For not wanting my cat to be called ‘SuperDog’?,not wanting my cat to be called ‘superdog’,"A lighthearted and really low stakes post, but we said we’d throw it out to Reddit to decide:

My partner (35M) and I (33F) have been picked as the adopters of two cats pending final checks (YAY!) but we are having a disagreement about names as he wants to make one of them ‘SuperDog’ (we have agreed on the other name).

His opinion: it’s objectively hilarious (he literally laughs every time he thinks about it, and to be fair, it is funny and it comes from an in-joke of ours).

My opinion: I’m not going outside and shouting ‘SUPERDOG!!’ when it’s time for their food, I don’t want that shouting at the vets, and if god forbid she go missing I don’t want to put that on posters!!! 

Does anyone have a pet with a ’weird’ name? How do you feel about it? Should I just give in and let him call her SuperDog? Do I give her another name and just let him call her that? 

Just for reference my preferred name is ‘French Fry’ which I know is also not ‘normal’ but it comes from an episode of Malcolm In The Middle where Dewey is naming tigers. I’m more than willing to scrap both and choose a third name. 

EDIT: We’re not in the US, in our country it’s perfectly normal for cats to go out.

517,yhp8hc,WIBTA for asking my friend (21f) and her roommate/friends to not smoke weed while I'm (20f) at her apt?,wibta for asking my friend f and her roommatefriends to not smoke weed while im f at her apt,"My friend Carly (21f) and I (20f) have been friends for \~8yrs and we go to different colleges in the same city. She lives abt 30min away and it's not easy to hang out often in person. Bc of this, I had no idea she'd started smoking weed regularly til she mentioned it this summer.

Last night, I was invited over to watch a movie. I agreed. I assumed we would be going out to see it in the theater, but it wasn't until we were almost at her apt that I was told we were watching a movie at her apt instead. And also that her roommate and his friend would be there too. When I got to her apt (which is small and has only one window), I was hit with the strong smell of weed. I didn't mention it bc it's none of my business and people smoke all the time in the city. I also figured she was noseblind to it and felt it would be rude/embarrassing to bring it up since there wasn't much she could do.

During the movie, her roommate and his friend each took a hit from a homemade gravity bong they'd recently made. They didn't go out onto the fire escape and the smell was strong. This was the first time I met them and no one else was bothered, so I didn't feel like I could complain. It'd been abt 2.5hrs and had a pounding headache. Carly excitedly showed me the bong and wanted me to get close to watch, but I said the smell was giving me a headache, hoping she'd get the hint. She nodded but didn't seem to fully get it. She sat inside to hit it on the windowsill, but bc of how the bong was made, a lot of smoke leaked into the apt and I had to go sit down, dizzy and overwhelmed. This was the first time I'd been exposed to the smoke for a long time and found out it made me feel like shit.

The bong was hit 3 more times when I was there and for the rest of the night, I felt awful. I had a headache, stomachache, and even though I showered when I got home, it felt like the smell was stuck in my nose, which was nauseating. This morning was the same, plus my heart was pounding, my brain felt really slow, and I was extra anxious for no reason.

I want to be able to prevent this in the future and keep hanging out with Carly. I'm worried that by asking her not to smoke when I'm there, it'll sound like I'm judging her for smoking at all, since I don't smoke or drink (a personal choice, that makes me the ""token straight-edge"" according to her friends).

526,yhgggg,AITA for not Photoshopping my Stillborn Aunt into a Family Photo?,not photoshopping my stillborn aunt into a family photo,"There's a little known fact in my family (at least among the cousins and grandkids), that one of my aunts, Aunt Ann, was supposed to be a twin, but her twin sister was stillborn. It's not exactly a taboo topic or anything, just some random trivia that never has any reason to come up in conversation.

One day, I was visiting my Grandma, and showing her how I was using Photoshop for one of my school projects. She seemed really interested, got quiet for moment, and then got up and pulled a small diary out of her closet. She started talking, and to my surprise, I learned that she had named her lost baby, Sophia Rose. Every year she would write a birthday message in the diary, just to remember her. She had never told anybody all these years, because back then, that sort of thing just wasn't talked about. But now she wondered if there were any way I could photoshop another picture of Aunt Ann into her favorite family picture, so it looked like her twin was there. She had always wondered what it would've looked like with her family completed.

I, of course, was quite willing to do it. My Aunt Ann was having lunch with my mother and I a few days later, and I thought I'd run the idea by her then and ask her if she had a nice picture I could use.

But, to my surprise, both my mom and Aunt Ann were horrified with the idea. Aunt Ann especially said she didn't want it done, that using her picture for a dead person was morbid and creeped her out. It would be her face representing a ghost. Plus, apparently they weren't even identical twins, just fraternal, so they wouldn't have actually looked alike. She very clearly didn't feel comfortable with it.

I figured I probably shouldn't do it since Aunt Ann had quite clearly said no. When I told her, Grandma didn't seem upset or disappointed, she just said that she understood, and thanked me for looking into it. I told her if she ever wanted to talk to me about Sophia or make something else in memorial, I'd do it, but she said that it was fine, and it was so long ago it didn't really matter. She never brought it up again.

I thought that was the end of it, but years later now, I was chatting with one of my much younger cousins (not Aunt Ann's kid). Apparently she had never heard about Aunt Ann's twin, and grew quite upset with me when I told the story of the Photoshop request. She said that was a really heartless thing to do, to deny our grieving grandma's one chance to see what could've been. It could've given her some closure. She said I should've just done the picture anyways and just not told Aunt Ann about it. She would've never known.

Now I'm feeling guilty.  Even if it wasn't Sophia Rose, Grandma still could've pretended for just a moment that her lost daughter was there. It wouldn't have been hard to do it in secret, and I could've at least given her that. On the other hand, it feels really crummy to go behind my Aunt's back like that when she drew such a clear boundary.

This weekend, a group of university friends organized a weekend trip staying at a small cottage near the sea.

Due to a difficult financial situation: incredibly high inflation, increased rent and a astonishingly high utilities bill, I decided to only stay for one night so I could join them but still be economically responsible.

In hindsight, I should have let the whole group (20+ people) know that my decision to join one night was financially motivated but I’m not close with some people since I haven’t seen some of them in a few years. Furthermore, I didn’t anticipate what would happen.

It was decided that the whole bill (accommodation and groceries) would be split over everyone even though half the group stayed one night like me and the rest were there the whole weekend.

When I made my discomfort know about this decision know, I was told: “you chose to stay one night so you have to pay everything.” And to not be “difficult because it is too hard to calculate the bill.” I actually broke down crying as I have been incredibly stressed out by my financial situation. But I was I was told to just “suck it up.”

*EDIT: I see see some responses saying I backed out at the last minute, however, before booking the house everyone including me made it known how long we were staying. Since equal amount of people either stayed Friday or Saturday night, there was no “empty” beds so to speak. 

Furthermore , the decision about how to split the costs was decided after the trip hence my surprise/distress about it. I assumed that the dinner groceries and bar drinks on the night before I arrived would be split over the people who were actually there. Just doesn’t seem to be fair to pay for food & drinks that I didn’t partake in.

539,yhhkue,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend’s mum at our wedding?,not wanting my boyfriend’s mum at our wedding,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriends mum at our wedding?

My boyfriend and I had a rough start of our relationship. We met online, he moved to my country and left his family, apartment and job behind. He did everything to make our relationship work out. No matter how thankful I am for that, there always have been a few arguments about stuff that concerned me (ex girlfriend still in his life, texting edgy stuff to other girls etc.). Making him move in here, finding a job, car and proper life standards was not easy too. We were both stressed (I had many important exams at that time and was dealing with mental problems). 
One day we had a really big argument, I don’t want to go too much into the details. I basically found some explicit stuff from other girls on his phone and some spicy chats. I confronted him and he couldn’t explain it much to me. At this time I felt really broken and hopeless, it took me a few days to come to the conclusion of wanting to break up with him. As we talked about it, things got out of control again and I ended up staying at my parents place for a while. 
He must’ve texted his mother about our argument and that I wanted to break up with him, I don’t know what exactly they chatted about, but his mum ended up texting me on facebook, threatening me and insulting me in the worst way (I can’t write that out on reddit the post would be banned). She was basically threatening me to end my life and called me out as a b…ch. 
This was a while ago, and my boyfriend and I are fine now, but his mother never apologized to me though. We just ignore any topic that’s about her. 
Half a year ago my boyfriend proposed to me, I said yes. We are planning our wedding now and we don’t want a big wedding, only close friends and family. Here is the problem: I don’t feel comfortable to have his mother around on our big day, if she wouldn’t apologize to me.
So far when we tried to reach out to her, nothing good came along, and obviously far away from an apology.  He is arguing to me that he wants his mum around, he loves her no matter what. He also says, that me expecting her to apologize is too much to ask for. I am completely frustrated and I want my boyfriend to be happy too, that requires to forgive his mum for what she did and just invite her without feeling good about it. 
I don’t know what to do.

553,yhb07j,AITA for giving a kitten to a friend that then infected her cat with a flu?,giving a kitten to a friend that then infected her cat with a flu,"So I recently came into 3 kittens that were all pretty healthy and about 3 months old. I took them to the vet and the vet told me they were all fine but with a little flu. Vet said it would be no big deal and that they would be okay to be adopted after being dewormed/deflead.

From here, my friend, lets call her Jenny, decided that she wanted a new kitten as a buddy for her cat. I assumed that her cat was vaccinated and that there would be no major concerns. I told her about the kittens, but I forgot to mention that they had the flu. Coming to the adoption date, they all looked healthy and I didn't think much of it.

A week later, on the day I was supposed to bring the kittens over, Jenny decided to throw a small get together with 3 other friends there drinking. I was only informed of this at the last minute when I was on the way, otherwise I wouldn't have even gone. I was under the impression it would be a one-to-one session where we could talk about the kittens and discuss their needs thoroughly. To no surprise, as there were strangers and drinking going on (I drank a few beers too), a lot of information was missed out. Kittens looked healthy, but the one Jenny was going to adopt started sneezing a little.

Few hours after Jenny took the kitten, she texted me that he had pooped on the floor (diarrhea) and was pissed about it. She was also pissed that she had to feed him medication and eye drops for his flu. She was throwing all the blame at me, saying that it was a big deal.  I apologized as I should have told her about the flu earlier, but there was so much going on that it slipped by me.

A day later, Jenny returned the kitten to me and was visibly pissed because her own cat had fallen sick. I assumed that since she had the cat for awhile, it would have been vaccinated. I didn't think to ask. A week later, Jenny texted me saying that she was massively pissed and asked me ""what the fuck were you thinking?"" because her cat is now ill.

I never forced her to adopt. I made it very clear that the responsibility and decision to be educated on kittens is hers, not mine. That she should know a kitten isn't all fun and play, but also a ton of work. I've helped numerous kittens get adopted, and I have never had a problem or complaint from anyone. I've apologized and accepted part of the blame, but she seems to be lashing out and blaming me for everything.

I'm devastated. All I wanted was to find a good home for these kitties and now it's turned into such a shitshow.  Am I solely to blame here? AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit:  I didn't really forget. It was more like, the kitten had already recovered in the days leading up to the adoption. Only when I brought him out at Jenny's apartment did he start sneezing again. That's when I mentioned he had a bit of a flu and that I was giving him medication as a precaution.

WFH good salary, great benefits. We have a great house and four kids all under 16. Spouse has history of depression but is under a doctors care. The last year or so he started giving up working, spending most days taking naps or going golfing. 

I am a SAHM and we depend on his salary to live. 
I have told him numerous times that he can’t work like this because he could lose his job. I offered to help with the work or do anything that could increase his productivity. 

His boss fame gave him SO MANY chances to redeem himself and he would be excited for a bit, but the old habits soon enough resurfaced and it was back to missing meetings and assignments. 

Well as the title states, he got fired for not doing his job. We have bills that are pilling up, kids to feed, not to mention Santa is coming soon. COBRA insurance is insanely expensive but health care is a must. 

We are burning through our savings and I’m getting extremely nervous. He’s applying for jobs, but nothing has come through. 

So - AITA if I am angry and tell him so? I told him this would happen so many times and begged him to get his act together. I’m worried that if I express my anger it will only add to the stress he is under. I’m not sure what to do and I guess I am asking for advice and seeing if I am out of line.


EDITED TO ADD: 

I have a job working nights to early morning teaching online.  But it’s not enough to pay the mortgage. 

Some of my kids are not school aged and the others I teach at home. I have depression and anxiety that I’m dealing with as well.

569,yg6txl,AITA for telling my wife our son’s mental health should be more important to her than her sister’s physical health?,telling my wife our son’s mental health should be more important to her than her sister’s physical health,"Last month, my son “Will” (17) and my wife’s sister “Michelle” (22) got into a car accident and had to be hospitalized. Will had some painful but not life-threatening injuries (broken ribs, leg, some bruising) but has been deeply traumatized and distressed, and mostly just guilty because he was driving and Michelle was injured far worse. She had major head, spinal and chest injuries, clinically died multiple times and it seemed very unlikely that she would survive for the first two or so weeks after the accident. My wife ever since the accident has been completely focused on Michelle and has barely had any time for Will. When I told her I think Will has PTSD, she spoke to him for an hour and then went back to the hospital and has expected me to handle everything. I don’t mind taking care of the house or our other two kids, but i feel like I’m out of depth with Will and genuinely need her help and support there but she’s always at the hospital. I haven’t told her anything yet but now that Michelle has finally started to recover and talk clearly and walk, I told my wife that I understand what she’s going through, but she needs to spend time helping Will with his mental trauma because it looks like she doesn’t care about it from where I’m standing. She got so upset, she said Michelle (who’s about twenty years younger) is like her first child, but I said Will is actually her first child and needs her more, while Michelle has her own parents to take care of her (plus the title of the post verbatim). She accused me of not sympathizing with her and said she can’t even go one minute without thinking about Michelle and how she won’t be able to live independently for months, if not years, but I said that should be her parent’s problem, while Will should be hers. She started crying and hasn’t said anything else. I’ve been giving her some space ever since, and I’m starting to feel a little guilty.

Edit: just clarifying some details:

- Will wasn’t at fault for the accident, the other driver was. Nobody blames him, not even Michelle. Just himself. 

- I didn’t mention it, but I never told my wife to ignore Michelle, I specifically said I know she needs to take care of her but at the same time take Will’s trauma more seriously. Even if he wasn’t injured as badly, due to being her actual son, he needs attention despite the situation. Michelle is obviously important to us, but she has her parents and the entire family (parents, multiple siblings and other relatives) there to help her so my wife doesn’t need to take it upon herself to be her primary support system. She’s also shaken up but in good spirits and optimistic so it’s not like she needs psychological support. 

- Lot of comments along the lines of “what do you expect her to do.” Since he’s refusing to go to therapy, I need her help so we can make him open up about the accident and then hopefully convince him to go to therapy. My wife has always been better at talking to the kids than me, which is why I need her time and attention.

Update: 

I agree with all the YTAs about my wording and apologized to her for it, said I don’t need her to choose between Michelle and Will, just to make sure she keeps time for him because I’m not sure she’s understood what he’s been going through these past several weeks. We haven’t fully talked about it but she seems to have taken it to heart and said she’s trying to decide how to approach it with Will because he hates receiving attention and concern when he’s feeling shitty.",last month my son “will” and my wife’s sister “michelle” got into a car accident and had to be hospitalized will had some painful but not lifethreatening injuries broken ribs leg some bruising but has been deeply traumatized and distressed and mostly just guilty because he was driving and michelle was injured far worse she had major head spinal and chest injuries clinically died multiple times and it seemed very unlikely that she would survive for the first two or so weeks after the accident my wife ever since the accident has been completely focused on michelle and has barely had any time for will when i told her i think will has ptsd she spoke to him for an hour and then went back to the hospital and has expected me to handle everything i don’t mind taking care of the house or our other two kids but i feel like i’m out of depth with will and genuinely need her help and support there but she’s always at the hospital i haven’t told her anything yet but now that michelle has finally started to recover and talk clearly and walk i told my wife that i understand what she’s going through but she needs to spend time helping will with his mental trauma because it looks like she doesn’t care about it from where i’m standing she got so upset she said michelle who’s about twenty years younger is like her first child but i said will is actually her first child and needs her more while michelle has her own parents to take care of her plus the title of the post verbatim she accused me of not sympathizing with her and said she can’t even go one minute without thinking about michelle and how she won’t be able to live independently for months if not years but i said that should be her parent’s problem while will should be hers she started crying and hasn’t said anything else i’ve been giving her some space ever since and i’m starting to feel a little guilty edit just clarifying some details will wasn’t at fault for the accident the other driver was nobody blames him not even michelle just himself i didn’t mention it but i never told my wife to ignore michelle i specifically said i know she needs to take care of her but at the same time take will’s trauma more seriously even if he wasn’t injured as badly due to being her actual son he needs attention despite the situation michelle is obviously important to us but she has her parents and the entire family parents multiple siblings and other relatives there to help her so my wife doesn’t need to take it upon herself to be her primary support system she’s also shaken up but in good spirits and optimistic so it’s not like she needs psychological support lot of comments along the lines of “what do you expect her to do” since he’s refusing to go to therapy i need her help so we can make him open up about the accident and then hopefully convince him to go to therapy my wife has always been better at talking to the kids than me which is why i need her time and attention update i agree with all the ytas about my wording and apologized to her for it said i don’t need her to choose between michelle and will just to make sure she keeps time for him because i’m not sure she’s understood what he’s been going through these past several weeks we haven’t fully talked about it but she seems to have taken it to heart and said she’s trying to decide how to approach it with will because he hates receiving attention and concern when he’s feeling shitty,640,YTA
577,ygt4ri,AITA for saying I won't spend holidays with my family anymore if my mom won't let my fiancee help her cook?,saying i wont spend holidays with my family anymore if my mom wont let my fiancee help her cook,"I've been with my fiancee ""Rosie"" for 4 years and we have always rotated holidays between our two families. In her family cooking is a big deal with all of the women in the kitchen (I know and have offered help, don't come for me) and they all take part and socialize while doing it.

In my family my mom does most of the cooking. My sisters might wander in and out and help, her husband might chop some vegetables, but it is really mainly her. Her MIL stays in the kitchen with her but apparently doesn't know how to cook, or sometimes she has a friend in there. We've offered my mom help and she has politely turned it down.

Rosie has been trying to get more involved for the past couple holidays and my mom has snubbed her. Rosie confided in me that she is getting frustrated and feels that she is going to be a member of the family and has the right to be included. I talked to my mom and she suggested Rosie bring a dish and they can reheat and serve it.

At this point Rosie felt like she was being totally snubbed. I talked to my mom again and she confided in me that she finds Rosie annoying and doesn't want to be forced to spend that much time with her, and it would ""ruin"" her holidays. She said I ""can't"" get mad at her as she has never tried to break us up or even said anything, but I also shouldn't be forcing Rosie on her.

I was furious. I always felt like my mom wasn't crazy about her and borderline cold sometimes, but I couldn't believe she would just admit it like that, and that she is snubbing Rosie during family holidays because of her personal feelings. I told my mom I was disappointed in her for being selfish and immature. I talked to Rosie and we decided we can no longer spend holidays with my family. My mom called me pathetic and said I obviously want a fake relationship if she can't even tell me how she feels. Everyone else in the family texted me pretty much all telling me that I am a huge asshole.",ive been with my fiancee rosie for years and we have always rotated holidays between our two families in her family cooking is a big deal with all of the women in the kitchen i know and have offered help dont come for me and they all take part and socialize while doing it in my family my mom does most of the cooking my sisters might wander in and out and help her husband might chop some vegetables but it is really mainly her her mil stays in the kitchen with her but apparently doesnt know how to cook or sometimes she has a friend in there weve offered my mom help and she has politely turned it down rosie has been trying to get more involved for the past couple holidays and my mom has snubbed her rosie confided in me that she is getting frustrated and feels that she is going to be a member of the family and has the right to be included i talked to my mom and she suggested rosie bring a dish and they can reheat and serve it at this point rosie felt like she was being totally snubbed i talked to my mom again and she confided in me that she finds rosie annoying and doesnt want to be forced to spend that much time with her and it would ruin her holidays she said i cant get mad at her as she has never tried to break us up or even said anything but i also shouldnt be forcing rosie on her i was furious i always felt like my mom wasnt crazy about her and borderline cold sometimes but i couldnt believe she would just admit it like that and that she is snubbing rosie during family holidays because of her personal feelings i told my mom i was disappointed in her for being selfish and immature i talked to rosie and we decided we can no longer spend holidays with my family my mom called me pathetic and said i obviously want a fake relationship if she cant even tell me how she feels everyone else in the family texted me pretty much all telling me that i am a huge asshole,375,YTA
582,yhamdv,AITA for confronting my friends?,confronting my friends,"My first time writing my thoughts on Reddit on this subject, so here we go.

Since i was 5 years old, my mother passed away. She contracted ALS shortly after giving birth to me. My aunt is my mother's older sister who has taken good care of me and my family since my mother died. My aunt sacrificed everything to take care of my family. I consider her as my own mother. I have a sense of responsibility to make my aunt happy. At least it's something I can do everyday.

I have friends named ""Alex"" and ""Ben"". We've been friends since high school. We have become close friends so we always entrust everything to each other. I myself am also happy to know them. But that all changed back in November 2021.

I was visiting Ben's house and saw that Alex & Ben and some of my other friends were having a group chat without me in it. I had a bad feeling and Ben was away. I read the conversation they had. And I was surprised because they mentioned me with all kinds of negative things. I am angry. I was blinded by my anger and I logged into Ben's account on my phone without him knowing to see how far the group conversation went. At that time I could only be silent and take a deep breath as to whether my attitude and behavior in the past made them say negative things about me. When Ben came back I couldn't help but smile painfully knowing that my friend was talking behind my back.

December 2021. My aunt was rushed to the hospital, I panicked and stressed because she is one of the people I care about. I spent all my savings for a month and now she is doing well. I told Ben my aunt's condition after she was released from the hospital.

After that, the new year 2022 comes. It hasn't even been a day until January 2, 2022. I saw Ben's group chat. I saw Ben saying the stuff i told Ben. I didn't tell anyone about it except Ben. Alex replied to the chat with one sentence that i still remembered to this day. ""My aunt is in the hospital, I want to tell Ben a dramatic story. That bastard can't be an adult or what? Hahaha."" said Alex.

I snapped. I know that Alex and Ben were hanging out in the park at the time. I went straight to them and vented all sorts of anger on them. I took out my cellphone and showed the contents of their conversation so far. Alex and Ben were shocked and angry at that. They said they were disappointed with my behavior that I should respect people's privacy. I haven't seen them again since then. My social media account is blocked by Alex. I cut ties with the people in the conversation, including Ben.

302 days and counting. I still can't get those those memory out of my head. I introspect myself and behavior during that time. Part of me still hate myself for violating Ben's privacy but there's also a part of me wishing I could go back in time and not read their group chats at all. Until now, I did the right thing or not. And i still don't know if what i did made me an asshole. What do you think?  


EDIT: Thanks for some of the answers that have been given to me. I apologize that I justified my behavior at that time in anger. Now I'm relieved to tell this story and I know and admit my fatal mistake for invading my friend's privacy, although the way to get information about my friends against myself can be done in other more ethical ways. Now, I will introspect myself again and try to go to a psychologist, and be ready to look for new friendships in the future.",my first time writing my thoughts on reddit on this subject so here we go since i was years old my mother passed away she contracted als shortly after giving birth to me my aunt is my mothers older sister who has taken good care of me and my family since my mother died my aunt sacrificed everything to take care of my family i consider her as my own mother i have a sense of responsibility to make my aunt happy at least its something i can do everyday i have friends named alex and ben weve been friends since high school we have become close friends so we always entrust everything to each other i myself am also happy to know them but that all changed back in november i was visiting bens house and saw that alex ben and some of my other friends were having a group chat without me in it i had a bad feeling and ben was away i read the conversation they had and i was surprised because they mentioned me with all kinds of negative things i am angry i was blinded by my anger and i logged into bens account on my phone without him knowing to see how far the group conversation went at that time i could only be silent and take a deep breath as to whether my attitude and behavior in the past made them say negative things about me when ben came back i couldnt help but smile painfully knowing that my friend was talking behind my back december my aunt was rushed to the hospital i panicked and stressed because she is one of the people i care about i spent all my savings for a month and now she is doing well i told ben my aunts condition after she was released from the hospital after that the new year comes it hasnt even been a day until january i saw bens group chat i saw ben saying the stuff i told ben i didnt tell anyone about it except ben alex replied to the chat with one sentence that i still remembered to this day my aunt is in the hospital i want to tell ben a dramatic story that bastard cant be an adult or what hahaha said alex i snapped i know that alex and ben were hanging out in the park at the time i went straight to them and vented all sorts of anger on them i took out my cellphone and showed the contents of their conversation so far alex and ben were shocked and angry at that they said they were disappointed with my behavior that i should respect peoples privacy i havent seen them again since then my social media account is blocked by alex i cut ties with the people in the conversation including ben days and counting i still cant get those those memory out of my head i introspect myself and behavior during that time part of me still hate myself for violating bens privacy but theres also a part of me wishing i could go back in time and not read their group chats at all until now i did the right thing or not and i still dont know if what i did made me an asshole what do you think edit thanks for some of the answers that have been given to me i apologize that i justified my behavior at that time in anger now im relieved to tell this story and i know and admit my fatal mistake for invading my friends privacy although the way to get information about my friends against myself can be done in other more ethical ways now i will introspect myself again and try to go to a psychologist and be ready to look for new friendships in the future,649,YTA
585,yh6ezr,AITA for telling my fiancé to F off and hitting a sore spot?,telling my fiancé to f off and hitting a sore spot,"For context, I(29F) and my fiancé, Kevin(30M), have been together for almost 6 years & engaged for 2 months now. I have a guy best friend, Andy(32M), for over a decade. I met Andy online when I was 16 & he had been with me throughout some traumatic experiences of my life. And soon, I had fallen in love with him completely, but we were just best friends on the outside. Everything was going on smoothly until I went to meet Andy & Sush(I met her at 18& in college)tagged along. They're instantly drawn to each other & soon began dating. 

At 22, I moved out of state for higher studies where I met Kevin. The first impression wasn't great but we got grouped for a project & became good buddies over two years. Things between us changed and we began dating & soon became official. I was mostly LC with Andy and Sush & only visited them during holidays with Kevin. So coming to the present, the three of us are in the same city due to our jobs while Sush is gonna be SAHM(she's 3 months pregnant). Andy proposed to her last year & they're getting married next week. The thing is, I used to write during the hard times of my life which escalated, but with positivity after I met Andy. He was kinda my muse, but I stopped writing, both due to university stress & lack of any ideas. But I had written a beautiful poem congratulating him on his love-life & wishing him all the best for the future which I've decided to read at the wedding speech. 

The issue; Kevin, when he got to know about the poem, started being mean and condescending, talking about how I never wrote anything for him, how I always prioritised Andy over him(Andy and I hardly talk now if not about his marriage). Yeah, he knows about Andy being my first love & all, and he was fine with that, with a bit of negative reaction considering I was still friends with my first love.
All of us have come on a beautiful vacation, &  Kevin & I are planning to throw a small party here to congratulate the couple. This morning Kevin brought up the topic once again & started berating Andy & me & throwing accusations like how I still might be in love with Andy and how he felt like being an affair partner when I should be the one feeling like a side-chick which hit a sensitive spot. He demanded me to cut off all contacts with Andy & we started arguing back & forth.

At some point, things got heated as he brought up my insecurities, & I told him to f*ck off and go to his Mom if he had so many problems. Well, bad choice as Kevin didn't have a good relationship with his mother & went NC after he turned 18. He went quiet all of a sudden & stormed out of the room. I realised my mistake but it was too late. Now he's not answering any of my calls or replying to any of my texts & while I'm apologetic for my outburst and can understand where he stands, he also shouldn't have brought up my insecurities, so am I TA?

Update: Thank you people for your opinions. While I acknowledge I'm the AH, I've apologized to Kevin. He's still  mad and we've decided to go on a break to reconsider our relationship.

My uncle would so that's what I chose. We had discussed Gemma and I had said no way did I want to stay with them. In theory I could stay on my own too but they wanted me to have adults around. Plus my uncle and aunt are going to help my grandparents when they get out of the hospital.

Gemma kept calling and pestering and one day I answered my grandpa's phone, which I have permission to do, when I saw her name and I told her to stop bugging them. She told me she wanted them to let me stay with her family for a while so I could get to know everyone. I told her I knew what she wanted but I didn't want to stay with them and that I had made the choice of where to go. Gemma got upset. Asked me why I hadn't wanted to stay with them. She said she had always hoped the time would come where I would integrate myself back into her family and be her child again. I told her I had never seen her as my parent and had never considered myself her child. She ended the call saying my dad would have been so disappointed in me. That he had wanted me to stay with her and my half sisters (which I know is true, because he had written that) and would hate to see me decide living with extended family was more important. I told her it was what I wanted and had no regrets. She called me cruel then.

She told me to not talk to her anymore even as I suggested searching for local mechanics and such.

I’ve held two officer positions, created & managed a very successful social media account for the union, led the planning for our recent picket, got us tons of news/media coverage, & served on our bargaining team. I became friends with a nurse who decided to serve on our bargaining team this year. She has been a nurse in our union for almost 20 years, but this was her official first involvement with the union. I have only been a nurse for 4 years but have been involved since year 2. I have had numerous conversations with her over the last few months where I literally begged her to consider becoming more involved as an officer once our bargaining season was up. 

One of our current co-chairs announced she is retiring and I have made my intentions of going for that role extremely clear after I got the blessings of the other union officers and the other co-chair (about 4-6 months ago). So now this friend decided to run against me & the current co-chair, despite saying she wasn’t sure she had time to be involved. She is still telling people that she knows she can’t make it her top priority but she feels she needs to run because a few friends nominated her (and she self-nominated..). I tried explaining that this both hurt personally and professionally as well as that I genuinely think it is not wise as she has zero experience and would rely (I.e. lean) far too heavily on the co-chair. Things have turned pretty ugly. I respect that she has a right to run, but wow does it feel personal! I keep wavering on feeling like I’m being petty or justifiably angry…. So AITA?

My ex husband and I are divorced. We share custody of our 5 & 3 years old kids together. He's been struggling with health issues for about a year now.

He had a surgery scheduled and asked if I'd let him have them the day before the surgery but I politely declined since it was my time to have them and any switch in schedule might affect my work.

The day of the surgery, His girlfriend called me from the hospital and put him on the phone. He asked how I was doing (basically his go-to method to ask for something) then asked if I could let the kids facetime him before he went into surgery. I said I was at work but he asked if I could take a break, go home and let the children facetime him for 10 minutes. I said I was sorry but refused. I promised I'd have the kids see him post surgery but he started arguing with me. He said that it was unfair enough I didn't let him have the kids the day before and that he felt like facetiming them before the surgery was reasonable enough. I had to end the call since there was so much commotion for my coworkers to hear. His girlfriend called back but I refused to respond.

I got off work at 7pm and his girlfriend called asking if ""I was happy"". and said that he literally cried after the call was ended and after I refused to do what he asked. She called me unbelieveable and spiteful for having no consideration for my kids if not their dad and what he's going through. I said I wasn't going to interrupt work when I was already busy. She said that I was making excuses and that she ""felt sorry"" for the kids implying I was being deliberately hurtful in my behavior which I'm not! It's just that I had to work.

Indeterminate aged overweight woman who is decent enough at her job and organizes all the office parties so she won’t get fired but at the same time nearly zero interpersonal skills and is the office gossip. 

It’s started to get cooler (yet far from cold) and Debbie brought in a space heater for under her desk. They are specifically prohibited in our office policy btw. Debbie would crank this thing up and though I’m on the other side of the cubicle, the space at my feet would feel like it was molten lava. I asked Debbie to turn it off, she said no that her feet have poor circulation so she needs the heater. I said maybe she could wear socks. She said they didn’t go her her heels. I said so you’re not turning the heater off would she compromise and maybe use it just part of the day instead of full blast all day. 

I went to HR and they said they “talked” with Debbie but there was nothing they could do and with their audit coming up they have bigger fish to fry and advised me to “wait it out” and maybe it won’t be so uncomfortable in the winter. 

Debbie was gone all day yesterday and left her heater on. I couldn’t take it anymore so I took a screwdriver and broke the heating coil. Debbie got back and like a true idiot she couldn’t figure out what was going on. I guess this heater was like 60 years old and the replacement she found on Amazon is a tower heater which won’t fit under her desk. My problem is solved but her cubicle mates are in for hell.

I told my wife what I did and she said that we need to apologize to Debbie and replace her heater with one that works for her. She said what I did was really terrible and there are ways to handle these things. I told her I may be an asshole for breaking it but I’m not replacing it to cause me more grief.

Lots of things we both like about it, a few things need some improvement. One area where my wife and I disagree on is whether to replace all of the kitchen appliances. They are all perfectly functional, but they're white -- and she wants stainless steel. I estimate it will cost $4,000 to swap out our refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, and oven.

I told my wife this is not a good use of money, and we should spend that on new furniture for our new house (we only own a small ikea couch, but would like a larger sectional).

However, she's adamant about wanting to realize her ""dream kitchen"". We did unfortunately compromise a bit on the the kitchen for this house -- it's smaller than she would have really liked, and the counter-space is relatively limited. So she wants to make the most of the space that we have. I'll be working on replacing all of the countertops, the sink, re-doing the backsplash, and painting the cabinets (we both agreed on those points).

Now to be fair, she does work full time + a side gig. So I feel like she should be free to spend money on whatever she wants. But I can't help but interject my opinion. I feel like an asshole because it's something she really wants, and she should have a say over how our money is spent.

Around 2 months ago, I found out I was pregnant. I told Anna, and asked her to tell Elsa. She agreed, and later, she said Elsa wanted me to announce it at her wedding so it would be double the fun. I happily agreed.

During the reception, I stood up and announced I was pregnant. Everyone was excited for me, but Elsa. She started weeping and called me an asshole.

I confronted Anna. She confessed that she had fought with Elsa before her vacation and she wasn't mailing her anything. Anna wanted to ruin Elsa's wedding and I was an unwitting accomplice. I went to apoligize to Elsa and told her the whole story. Luckily, she forgave me.

623,yjnpzj,AITA for refusing to pay the veterinary bills for a dog my dog mauled?,refusing to pay the veterinary bills for a dog my dog mauled,"Throwaway. 

I rescued my dog from a rescue a few months ago, they let me know he does not get along with other dogs so I have taken care to avoid him being around other dogs. I have not yet seen him interact with other dogs due to this.
I tend to walk him at night around 9 or 10 pm as there’s usually no one outside at this time, so I don’t have to try to dodge all the other dogs being walked in the neighborhood. 

My dog was on a leash, we were walking at a brisk pace and as we turned a corner, to my surprise we nearly ran into another couple walking their small chihuahua-like dog. My dog LUNGED for their dog with a speed and ferocity that caught me off guard, the leash slipped from my hands and my dog attacked their dog. My dog is a good sized boxer/lab mix (although he could just be a pitbull mix and the rescue listed him as a boxer/lab to help with his adoption chances) and I feared he would legitimately kill the other dog. It was awful, we were all screaming, I managed to grab the leash and drag my dog away but some damage had definitely been done. 
I exchanged contact info with the owners and they rushed him to the ER. I originally wanted to do the right thing and help pay for medical bills. I live in a high COL area and I figured it would be expensive, but they let me know the estimated cost to save their dog is at nearly twenty thousand dollars so far. And it could potentially increase.

I did not believe them at first, but they forwarded the estimate bill to me and offered to bring me to the hospital to see for myself. The price quote is real. The dog has broken ribs and is oxygen dependent, they want to give him at least one blood transfusion and hospitalise for several days. 

There is no world in which I can afford that. That’s ridiculous. I said I would pay for euthanasia or contribute 5k towards the bill.

My wife pleaded with me to let him go trick-or-treating, but I refused. Her defense was that he only missed three words out of twenty, but that’s an 85%.

But we are not together, we are just really close friends who trust each other a lot.

We went to a halloween party and had our arms around each other.

I (37 F) decided a couple months ago with my husband (40 M) that it was time to get our kids a dog because they were old enough to care for one. My kids are Rose (8 F) and Isabella (10 F). My husband had a boxer as a kid and said that he has fond memories with that kind of dog so we decided to get one and surprise the kids. He is now five months old. I'm sure many of you will understand that because he is a puppy he needs a lot of exercise because he is very high energy. We often take him on walks at the park near our house because it has several very long walking paths.

Well, this past weekend there was an event going on at the lower half of the park, so it was closed off so all we had left was the top half. It was just me and my daughter Rose because my husband had to pick up Isabella from a friend's house. While at the park my daughter kept begging me to hold Coopers leash. After a while I gave in. While Rose was walking him another dog came by and Cooper got excited and started running over which pulled my daughter who let go of the leash. Cooper ran over to the other dog trying to play and all of a sudden I heard screaming at me to ""get my dog"". My daughter ran over and started crying while the girl (2oish F?) held her dog down with her arm in his mouth and screamed at me to stop standing there. The man with her started yelling at me to stop my dog who was jumping with excitement. After the shock wore off, I rushed over and removed my dog checking Cooper and Rose. The man with her started yelling at me that I was being irresponsible by letting the dog walk free in a leash required area and that people like them take their rescues there for training and I probably just destroyed months work of progress with their dog. I explained he was being held but my daughter dropped by accident and that he needed to stop yelling as it was scaring my kid. He started yelling that if my daughter wasn't strong enough to hold the dog she shouldn't be walking it or take it to a unleashed area to practice. When we got home Rose was still crying. When my husband asked what happened and I told him, he was angry at me telling me that I need to be more responsible and that I was at fault.

AITA for pretending to use sign language when a group of teens wanted a seat on the bus

As the title suggests, I “pretended” to use sign language to get out of giving up a seat to a group of teens. 

I (16m) was sitting on the bus and was using up two seats, one for me and one for my bag. This was about the time school lets out. 

My bus made a stop and a group of (i assume) teenagers got on. they were being very loud and obnoxious but  ignored them. They then made their way up to where i was sitting.  There were a couple of them asking if i could move my stuff so their friend could sit down.  I being fed up with the day decide to ignore them, thinking they would either stand or find somewhere else to sit.

A few second go by and i hear to my left “no need to be rude sofia the first” (i assume referencing to the TV show and  calling me a princess). They continue to try and get my attention. Eventually, one dude grabs my book bag and places it on top of my lap and then sits in the seat next to me. 

I’m trying to find a way to get out of this situation when the dude says “if she has a problem then we can fight!” I wanting no issues decide to sign at the guy “who are you”. 

side note: i am not deaf or hard of hearing. sign language was just the first language i was taught as a kid, so i know basic sentences. I also sometimes use ASL to communicate when i don’t feel like talking.

He then starts trying to apologise because he assumes i am deaf. He is like frantically asking siri “how to apologise in deaf language”. His friends are saying stuff like “you’re gonna go to hell”. 

Finally the bus pulls up to my stop and i motion that i have to get off. As i am stepping outside of the bus i half yell “have a nice day” and i turn back to see the same guy give me the middle finger.

639,yjmfn3,AITA for calling my neighbor out for calling my landlord?,calling my neighbor out for calling my landlord,"I 30 female have a family of 7. Myself, my husband and our 5 children. We moved into our home 3 years ago. We have a good standing relationship with our landlord and most of our neighbors. When we moved into our home we began a relationship with our next door neighbors. It was an elderly man and his adult daughter. We became good friends and often would stand at our backdoor and chat sometimes for an hour. Last year the daughter got engaged, married and moved in with her husband. So it was just our elderly neighbor. Till early this year when he sadly passed away. Everyone was devastated especially his daughter. She is an only child and lost her mom young. 

Spring time came and her and her husband moved back in next door and it was fine. We never had any problems. They are childless but understand that sometimes kids don't listen and never complained when we yelled. They eventually started looking for a different home to buy as the homes we are in are fairly small and we also live in a shady area. Drug addicts and dealers at least three in the direct area. They eventually found a home, closed the deal and over the summer moved but they hadn't sold the home next to mine. 

They recently have listed it and they have been texting me constantly asking for us to clean the yard which in reality isn't that bad. There was a few bags of garbage because we got behind and garbage pick up is only every other week and we only have so much space in the bins the city gives us. I have been trying to be as understanding as possible and even have moved the garbage that I can't fit in my bin to the other side of my garage so it is out of sight. I hadn't heard anything about it for a few days till today when my landlords daughter called me because my neighbor called her. 

I explained the situation and thankfully they were understanding. I told them the mess really isn't that bad and I'm trying my best. That was it. But afterwards I went into my yard and tried to do absolutely everything I could but nothing seemed unsightly. I still cleaned it up as best as I could especially since I have severe back issues. I eventually threw my back out because I moved something heavy. After I sent my neighbor a text letting her know I am trying my best and I think there was miscommunication and next time to be more clear what she needed before she contacted my landlord. But at the same time I feel like I shouldn't be going above and beyond for her because my home has no bearing on hers. Again it's not as bad as she makes it out to be. 

So am I the asshole for calling her out?

I have a 19 year old daughter, the second oldest of 5 still living at home. I don't force her to do much but sometimes I would like for her to do pull some of her weight around the house and help out.

Last night I was invited out by my girlfriends to a halloween party so I asked my daughter to take her little siblings trick or treating. Not that big of a deal but apparently that was too much for her. She told me that she had plans to go to a halloween party with her friends that night and didn't think it was fair to suddenly drop this on her. 

Well I didn't see it that way. she doesn't pay rent. Sure she goes to college but she can make time for her siblings sometimes. I tried explaining that to her but this all became a huge fight. She crossed the line and told me that if I didn't want to watch my chilren than I shouldn't have had so many.

I was livid. I told her that she was right and I should have stopped at one. At which point she started crying and stormed up to her room. I thought it was important to set firm rules so I yelled up and told her that if she doesn't take her siblings trick or treating then she's grounded. I left for the halloween party not long after and she did take her siblings trick or treating. 

Now it's the next day and she's refusing to talk to me.

648,yjlr4e,AITA for kicking out my teen and their boyfriend?,kicking out my teen and their boyfriend,"Throwaway cause my teen has Reddit.

I (F62) have one child from my ex husband ""Andrew"" (M57). They came out to me as Nonbinary when they were 17, they are now 19. In June of 2021 their boyfriend (M20) moved in with us in my mother's home. (My mother has dementia and lives in a nursing home.) My teen has multiple health issues, both physical and mental. This is important later on.
When they turned 18, I started charging my teen rent ($500/month which is cheap in our area.) I charged their boyfriend the same amount. The boyfriend has always been a very handy person and has fixed a lot of things in my home. The house is the same age as me and my mother never has had it renovated. He has done the work around the house after his actual job as a manager at a local restaurant chain. He has asked that he's either compensated for his work or that he gets money off his rent for the month. I've told him no everytime as I've never asked him to do the work. I think it's ridiculous that I should have to pay for something I've never asked him to do. (ie rehanging doors that don't close, redoing the kitchen floors since they're old, mowing both the front and backyard.) 
In late April of this year my teen got Covid-19. Because of their health issues they were hospitalized for over a month and lost their job because of it. I still expected them to pay rent, which they refused since they ""Had no job and weren't even home."" The boyfriend called me heartless and that he wouldn't be paying their rent either. I decided to keep my mouth shut and ask at a later date. 
When my teen returned, they stayed downstairs because the doctor said they should avoid stairs as much as possible. The boyfriend brought down an AC that they had bought from me and set it up in the room for them. He bought an air mattress for them. I asked if he could afford an air mattress why couldn't he afford to give me their rent? He ignored me.
A week passed and the boyfriend knocked on my door and demanded I ""let him borrow"" the fan I had in the basement. I told him no. Then I got a phone call from my teen asking why I wouldn't let him ""borrow"" the fan until they were able to bring the AC back to the bedroom they shared. I left my house, and went to the library. I was tired of being disrespected in my own home and returned with two eviction papers.
From what I've heard my teen ended up in a homeless shelter in a city 2 hours away and their boyfriend is somewhere on the west coast. After their 30 days were up at the shelter my Teen texted and asked me to take them in. I told them no as I can't trust that they'll be respectful towards me.

653,yjljik,WIBTA My ex blocked me after I did a favor for her,wibta my ex blocked me after i did a favor for her,"So I dated a girl in high school for two years. With that amount of time things got somewhat serious. Although when college came around it became long distance and things quickly fell apart from there. After we broke off we cut off communication. Although she would routinely text me every now and then asking for favors or saying things I considered to be odd. 

She would text me and say she was wearing the necklace I got her. Or ask for $100 to get her car out of impound a few things like that. (I didn’t give her the money to get the car out). Which brings us around to where we are now a few months ago she asked me to pick her up from our local airport. It’s maybe 30 mins away not a big deal. I did go through asking if literally anyone else could pick her up. 

Eventually I reluctantly agreed to pick her up and drop her off if she gave me my hoodie back. She agreed. At the time I pick her up I find out she didn’t bring my hoodie. I end up dropping her off at a friends house she thanked me and said she would Venmo me for gas money. Here’s the twist no one was expecting she didn’t pay my shocker. (Picking her up from the airport on the Friday before labor weekend) I didn’t hear from here for a while. 

She ended up adding me back on snap. We did snap back and forth for a while. We talked about everything that happened between us and I finally started to get a feeling of closure. Which was a relief. Anyways I got the impression she was kinda flirting a little through out this. Granted a lot of it was backhanded complements like wow you learned how to dress, and why did you have to get more attractive after we broke up. We do this for maybe a month or two then she ask me for another ride from the airport. Once again I told her I would if she brought my hoodie. 

Anyways I pick her up and once again no hoodie was returned. I drop her off again and she says thank you and such. She told me she would bring it back when she comes back during thanks giving break. This conversation was in late October maybe 5 days ago. Anyways I go home after dropping her off and a few hours later I noticed she removed me on snap. I texted her saying “unadded me on snap?” She ignored the text and hasn’t responded. I’ve been considering what to do. My main idea is just a paragraph saying you don’t want to talk that’s fine just drop my hoodie off at my house when ur back in town. I’ve given her plenty of opportunities where I went to here to get the hoodie and I’m not sure I want to see her again much less interact as it just bring back memories that would be easier to just forget. 

But given how she has flaked on it twice part of me is contemplating texting her mom and ask her to remind her daughter. I got to know the parents Farley well and she said she missed having me around not to long ago. So I feel like it wouldn’t be completely out of turn to do that.

I was definitely walking around a lot, just taking pictures and vibing. We do have concrete/wood floors but I didn’t really think it would be an issue because it was only 8pm when I put it on. 

Today, I found a note on our door from our downstairs neighbor that said that it was inconsiderate to wear high heels and that I was being really loud. They also said that me and my BF have been stomping constantly in the note and that because I was stomping around past 1 am that they missed their morning alarm for work (I will admit I was pacing around just doing some random stuff around the apartment and didn’t settle in until around 2am). I just don’t feel like I should have to walk quietly in my own space, I want to be able to work out and walk around but it’s hard to not walk on my heel. 

in the note they say they wear earplugs, so I feel a little bit bad that they can hear all this through the air plugs, but I also feel they are being way too sensitive. My BF is a big guy and it’s hard for him to be quieter.

661,yjl4f2,AITA for asking my girlfriend to make a safety deposit before we plan a date?,asking my girlfriend to make a safety deposit before we plan a date," Please note that this is not your usual relationship. I've been dating a borderline diagnosed girl for half a year. She's great and I love her, but I have a problem with her flaking me.

We met online, we chatted for a month and we were extremely excited to meet each other in a hotel, last summer. A week before she asked me if it would be a problem if we delayed our meeting by a week. *Why? -- because my boss asked me to come on Sunday*. It was a temporary job and not a career worth sweating over, she quit it herself a month later.

The problem is, being flaked or postponed (without a good reason) is an intense CPTSD trigger for me. My father went to buy bread and it took him 8 years to return. And many other stories from my childhood. Whatever. I communicated it as clearly as I could, asking her to avoid doing that again.

The situation repeated once again. She was supposed to fly over to my country, we were looking to rent a studio together. I needed her to be present to aid me in the search. Everything was planned with mutual agreement. Suddenly, she said she's gonna come a week later. That's one of the variables that led me to ending up homeless (as my previous contract was running out).

I flied to her country, she was begging me to come over and visit her. She refused to pick me up from the airport because I hurt her feelings a few days earlier. And she didn't pick up the phone for two days.

After two days of waiting for her in her country, we made up and finally met. I was renting a single room in a hostel. She spent a night with me. The next day we went to rent a double room. We were very happy. She went to work, I waited for her.

That evening, she messaged me that she will be spending the night somewhere else. I asked why. She said it's because she's having a job interview tomorrow. *But why didn't you tell me?* \-- *Well, I found that job offer while you were sleeping last night*. My CPTSD was triggered again, I spent the night walking around the hostel to calm down, drinking beer and doing unhealthy things to cope.

Two months later, she's asking me to fly again. I told her that I can, but I require her to make a symbolic refundable deposit of 400 EUR - if she does show up, she will get it all back. If she flakes me again, I will use that money to cope by spending it on hoes. My reasoning is that if she doesn't feel guilty about breaking promises, if she doesn't feel the obligation emotionally, then maybe she will feel it financially.

In total, if I remember correctly, she flaked me 5 times. Each one hurt. Each time it was brought up, she got very defensive, *what's your problem - my best friend doesn't mind when I do that to him.*

She's laughing and saying that it's a ridiculous request. *My BF requires a deposit to see me hahahhah*.

We went on a vacation with my sister, her husband, their 2 girls (14 and 12), and my brother, his wife, their 2 girls (15 and 13), and their son (20). 

The house we booked has a huge bunkroom that all of the girls were going to sleep in. There were 2 bunk beds with trundle beds underneath and a single bed. Amelia is very sick and can't sleep on the top bunk because she has a hard time getting up and down the ladder. The trundles are also out of the question because she has a hard time standing up when she's that close to the ground. That leaves the bottom bunks and the single bed. I told my brother and sister that Amelia needs the bottom bunks or single bed. They both said that should be fine. 

We got to the house and the girls ran to start calling their beds. Usually when we all travel somewhere, the girls choose their beds in order from oldest to youngest but I assumed my brother and sister talked to their kids about Amelia needing either the bottom bunk or single beds. Anyway, Amelia was left with a top bunk. 

She came to tell me what happened so I went to talk to my daughters and nieces and see if anyone was willing to switch with Amelia. Everyone, including my daughters, said it's not a big deal, they've always chosen beds this way, and the top bunks aren't even that high up. I told Amelia she was going to sleep in the bedroom with me and my wife. She was upset about it but we told her it's better for her because she needs to sleep early and take naps anyway. 

She went to play with her cousins and everything was okay the first day but on the second day, she ran to us crying because her cousins were teasing her for sleeping in her parents bed instead of the top bunk. We talked to them again but they brushed us off. Then I asked my older two why they didn't defend her but they said they didn't think it was a big deal and she's old enough to defend herself. Amelia clung to us for the rest of the day and was feeling miserable. We couldn't get her to play with her cousins so we decided to end the trip early and go home. 

My older two were furious that we ended the trip early because she was ""too spoiled for the top bunk"" and ""couldn't handle a little teasing"". My brother and sister agree that she was acting a little spoiled and that I shouldn't have ruined the vacation for my older two because of her so now I'm wondering if I was the asshole.",my wife and i have girls anna ava amelia we went on a vacation with my sister her husband their girls and and my brother his wife their girls and and their son the house we booked has a huge bunkroom that all of the girls were going to sleep in there were bunk beds with trundle beds underneath and a single bed amelia is very sick and cant sleep on the top bunk because she has a hard time getting up and down the ladder the trundles are also out of the question because she has a hard time standing up when shes that close to the ground that leaves the bottom bunks and the single bed i told my brother and sister that amelia needs the bottom bunks or single bed they both said that should be fine we got to the house and the girls ran to start calling their beds usually when we all travel somewhere the girls choose their beds in order from oldest to youngest but i assumed my brother and sister talked to their kids about amelia needing either the bottom bunk or single beds anyway amelia was left with a top bunk she came to tell me what happened so i went to talk to my daughters and nieces and see if anyone was willing to switch with amelia everyone including my daughters said its not a big deal theyve always chosen beds this way and the top bunks arent even that high up i told amelia she was going to sleep in the bedroom with me and my wife she was upset about it but we told her its better for her because she needs to sleep early and take naps anyway she went to play with her cousins and everything was okay the first day but on the second day she ran to us crying because her cousins were teasing her for sleeping in her parents bed instead of the top bunk we talked to them again but they brushed us off then i asked my older two why they didnt defend her but they said they didnt think it was a big deal and shes old enough to defend herself amelia clung to us for the rest of the day and was feeling miserable we couldnt get her to play with her cousins so we decided to end the trip early and go home my older two were furious that we ended the trip early because she was too spoiled for the top bunk and couldnt handle a little teasing my brother and sister agree that she was acting a little spoiled and that i shouldnt have ruined the vacation for my older two because of her so now im wondering if i was the asshole,467,YTA
673,yjjstb,AITA for changing my adoptive son's name and telling off his birth family,changing my adoptive sons name and telling off his birth family,"*names are changed for anonymity of course*
My husband and I  took in his cousin Sues newborn due to her and her partner Johns addiction issues. 
Its not a decision I regret. This beautiful boy is the light of my life but it was a major life change for us. Especially me as I was the one who gave up my job and my social life to be basically locked up isolated during covid with a baby. It was supposed to be temporary while they went to rehab. They never went to rehab nor complied with any of the safety plan set up by  CPS. From 2 months on they have not seen the baby nor supported him in any way. Johns family has not been involved either as they also refused to abide by the safetyplan or any of the CPS recommendations.
Now 2 years later my husband and I have full legal custody and CPS has closed the file. We have put forth a petition to change the baby's name. At birth john and sue named the boy Steven to ""honor"" John's brother who died of an overdose (while partying with John and Sue who was PREGNANT and getting high) 
My husband and I have never ever referred to the baby by that name. We always called him Davey (his middle name) after Sue and my husband's grandfather.
So instead of being Steven David Jones we are changing it to David Owen Smith. Owen is after my father who absolutely adores him and accepted him as grandson from day one.
So here's where I might have ventured to asshole. My husband thinks I went too far but I feel they pushed me to the end.
John's family found out and blew up my social media and messaging.(not husbands just mine) Telling me that I have no right to change the name or honour my father because I'm nothing more than a babysitter and I'm not the real mother. I was called a babythief amongst more vile accusations. So I snapped and  responded back that MY son's names will honour good men that he could proudly emulate not like their junkie relative who was a shitstain on the world defrauding the govt for benefits and stealing from anyone he could and contributed nothing to life or society and his only accomplishment is that he odeed before he went to prison. Harsh.yes. but I still don't feel like I'm the asshole.

*edit for clarity*

I did not change the name on my own. My husband was very involved in the decision as were our 2  daughters who helped name their baby brother.

679,yj9wlq,AITA Monthly Open Forum November 2022: Civility,monthly open forum november civility,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

###This month’s deep dive will be on how we enforce rule 1, our civility rule. And about how we fucked with the sub again by updating the language of rule 1. 

Civility can be a bit hard to define. Especially in a sub about assholes. Maintaining civility is one of the most important pieces that allows this sub to function, and as such is where we spend much of our moderation efforts. Users spending more effort one-upping each other for the best burn actively works against the productive conversations that those posting find valuable. This month’s deep dive is going to be pretty long; so strap in and [hold onto your butts](https://media3.giphy.com/media/OCu7zWojqFA1W/giphy.gif):

Civility is a big concept, and one that many people define in different ways. It’s also contextual; what you define as civil in your workplace is going to be different from what’s civil in your group chat, which is also different from what’s civil in a pottery class. As such civility is more a [term of art](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/term%20of%20art) for this subreddit, and one that we work to define specifically for this space. In doing so our goal is to ensure this is a community that people are willing to engage with. Posters are opening themselves up and making themselves incredibly vulnerable - sometimes even posting about people they care about. It’s important that they feel free to get the judgment they need without feeling personally attacked - otherwise many wouldn’t be interested in sharing. In order to ensure we’re providing the most valuable feedback we also want to make sure users are willing to judge and engage without feeling personally attacked for sharing - which again is something civility is important for.


Given the context of the subreddit, where we’re not just having abstract discussions of morality but instead having those in the context where real people have been wronged this can be a tricky line to draw. It’s understandable it might not line up with what everyone expects when they see the word civility - because again the definition of that word is contextual. We don’t look at whether the words used are “nice” words, or if we agree with them. Our role as moderators is not to ensure every opinion expressed reflects our values, but to instead maintain a space for users to engage in civil discourse. So, the first line of rule 1 acts as our definition of civility: “Attack ideas, not people.” 

We ask if the comment is attacking the person or the behavior. Recognizing variances to how severe different insults are taken by different people we’ve drawn the line on insults at “no insults at all”. “Asshole” and “sucks” are the only exception to this as those are our flairs, one’s the name of the sub, and mostly because we use them to mean “person in the wrong.”   

Attacking the person isn’t just about insults. It covers other behavior listed in rule 1 of Reddit’s content policy, like [harassment](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043071072) and [promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951). Mocking people or groups, especially based on vulnerability, is not ok. Harassing a user, or following them around the site, is not ok. Just like the content policy points out, being annoying or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. That’s just being an average redditor. Cursing or swearing doesn’t break rule 1. Getting into spats, on the other hand, does. 

We’ve added a small line to rule 1 to better explain this - and cover a few edge cases that weren’t previously covered:

>Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. **Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule**.
>
>This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).
>
>Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.

We’ve included some additions to the rule and FAQ to cover things that have popped up in the sub and Modmail over time.

- Regardless of where you’re from, some terms are an insult. While we recognize “cunt” is common in the UK or Australia, it is typically an insult elsewhere. As the FAQ states: “You may call your friend a ""cunt"", and I might call my dog ""fuckface"", but when you call a stranger that on the internet, you know you're insulting them.”

- “Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.” This includes stripping someone down to a body part (i.e. “you’re just a hole for him to stick it in” or calling someone a “breeder”).

- Despite what you may see on Tik Tok, Facebook, etc. the rules of this sub always apply here. Those sites often grab content before we’ve had a chance to review it. Those platforms may allow insults, but we do not. 

Rule 1 applies to the comments and not posts. The OP is here asking for judgment. They need to accurately describe how they might have been the asshole in a situation, requiring them to remain civil in their post would be counterproductive. If they called a 10 year old a bitch, they have to be able to tell us they called a 10 year old a bitch. But just because OP called someone a name, or was called a name, doesn’t mean commenters should use the same name. Judge assholes, don’t emulate them. 

We want to be clear. On this sub, civility is about how you talk to and about people. It’s ok to identify shitty behavior. In fact that’s kinda what we’re here for. We’ve all been the asshole at some point - it doesn’t make us bad people. Expect that OP, and their counterpart, are going to read your comment. 

To conclude, we simply want you to play nice. We're not here to roast anyone. Recognize when you're too passionate about a topic to participate. Know when to walk away. Understand some topics will never have consensus and learn to agree to disagree. ***Comment with the goal to give OP actionable feedback on how to improve when they're on the wrong side of a conflict, and to deal with difficult people/situations when they're on the right side.***

680,yjgdh9,AITA for returning my husband's birthday gift to pay for the birthday cake my daughter baked after he refused to pay her?,returning my husbands birthday gift to pay for the birthday cake my daughter baked after he refused to pay her,"

Basically the title. My daughter (16) has a thing for baking, she bakes cakes and some (I said some not all!) sweets and makes money out of it by selling her work to relatives, friends and supposedly us!


My husband's (Her stepdad) 45th birthday took place days ago. He asked my daughter to bake him the birthday cake and she agreed. I told him about paying her to which he responded with ""pfff pay her? Get outta here, I'm her dad!"". I insisted seeing she's ""a yes"" person and a people's pleaser so won't outright demand the money from him. He said he'd pay but days went by and he didn't pay her a cent.


 I decided to go ahead and sell the wrist watch I bought him as his birthday cake and pay her for her. He foubd out and went off on me. I told him he had rnough time and shouldve paid her seven before he recieved the cake. He said that I was teaching her to treat familial relationship as ""transactional"" and raiding her to be ""materialistic"". I explained the time, effort and even money she put towards making the cake but he lashed out verbally calling me an asshlle for making this move and for enabling my daughter to expect so much from family that she's supposed to help with nothing in return.


He's furious and told almost the whole family about how I took back his birthday gift and returned it. I got enough shame from family members to begin to think that I might be an asshole for how I dealt with this.


AITA? Ya'll, my daughter did want and expect to be paid. If she intended for it to be for free then I would have kept my mouth shut. And also the wristwatch idn't expensive. I kept the rest of the money after giving my daughter her share.",basically the title my daughter has a thing for baking she bakes cakes and some i said some not all sweets and makes money out of it by selling her work to relatives friends and supposedly us my husbands her stepdad th birthday took place days ago he asked my daughter to bake him the birthday cake and she agreed i told him about paying her to which he responded with pfff pay her get outta here im her dad i insisted seeing shes a yes person and a peoples pleaser so wont outright demand the money from him he said hed pay but days went by and he didnt pay her a cent i decided to go ahead and sell the wrist watch i bought him as his birthday cake and pay her for her he foubd out and went off on me i told him he had rnough time and shouldve paid her seven before he recieved the cake he said that i was teaching her to treat familial relationship as transactional and raiding her to be materialistic i explained the time effort and even money she put towards making the cake but he lashed out verbally calling me an asshlle for making this move and for enabling my daughter to expect so much from family that shes supposed to help with nothing in return hes furious and told almost the whole family about how i took back his birthday gift and returned it i got enough shame from family members to begin to think that i might be an asshole for how i dealt with this  yall my daughter did want and expect to be paid if she intended for it to be for free then i would have kept my mouth shut and also the wristwatch idnt expensive i kept the rest of the money after giving my daughter her share,316,ESH
682,yjf15c,AITA for punishing my daughter for making us all worried?,punishing my daughter for making us all worried,"My wife and I have a son(17M) together. 16 years ago I was drunk and I slept with another woman which resulted in another child(16F). My wife forgave me but she made it clear that she doesn't want to be anywhere near my daughter. I have my daughter every other weekend and my wife would just go to her parents home every time she is with me.

A few days ago we were going out with my extended family and my daughter was also invited but her mom wasn't invited. She asked me if I could give her a ride and I said yes but when my wife found out she said that while she doesn't have a problem with my daughter being there she doesn't want her to come with us. I tried to change her mind but I couldn't so I asked both my brothers if either of them would bring my daughter with them. They both said yes so I called my daughter and told her I have some problem and asked her to come with one of her uncles and she said it's ok

Well we went there and both my brothers came and my daughter wasn't with either one of them. They both said that my daughter told them she is going with the other one

I called her and her mom and all her friends but no one knew where she is so everyone just left to search for her and after a few hours my son found her. I was so mad at her I yelled at her and told her how she made us all worried. I took away her car(that I bought for her) as a punishment

Her mom has been calling me, saying I'm an asshole and demanding I give her car back

Edit: just to clarify, she didn't drive there because it had a dangerous road and she is not a good driver so I told her she is not allowed to drive there

Edit: ok everyone I got it. I'm the asshole. I gave her car back. it seems like everyone thought I was taking the car forever. I wasn't. It was just supposed to be for a month. I tried to talk to her but she doesn't want to talk however she talked to my son and he told me she was very upset and didn't come because she thought I didn't want her there and the reason she didn't tell us where she was going was, as I guessed, to ruin my day and make me angry. I called her and apologized and told her that we are going out again and promised that she'll come with me this time and she seemed happy about it. I also had a conversation with my wife and told her that as much as I wanted her to come with us if she can't be in the same car as my daughter then she needs to find someone else to give her a ride. She left to her parents home and I'm not sure what she is gonna do",my wife and i have a sonm together years ago i was drunk and i slept with another woman which resulted in another childf my wife forgave me but she made it clear that she doesnt want to be anywhere near my daughter i have my daughter every other weekend and my wife would just go to her parents home every time she is with me a few days ago we were going out with my extended family and my daughter was also invited but her mom wasnt invited she asked me if i could give her a ride and i said yes but when my wife found out she said that while she doesnt have a problem with my daughter being there she doesnt want her to come with us i tried to change her mind but i couldnt so i asked both my brothers if either of them would bring my daughter with them they both said yes so i called my daughter and told her i have some problem and asked her to come with one of her uncles and she said its ok well we went there and both my brothers came and my daughter wasnt with either one of them they both said that my daughter told them she is going with the other one i called her and her mom and all her friends but no one knew where she is so everyone just left to search for her and after a few hours my son found her i was so mad at her i yelled at her and told her how she made us all worried i took away her carthat i bought for her as a punishment her mom has been calling me saying im an asshole and demanding i give her car back edit just to clarify she didnt drive there because it had a dangerous road and she is not a good driver so i told her she is not allowed to drive there edit ok everyone i got it im the asshole i gave her car back it seems like everyone thought i was taking the car forever i wasnt it was just supposed to be for a month i tried to talk to her but she doesnt want to talk however she talked to my son and he told me she was very upset and didnt come because she thought i didnt want her there and the reason she didnt tell us where she was going was as i guessed to ruin my day and make me angry i called her and apologized and told her that we are going out again and promised that shell come with me this time and she seemed happy about it i also had a conversation with my wife and told her that as much as i wanted her to come with us if she cant be in the same car as my daughter then she needs to find someone else to give her a ride she left to her parents home and im not sure what she is gonna do,519,YTA
683,yjqlvt,AITA for making my in laws leave?,making my in laws leave,"This is important for context: my husband and I have a very strict rule of if you don't call, or text us before you come over you're made to leave. This has been a fact since we got married and had kids. This applys to both sides of the family. 

So today around 4:30, I hear a knock at the door and it turns out it's my in-laws. My husband isn't home at this point so I quickly call him to see if they'd talked to him about coming over. He says no they hadn't. I check my messages and missed calls and voicemail. They didn't call or next me either. I answer the door and ask them what they needed 

They ask to see our daughter who isn't even home. She's at my mom's house visiting for the week since my husband and I are in that process of closing on a house and moving out of our rental home.  So we are not in any shape to receive guests. 

I ask them if they called or texted my husband or myself and they admit they had hadn't but they didn't see the issue since I was home. I remind them of our rule and tell them they need to leave. My FIL gets huffy saying they drove over an hour to see our daughter and they should be allowed in. 

I explained that I understand that but since they didn't check with us first they needed to leave. I go to close the door and my MIL puts her foot in the way to prevent the door from closing. At this point I'm getting extremely frustrated as I have other things I need to take care of. 

My MIL explains that since it was such a long drive they should at least be let in for a few minutes to visit. At this point my husband comes home and my in laws are under the impression my husband will let them in. He doesn't. He tells them to leave and at this point they're trespassing. 

We have a no trespassing sign on a tree by the house. It's clearly visible. My husband reminds them of our rule and tells them to leave. They refuse. My husband then tells them he has no choice but to call the police and have them removed from the property. 

My in-laws think he's bluffing but my husband isn't a bluffer. He calls the sheriff and has his parents removed from the property. His parents are extremely upset saying we're assholes for not letting them break the rule. I do honestly feel a little bad since they did drive an hour to see our daughter.

685,yja4yx,AITA for saying someone is short and fat?,saying someone is short and fat,"A girl (18F) at my school is a fat positivity activist on TikTok. She films herself eating, twerking, and making the fat on her butt jiggle for the camera while saying how in love with her body she is.
She also says all the time that being fat is an honor and beautiful. This is important for later on.

For a public speaking assignment in class, she wrote about how modeling should be illegal because the models in fashion week are skinny and tall, and they look like freaks and not like normal girls. And they make everyone feel uncomfortable watching them. The whole assignment was about speaking calmly and effectively, but she was speaking very angrily and aggressively.

I’m pretty sure her whole speech was just directed at me because it’s known at school that I walk in fashion week, and she was weirdly staring me down during the speech.

For the audience counter argument part, the teacher then asked me what I thought of the arguments since I walk in fashion week. I said I thought it was all pretty ridiculous, of course.

The girl and her girls came up to me and my friends at lunch and said that I’m eating fruit salad because of I have disordered eating, which I don’t. She then said “You’re only allowed to walk because you’re tall and skinny, just so you know” in a derogatory way. I said “And you’re not allowed to because you’re short and fat. What’s your point?”

She yelled “And the mask is off. I was just waiting for you to show your bigotry and insult me.”

However, if being fat is an honor and beautiful as she always says, I don’t see how stating she’s fat is an insult or bigoted. I would be pissed if someone called me fat, but that’s because I don’t see it as an honor, and she supposedly does.",a girl f at my school is a fat positivity activist on tiktok she films herself eating twerking and making the fat on her butt jiggle for the camera while saying how in love with her body she is she also says all the time that being fat is an honor and beautiful this is important for later on for a public speaking assignment in class she wrote about how modeling should be illegal because the models in fashion week are skinny and tall and they look like freaks and not like normal girls and they make everyone feel uncomfortable watching them the whole assignment was about speaking calmly and effectively but she was speaking very angrily and aggressively i’m pretty sure her whole speech was just directed at me because it’s known at school that i walk in fashion week and she was weirdly staring me down during the speech for the audience counter argument part the teacher then asked me what i thought of the arguments since i walk in fashion week i said i thought it was all pretty ridiculous of course the girl and her girls came up to me and my friends at lunch and said that i’m eating fruit salad because of i have disordered eating which i don’t she then said “you’re only allowed to walk because you’re tall and skinny just so you know” in a derogatory way i said “and you’re not allowed to because you’re short and fat what’s your point” she yelled “and the mask is off i was just waiting for you to show your bigotry and insult me” however if being fat is an honor and beautiful as she always says i don’t see how stating she’s fat is an insult or bigoted i would be pissed if someone called me fat but that’s because i don’t see it as an honor and she supposedly does,319,ESH
686,yj6204,AITA for financially contributing more to one child's life?,financially contributing more to one childs life,"We have two kids, Ava (35f) and Heather (33f). We have a great relationship with both kids.

About 12 years ago, Ava got engaged to her now husband. We bought them a house in our neighborhood and then the next year paid for their wedding.

Heather has lived in a few different cities, taken different college programs, etc. She seems content to keep exploring where her happy is, and I think that's great.

About 10 years ago, different plots of land came for sale in our neighborhood, We asked Heather which she wanted. She thanked us for the thought, but said that she didn't know where she wanted to be and that we shouldn't buy land for her. We ended up buying a plot of land near us. We told her, she again thanked us but never made use of the land.

Fast forward to now, Heather approaches us, clearly nervous, and respectfully asked if we would be able to help her with a down payment for a house in the city where she lives. She was clear she understood if that was not possible.

This has caused an argument between myself (56f) and my wife (60f). I would love to help Heather, but honestly we are in very different financial circumstances now then we were before. We are hoping to retire soon, and do not have a lot of excess money.

My wife thinks that Heather does not ask for much and that we have clearly helped one child significantly more than the other. (Ava's wedding cost tens of thousands of dollars and the house was obviously hundreds of thousands). She thinks we should sacrifice whatever we can to help Heather. To be clear, we have financially helped Heather over the years, helped with decorations when she's moved, with furniture, etc. (I know it's not the same, but I want to be clear we are involved in both kids lives). I also know that Heather would be uncomfortable if she knew us contributing to her house was impacting our retirement.

I think if we talk to Heather openly about the difference in our financial circumstances now and then, she would understand.

My wife wants to sell the piece of land in our neighborhood to give Heather the money. I really don't want to do that. For a few reasons. Including that I think Heather would regret that in the future because she has mentioned once or twice over the years that she will want to move back home when she's older. Prices for land here have gone up significantly. To be frank, nobody in our family could ever afford to buy here now or in future.

AITA for not being able to give Heather the down payment?

I have been told I can edit. To provide more clarity Mel and I are both women, that seemed to cause some confusion in the comments.

I just want to say that Mel and I love both girls more than we can say. We didn't plan, and the fact that there are so many of you saying that Heather will think we value her less is our biggest fear here. Heather is a wonderful independent, kind and loving person. She deserved and deserves better from us. Obviously.

I am not comfortable getting too specific but over the years there have been some unexpected health issues arise, with my parents and then Ava's kids that have depleted our funds more than we expected. But bottom line, that's something we should have taken into account when giving Ava so much.

There have been many suggestions here that have been helpful so I thank you for that, and for the reality check about selling the land and letting Heather make her own choices.

Heather is a person who is incredibly sensitive and kind. Most often to her own detriment. To a point where I think she knows we would prefer her to live near us and may not accept the sale of the land because of it. To be clear I am absolutely open to the sale of the land or transferring it to Heather now, it's just how to best approach it so that Heather doesn't feel guilt going forward.

You've given us a lot to think about and we're going to try to move forward as best we can to make sure Heather knows she is loved and valued (some suggestions regarding our will were helpful in this regard).

I'm not sure what else to say other than thank you for taking the time to comment. We are going to do our best to improve going forward.",we have two kids ava f and heather f we have a great relationship with both kids about years ago ava got engaged to her now husband we bought them a house in our neighborhood and then the next year paid for their wedding heather has lived in a few different cities taken different college programs etc she seems content to keep exploring where her happy is and i think thats great about years ago different plots of land came for sale in our neighborhood we asked heather which she wanted she thanked us for the thought but said that she didnt know where she wanted to be and that we shouldnt buy land for her we ended up buying a plot of land near us we told her she again thanked us but never made use of the land fast forward to now heather approaches us clearly nervous and respectfully asked if we would be able to help her with a down payment for a house in the city where she lives she was clear she understood if that was not possible this has caused an argument between myself f and my wife f i would love to help heather but honestly we are in very different financial circumstances now then we were before we are hoping to retire soon and do not have a lot of excess money my wife thinks that heather does not ask for much and that we have clearly helped one child significantly more than the other avas wedding cost tens of thousands of dollars and the house was obviously hundreds of thousands she thinks we should sacrifice whatever we can to help heather to be clear we have financially helped heather over the years helped with decorations when shes moved with furniture etc i know its not the same but i want to be clear we are involved in both kids lives i also know that heather would be uncomfortable if she knew us contributing to her house was impacting our retirement i think if we talk to heather openly about the difference in our financial circumstances now and then she would understand my wife wants to sell the piece of land in our neighborhood to give heather the money i really dont want to do that for a few reasons including that i think heather would regret that in the future because she has mentioned once or twice over the years that she will want to move back home when shes older prices for land here have gone up significantly to be frank nobody in our family could ever afford to buy here now or in future  for not being able to give heather the down payment i have been told i can edit to provide more clarity mel and i are both women that seemed to cause some confusion in the comments i just want to say that mel and i love both girls more than we can say we didnt plan and the fact that there are so many of you saying that heather will think we value her less is our biggest fear here heather is a wonderful independent kind and loving person she deserved and deserves better from us obviously i am not comfortable getting too specific but over the years there have been some unexpected health issues arise with my parents and then avas kids that have depleted our funds more than we expected but bottom line thats something we should have taken into account when giving ava so much there have been many suggestions here that have been helpful so i thank you for that and for the reality check about selling the land and letting heather make her own choices heather is a person who is incredibly sensitive and kind most often to her own detriment to a point where i think she knows we would prefer her to live near us and may not accept the sale of the land because of it to be clear i am absolutely open to the sale of the land or transferring it to heather now its just how to best approach it so that heather doesnt feel guilt going forward youve given us a lot to think about and were going to try to move forward as best we can to make sure heather knows she is loved and valued some suggestions regarding our will were helpful in this regard im not sure what else to say other than thank you for taking the time to comment we are going to do our best to improve going forward,772,YTA
690,yjr6x0,AITA for not wanting to split 50/50,not wanting to split,"I (F26) have been seeing my boyfriend (M28) for a few years now. He owns the apartment he lives in while I’m finishing uni this semester and will start making a decent salary from January. He has wanted me to move in for a while now, which I would be excited to do, but we have some differences in opinions that we have a hard time settling on.

He wants to split costs (his monthly mortgage downpayments plus bills and groceries etc) 50/50 as we will be making around the same amount. I don’t agree with this as it is his apartment, and by default I will be paying down his mortgage and will be left with nothing if we break up, while he will have his house and interest from its rise in value. I proposed that I can pay 50/50 of all expenses as well as half of the interest rate, but not contribute to the mortgage payment of his loan. This way I can put the rest of money into savings so when my savings are big enough we can go in on an apartment together that will be in interest for the both of us (or I can buy a share into his existing apartment).

He thinks it’s unreasonable that we wouldn’t pay the same monthly expenses when we both make the same and that I am focusing too much on what is mine and what is his. He has made small digs, hinting that I am trying to leech off of his investments by getting a cheaper place to live – which I don’t think is the case. I find that splitting everything 50/50 disproportionately advantages him and basically results in me paying down a loan that I have no interest in.
AITA?

EDIT: first of all thank you so much for all the response! It’s really interesting to see how people see things so differently. Here are a few clarifications on some things that are brought up in the comments
- I will not be having “free rent”, the interest rate is quite significant as well as fees related to the apartment complex plus insurances etc. It is only the actual mortgage portion (aka the equity part) that is a matter of dispute. His expenses will be significantly lower if I move in than him living by himself as he is currently
- I am not currently homeless and living in a flat with three friends where I don’t mind to continue living
- For everyone saying I would be paying down a landlords mortgage regardless, that is true, but our relationship is not a landlord-tenant relationship where the goal is for the landlord to profit off of its tenants. And this might be me that is being absolutely too stubborn - but yes, I would rather want to pay the mortgage of a landlord than have my boyfriend actively profiting off of me. Because that would be a formal agreement with more stability, and it would be within its nature to be profitable for one party. It doesn’t sit right with me that our living situation would be an agreement that my boyfriend would profit off of.

Another clarification:
- half of the expenses are still more than what I am paying in my current living situation

Additional clarification:
- he is not willing to enter an agreement where my rent goes into equity so I can gradually buy my way into the house
- there still seem to be a lot of confusion about the «free rent » part, and I don’t think people realize how much of your monthly expenses are tied to interests and other costs such as insurance and fees connected to the complex. What I’m proposing is about 40/60, it is only the principal payment of the loan which is of dispute - which is the direct payment of his loan that is increasing his equity

Small edit: removed the part about what it would cost to live alone as it seemed to be confusing people. Living with my current roommates in our flat for a lower rent is the alternative option. Sorry about any confusion.

Update: We have concluded that we will not live together as of now, and I will continue to stay in my flat until I have saved up enough to where we can look into buying a place together. We have also set up a session with our bank to get some further advice. As questions of finances often are, it is much more about on agreeing on how finances should be dealt with in the long run than the actual dollar amount. I do believe it is important to have these conversations early on and stand your ground where you think it is right to avoid further disputes in the future. My goal is to save up money to buy a shared apartment as soon as possible, so it is ultimately better to stay put and have a lower rent with my friends. Things would obviously be less complicated if we were renting and collectively saving up for a down payment for our first home together, but that is not the situation we´re in. Buying a property is an important financial priority of mine and he is not in on parts of the rent going into equity, so we will leave it for now.

Thank you for all the input and proposals for different solutions! Again, very interesting to see how everyone´s take is so different on this, and a lot to take in for the future. There is room for more flexibility, although 50/50 without any equity or any other supplementary agreement is not going to work for me:) (and is something I would advise anyone to be cautious of going into any long-term living agreement with a partner)

692,yjfyhn,Update: AITA for leaving my friend at a party because she insulted me?,update  leaving my friend at a party because she insulted me,"Hello everyone, I've received a few requests asking for an update on my situation and I did promise one so here I am.

To begin with, I feel bad for leaving her at the party. I shouldn't have done that, like everyone here said, I should have just offered her a ride, found her another ride, or told her I was leaving. I was so embarrassed and angry that I just didn't want to be around her anymore so I left quietly. Thanks to a kind redditor, I believe I may have some self-esteem and anger issues I need to work out, so I have scheduled a meeting with my campus counselor, and maybe get some professional therapy after that.

Now on Friday afternoon I texted my friend Tina to talk so we can finally clear the air. She agreed and we met at her dorm. I apologized for leaving her at the party and not telling her I was leaving. She said that she is still pretty mad about leaving her in an unsafe situation when she was drunk. I told her I was upset at what I felt was her perceived revulsion. She apologized and said that she shouldn't have made me feel so unattractive. She said that because I'm like her brother, she would never find me attractive, but that doesn't mean other girls don't. I told her that I don't care if she did find me attractive, I was just upset with the tone. She said she understood, after I left one of our friends told her that she kinda went overboard with it and she really regretted how she said it. She apologized again, and I apologized again for leaving her. We admitted that we're not super happy with each other at the moment and are going to take some time apart to sort out our feelings(not romantic) toward each other. If we run into each other we're not gonna be awkward, and we might even text. But no hanging out like we were before.

And that's it. Not a particularly happy update, but I guess it's better than nothing right? Thanks to all the redditors who helped me through this little mini-saga. I guess I'll see you all in therapy.",hello everyone ive received a few requests asking for an update on my situation and i did promise one so here i am to begin with i feel bad for leaving her at the party i shouldnt have done that like everyone here said i should have just offered her a ride found her another ride or told her i was leaving i was so embarrassed and angry that i just didnt want to be around her anymore so i left quietly thanks to a kind redditor i believe i may have some selfesteem and anger issues i need to work out so i have scheduled a meeting with my campus counselor and maybe get some professional therapy after that now on friday afternoon i texted my friend tina to talk so we can finally clear the air she agreed and we met at her dorm i apologized for leaving her at the party and not telling her i was leaving she said that she is still pretty mad about leaving her in an unsafe situation when she was drunk i told her i was upset at what i felt was her perceived revulsion she apologized and said that she shouldnt have made me feel so unattractive she said that because im like her brother she would never find me attractive but that doesnt mean other girls dont i told her that i dont care if she did find me attractive i was just upset with the tone she said she understood after i left one of our friends told her that she kinda went overboard with it and she really regretted how she said it she apologized again and i apologized again for leaving her we admitted that were not super happy with each other at the moment and are going to take some time apart to sort out our feelingsnot romantic toward each other if we run into each other were not gonna be awkward and we might even text but no hanging out like we were before and thats it not a particularly happy update but i guess its better than nothing right thanks to all the redditors who helped me through this little minisaga i guess ill see you all in therapy,376,YTA
693,yjs1ek,AITA for telling my coworker’s wife nobody knew about her?,telling my coworker’s wife nobody knew about her,"I’ve (26M) been working at my job for a little over 4 years. During Covid Theo (25ish M) joined our crew. In the 2 years we have known him, he has NEVER mentioned a spouse. He’s talked about friends and family, his favorite things, what he’s cooking for dinner, everything but that and kind of made himself sound single. A couple of coworkers even asked him out but he declined because he doesn’t date coworkers. I can’t deny he’s VERY good looking which attracted a lot of interest from coworkers.

A few weeks ago, I was walking home from grocery shopping near work and my bag split. A woman help pick up everything and even offered her tote. We chatted and it turns out she was Theo’s WIFE. They had been married for 3 years so before he even started this job. When I introduced myself as Theo’s coworker, it was clear Theo had told her about work and us but I don’t think she realized that we didn’t know she even existed.

When I went to work, I casually asked Theo if he was seeing anyone and he shrugged and said work was too busy. I thought it was weird he wouldn’t mention his wife so I messaged her and said we needed to talk.

We met later at a cafe and I told her that no one knew who she was because Theo never mentioned her. I talked about how women would flirt with him. I mentioned he never wore a wedding ring. She started blinking hard as if trying not to cry. She looked crushed. But she was a sweetheart and paid for my coffee before I even got a chance to.

The past few days Theo has been very moody. He started buying lunch instead of bringing one from home. He’s been ignoring me which interferes in our work. He cornered me today after work and told me that his wife was sad and he didn’t know why but it was my fault. He told me to never contact his wife or talk about her again. I told my coworkers what happened and everyone expressed shock that he had a wife. A few coworkers said I was an asshole for telling my coworker’s wife that he hid her existence but most took my side. My boyfriend said I was in the right and people would want to know if their spouse was acting shady like Theo.

Edit: is it not normal to chat with people evenif its strangers? I grew up in a small town and we talked with everybody. Wasn’t unusual to see your teacher at a bowling alley or your mechanic at the bar.",i’ve m been working at my job for a little over years during covid theo ish m joined our crew in the years we have known him he has never mentioned a spouse he’s talked about friends and family his favorite things what he’s cooking for dinner everything but that and kind of made himself sound single a couple of coworkers even asked him out but he declined because he doesn’t date coworkers i can’t deny he’s very good looking which attracted a lot of interest from coworkers a few weeks ago i was walking home from grocery shopping near work and my bag split a woman help pick up everything and even offered her tote we chatted and it turns out she was theo’s wife they had been married for years so before he even started this job when i introduced myself as theo’s coworker it was clear theo had told her about work and us but i don’t think she realized that we didn’t know she even existed when i went to work i casually asked theo if he was seeing anyone and he shrugged and said work was too busy i thought it was weird he wouldn’t mention his wife so i messaged her and said we needed to talk we met later at a cafe and i told her that no one knew who she was because theo never mentioned her i talked about how women would flirt with him i mentioned he never wore a wedding ring she started blinking hard as if trying not to cry she looked crushed but she was a sweetheart and paid for my coffee before i even got a chance to the past few days theo has been very moody he started buying lunch instead of bringing one from home he’s been ignoring me which interferes in our work he cornered me today after work and told me that his wife was sad and he didn’t know why but it was my fault he told me to never contact his wife or talk about her again i told my coworkers what happened and everyone expressed shock that he had a wife a few coworkers said i was an asshole for telling my coworker’s wife that he hid her existence but most took my side my boyfriend said i was in the right and people would want to know if their spouse was acting shady like theo edit is it not normal to chat with people evenif its strangers i grew up in a small town and we talked with everybody wasn’t unusual to see your teacher at a bowling alley or your mechanic at the bar,447,YTA
694,yjf29b,AITA for threatening to call the landlord if my roommate allows a guest to stay at our apartment?,threatening to call the landlord if my roommate allows a guest to stay at our apartment,"I (20F) have a roommate (24M) and we split rent 50/50 for a two bed apartment. We get along pretty well and have never had any problems. 

As part of our renters agreement with the landlord, we're only allowed one guest over at a time for a week max with the consent of the other roommate. So if I want to have a friend stay with me for a few days, my roommate has to agree and vice versa. We both have had friends over before and it's always gone over peacefully. We both also have had more than one friend over with no issues because we respected eachother's space and belongings. It's important to note here that I've only ever invited over other women, and he's only ever invited over other men. Our guests also stay in our own bedrooms.


Three weeks ago, one of my friends, Mike (22M) needed a place to stay for three days because he was leaving an abusive partner. I asked my roommate if it was alright to have him over for those three days. I explained the sensitivity of the situation and I promised, as always, to cover any extra expenses caused by Mike being over. My roommate refused because he said he didn't feel comfortable with a man being invited over. I had no clue what he was talking about it and I was very annoyed, but I respected his choice. My friends and I put money together to get Mike a hotel room for those three days instead. 


Today, my roommate asked if he could have two friends over for Friday and the Weekend. I said no because it was against the renters rules. He was confused because we've both agreed to break the rules before, but I said to him that I didn't feel comfortable with two strange men over. He could tell straight away that I was doing it to annoy him because he didn't let Mike stay over, plus I have met the friends he was inviting over before. He told me to stop being childish because he has a right to refuse guests for being uncomfortable whereas I was doing it to be annoying. What's even more irritating is that he has met Mike before and they get along with eachother. He then said he'd invite them over anyway but I said I'd call the landlord if he did so. We got into an argument and he called me an asshole for threatening to call the landlord over this. I still don't think I'm wrong because I am allowed (in the agreement) to refuse guests for any reason but i would like an objective opinion.

696,yjb1t7,AITA for not introducing husbands biological daughter to her biological siblings?,not introducing husbands biological daughter to her biological siblings,"So before my husband and I ever met, he had a brief fling with a woman from work and she ended up pregnant.

Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship. My children were also very young when my husband died with my youngest two having pretty much no memories of him and my oldest very few and we have spent many years moving on with our lives (yes I know that sounds horrible).

698,yj89zl,AITA because I won't buy my MIL a carseat?,because i wont buy my mil a carseat,"My husband (m30) and I (f28) have a son(m19months). He goes to daycare 3 days a week and usually gets picked up by my grandma (f78). She is his main caregiver when we are both working. She purchased a carseat, with my help, so that she could pick him up and to have for emergencies. My MIL (f63) does not watch my son often. She has stated many times she does not want to have baby things in her car or house. She is our last resort when it comes to babysitting. 

Yesterday I needed MIL to watch my son after daycare because my grandma had doctor appointments. I asked MIL two weeks in advance so that I didn't interfere with her schedule. Grandma offered up her carseat because MIL does not have one. MIL was supposed to leave carseat at my house so I could give it back to grandma. She refuses to learn how to put the carseat in her car. She makes my husband or me take it in and out. So she did not return the carseat to grandma. This morning I had to leave my carseat at daycare so grandma could pick up my son.

I asked my husband to please talk to MIL about getting a carseat because we are playing musical cars and it's not fair that she kept grandma's carseat that grandma paid for. Husband wants me to send the type of carseat to him so he can buy it for MIL. I refused saying she can spend her own money and do her own research on the carseat. (Obviously I would make sure it was a safe model before I let her take my son). He says I'm being unreasonable and all I have to do is send the model and he'll take care of it. Am I the Asshole because I won't help her get a carseat?


This is a petty edit: but to go along with her not wanting to do baby things. She refuses to give my son Tylenol when he has an ear infection because he ""will ruin his kidneys"". And won't follow guidelines I give her as far as food. Yes I should not have her babysit but when it comes down to me calling off of work or her picking him up from daycare, I would hope she could be a decent person and do me a favor. I may be entitled by asking her to buy a carseat but I didn't want to bog down this post with personal feelings.

Final edit: I get it, IATAH because I won't buy the seat. However thanks to your comments we will be re-evaluating how much we use MIL as a pick up/drop off person (even if it is only 5 times a year). In the end this was the straw that broke the camel's back in my dealings with MIL. While it's a weird hill to die on it was my breaking point, but not the best one.

When I got home my mom asked if I had fun and if I got alot of candy, which I did and she said that she was glad and that I should go change into pajamas so we could watch scary movies while we go through the candy and pick out the good stuff and give the gross stuff to dad. When we watched the movie she dumped my bag on the table and I got mad because she was throwing out the stuff that looked like it mightve been opened or something.
I ask why she was throwing out my candy and her excuse was this the candies were opened and it was a new neighborhood and we don't know anyone here yet. I told her so what it's just candy from neighbors and she said it might have been tampered with  so I told her that just because people put blades in apples back in her day doesn't mean she should take it out on me, and that's not a thing that happens anymore and she needs to stop worrying.

721,yjrwpg,AITA for throwing my children's Halloween candy out without explaining ahead of time why?,throwing my childrens halloween candy out without explaining ahead of time why,"I (55M) took my two kids (6M, 4F) out for their first trick-or-treat session Monday night (previous 2 years were off-limits due to COVID, and prior to that one/both were too young). 

They were very excited about finally being able to go enjoy the holiday, and put a lot of effort into their costumes given their age. I told them prior to heading out that this was a fun tradition where kids go door-to-door in costume and are given gifts. I said “gifts” because a good portion of my Halloween hauls growing up were non-candy items: toys, spare change, comic books, etc.

I’m also really not a fan of candy in general – I dealt with major weight issues prior to meeting my wife (40F) and did irrevocable damage to my teeth in my younger years because my parents didn’t set a limit on my candy, Halloween or otherwise. I believe the US confectionary industry pushes this holiday to get kids hooked on sugar and want to protect my children from getting tangled up in that – they get dental cleanings three times a year even though our insurance only covers the first two. My wife agrees with this approach in general, and when she makes dessert it’s usually a low/zero-sugar affair. She grew up in Poland and has no childhood experiences related to Halloween proper.

After we got home from trick-or-treating, my daughter was exhausted and had to be carried up to her bed by my wife after passing out on the couch. I went to the bathroom to freshen up and came out to my son wolfing down candy – there were 5 or so empty wrappers already on the floor. I don’t know where he got the idea to eat them, as we have NEVER had candy at home – I guess he may have gotten some at school (he started 1st grade back in August). 

I scolded him on how unhealthy it is to pig out like that, took his bucket away from him, filtered out the non-candy, and dumped the sweets in the trash before telling him he needed to clean up the wrappers he left on the floor. He whined “NO” back and stomped off upstairs. I cleaned up the wrappers and threw out the candy from my daughter’s bucket. She was surprised today that she had a lot fewer “toys” than she did last night but has been way less sulky than my son. 

My wife came downstairs after putting our daughter to bed and was wondering why our son was in such a bad mood, so I explained. She’s not opposed to me drawing a hard line on sugar like that but said I probably should have told them ahead of time about what candy is and why we won’t be holding on to it, instead of assuming both were oblivious. I’m debating just not taking them trick-or-treating in future years, but they both seemed to really enjoy their costumes and their baskets weren’t full of just candy. I’m also debating mentioning this to my son’s teacher and asking if she gives students in her classroom candy, but my wife thinks that’s a bridge too far.

We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :

“i have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.”

I was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)

I guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me. I often mimic people’s personality and humor to fit with them, so after we had been friends for so long we were practically the same person. everyone said that, even our moms.

She has pets and is struggling to find pet care, stating it's due to the holiday weekend. She said her friends who often watch her pets are out of town and that a lot of the pet sitting services are increasing fees for the holiday. She can't bring her dogs to the wedding bc my dog doesn't get along with dogs.

She is refusing to wear a costume, stating it will be too much to navigate on the train. She likely will not bring a dish, either.

758,yjusjc,AITA for telling my friend that a 50/50 split isn't fair?,telling my friend that a split isnt fair," Recently, my husband (30M) and I (27F) were having dinner with my friend Kim (27F) and her husband Aiden (28M). Kim and I have known each other since college and are really close. Kim and her husband have been together for over 3 years. They met at work when they were both working as graphic designers. Kim no longer works in graphic design and graduated about a year ago with a masters in a different field.

So at dinner, Aiden brought up a podcast he listened to talking about a girl who signed a car lease for her new boyfriend. This lead to us discussing how we split finances in our own relationships. My husband and I split expenses based on income, we also have joint and separate accounts. My husband makes 10k more than me, so he pays a greater percentage of our expenses. Aiden brought up that he and Kim split expenses 50/50.

I was a little surprised because Kim makes significantly more then he does after her career change. By significant, she has told me she makes 115k which is 45k more than her husband. When I questioned why they split 50/50 instead of proportionally based on income, Kim gave me a nasty look. But I pushed the question a little more and Kim erupted saying that their finances were none of my business. 

I was taken aback because I didn't expect this topic to be a sore spot and Kim and I both talk a lot about demolishing traditional gender roles. I pointed out that it probably wasn't super fair to be splitting 50/50 when you make a lot more than your partner. Now Kim is mad at me and my husband says that I should have just kept quiet to keep the peace.

781,yk464j,WIBTA for actively trying to prevent my neighbors from parking in front of my home?,wibta for actively trying to prevent my neighbors from parking in front of my home,"Throwaway, because I just don't want this to be tied to my main. We (f26), me and my boyfriend (m23) have recently moved into a nice home located on a riverside. We have no neighbors in front of us, only to the side and behind. Our neighbors to our right live in a Triplex, three families one roof. A few weeks ago, one of the neighbors friend started to park in front of our house. We didn't know it was them until my BF, who knows one of the girls living in the triplex, asked them if they knew who this unknown large black truck belonged to. I didn't think much of it until the car was parked there every day after. The BF asked them to move their vehicle upon my request. It was becoming an eyesore, and frankly I find it rude that they're parking in front of our home in the first place. 

They moved the large truck, to only be replaced a few days later by two sedans now taking up the entirety of our front. One is even blocking our mailbox now. My BF said due to property easement, I can't even legally make them move. He originally (back with the black truck) told them that they can park in front of our recycling bin off to the side of our property. They would basically be parked half on our side half on theirs under one of the electrical posts. They moved our recycling bin forward, now near the post, and are parking behind it right in front of our doorway with the other behind.

At this point I'm getting mad, and I've even thought about saying, ""fuck it"" and going out to buy a bunch of bushes and plants and planting them on the property line so they can't park there anymore. My BF has already asked them not to park there, but he said that if they're choosing to ignore him it's out of his hands. He also doesn't understand why I'm getting so worked up about it, says I'm being dumb.

I live in a major city and use public transportation but they have agreed to leave us the car for easy travel. This is fantastic since I will be staying at their place and it's not in the city and public transportation is not available in their area.
Here's my delima: they did not tell me that we were watching the kids until 1 week before they leave. My manager just so happens to be out of the office for the same week I'm watching the kids. Because of this,I cannot make adjustments to my schedule. The one child has to be at school at 6am (long before the school busses start running) for an advanced band he's in. I cannot reasonably take him to this practice and get to work on time. WIBTA if I told them he has to miss that week of practice or they have to find him other transportation to school on those days?

I thought that was silly. He demanded that I take it down but I declined. He insisted saying he was ""technically"" recordered via my camera and he did not consent. I called him ridiculous and refused to take it down. He's gotten the kids involved now which got me mad and made the argument escalate.

793,ykhau0,AITA for waking up my roommate by talking on the phone at night?,waking up my roommate by talking on the phone at night,"My friend and I rented a room together for our first semester of college. I moved from a different city and we're going to a school in his home city. There was a friend I left behind when I moved out of college who has mental issues and was dependent on me for support. She was distraught that I was moving, but I made a promise to her that I would always be available to talk to any time of the day or night. Because of this I never put my phone on silent.

She calls a lot late at night because of her schedule, that's when she's able to talk. I don't mind so much because I'm a night person and have insomnia. My friend/roommate however has started complaining that it wakes him up and asks if I could put my phone on silent at night. I said no. I go out of my way to talk quietly on the phone, but he says the ringing wakes him up and me talking keeps him awake, sometimes for a long time. I suggested ear plugs or headphones and he seemed pissed.

To make matters worse my friend seems like he's starting to resent me and her for it. She was talking about moving here and I asked my friend if he could ask our apartment complex if we have any open rooms. He said no and said that from what he's heard he doesn't like her and thinks she's manipulative. This pissed me off. He shouldn't be saying that, and how hard would it be for him to do a simple thing like that and help me out. Isn't he supposed to be my friend? I would do it for him.

I'm a person of my word and don't want to break this promise to her. Frankly I've known her longer and her well being is a priority to me. I don't get why it would be so hard for him to get earplugs or something. I'm paying for the bedroom too and I have a right to use it as my space. I think her well being is more important than the inconvenience of my roommate having to wear earplugs or something.

I’m a huge Simpsons fan and in any early episode Moe makes a joke “hi my name is Moe, or as women call me ‘who’s that hiding in the bushes?’”

My parents had their 40th wedding anniversary this weekend and my older sister organized a party and insisted that she, me and my brother give toasts. I wanted no part of it but we always do what she says so I tried to make mine funny.


Roughly what I said was “my parents have 3 kids, Toni or as call her “red card.” I’m the middle child, I don’t get a nickname in fact I don’t think my parents even know my real name and then of course Aiden who all the girls in the neighborhood called ‘who’s that in the bushes?” 

I thought it was funny but amongst the 60 year olds—it was dead silence. But two of their oldest friends got up and started to walk out. My sister tried to gloss over by having a toast. My mom did her toast then went after her friends, my dad followed my mom. They came back five minutes later very upset.

They have a daughter aged between me and my brother. I guess one night when he was 14 he rode his bike 12 miles across town and did what I joked about. Nothing physical happened but I guess it was never fully rectified between my family and theirs and they thought I was making light of something that was traumatic for their family.

I truly did not know as my parents always hid my brothers “escapades” from us.

Sister and parents are furious with me and refuse to believe I didn’t know and made joke on purpose. My brother is back on the road van lifing so we won’t see him for a year or so when all will be forgotten.

807,ykdtzx,AITA for telling my husband what I think he should do with a car he inherited from a family member who passed?,telling my husband what i think he should do with a car he inherited from a family member who passed,"My husband and I are in our late 40s and got married a little before covid. This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. 

On with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). 

Here is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. 

My husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. 

I’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. 

He even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?

My parents’ holiday parties are pretty extravagant and beyond family, only a select few get invites. This includes close friends and neighbors. My siblings and I can make suggestions but it’s our parents’ party at the end of the day, which means their decisions are final. My parents also happen to be notoriously hard to impress.

A few of my friends have made the invite list for the party before, but slowly as I’ve gotten older and lost touch with people, that list has dwindled down to just my longtime best friend and former roommate, Jordan (32m). We grew up in the same neighborhood and he even worked at my dad’s company for the majority of his 20s. While he’s my friend first and foremost, he’s clearly also a friend of the family. My parents love him and have since we met when I was 15 and he was 19. 

I got engaged in September after dating my fiancée (29f) for around a year and a half. She wasn’t put on the guest list last year and she didn’t see it as a problem since she was busy with her own family festivities. I hadn’t really put much thought into what might happen this year besides a brief mention to my parents about adding her sometime last month. 

As always, my parents email my siblings and I the final guest list on November 1st in order for us to look over it and give our thoughts as they finalize final numbers in preparation to send out invitations and RSVPs. As I looked over it this morning, I noticed my fiancée's name wasn’t on there. An important note is that the party isn’t the only Christmas celebration had. I also stay with my family on Christmas night in order to open presents the next morning, and all significant others are invited to that. I told this to my fiancée and she was livid. She said it was beyond disrespectful that Jordan got an invite but she didn’t, and that I needed to stand up to my parents. I told her it was their party, and they had the final say but that Christmas festivities would still happen - this just gave her time with her own family again.

AITA?

ETA: After texting them for a reason she was left out, my mom told me that multiple people had expressed distaste for her in the past and that she was trying to minimize the amount of negativity/drama as much as she could. If I had to guess, I know who these people are - my sister and Jordan - who have both had slightly unpleasant interactions with my fiancée in the past where she claimed they were both stuck up.

for those who didn’t see the previous post:

For context: there was a storm here last night, my best friend lives with his pregnant fiancé in the next town over, I was given the key to their house in case of an emergency when she got pregnant because he travels a lot for work.

Anyways around 6 or 7PM I was on my way home, more tired then usual after an incredibly long day which I won't go over because It would bore you, but to summon it up I had a massive headache and was really hungry, the only things nearby were a Burger King, McDonalds, etc... I definitely didn't want any of that junk, but it also raining and I had to get food before driving home otherwise I don't feel like I would be able to handle it.

so I figured by best friend who lived nearby would have been ok if I used my key to his house to go inside, microwave myself some dinner, wash whatever dishes I used then left, and so I did, I texted him first but didn't get a reply so I just went, I parked my car in his drivewayx knocked on the door, no response, so I went inside.


he wasn't home and neither was his fiancé, I had my dinner, cleaned the dishes I used then left, I felt so much better afterwards.


Anyways I got a text from him later and both him and his fiancé are absolutely furious at me.

While I was trying to justify myself I didn't even get to start my story, I only said a couple words and interrupted me  by saying there was no excuse, I told him not to interrupt me and he called me impatient,  I told him he was making a big deal out of nothing, and then he actually got upset and started being speaking aggressively to me so I hung up and sent him a message telling him not to worry and that I will pay them back for whoever much the food cost and give him back his keys, no response to my text.

now here’s what happened this morning:

his fiancé called me and she’s demanding I give back their keys and I told her i’ll stop by and do that on my way back home from work later today, she also called me names, funny thing is I was the one who introduced these two... 

I feel like it was an emergency, try driving an hour in the rain after working your ass off all day while having a massive headache and being hungry.

We've always been somewhat distant, and she misbehaves and is lazy with her homework. She's also on her phone a lot, even when I try to talk to her. I've thought about trying to take my ex to court for full custody of my daughter, but I feel like my daughter might choose her in the end and it would all be for nothing.

Sometimes my daughter tells me that my ex says hurtful things to her, and that she's not happy living there. But she's never once said she wanted to live with me. I tried to nudge her into saying it, but she hasn't, which really hurt me. So the last time she told me about a big fight they had, I told her it was her choice to stay there, and she could leave. She didn't say anything to that.

After thinking about it, I thought it might be better if she stopped sleeping over at my house, since she has roots with her mother and it's clear to me they have the closer, better relationship.

851,yklhhj,AITA for taking our son trick or treating without my wife?,taking our son trick or treating without my wife,"My (29m) wife (30f) and I have a four year old son. As Halloween approached this year, my son let me know that he wanted to dress up as characters from his favorite show at the moment. These aren’t costumes that are readily available to buy, so I was going to have to do some crafting magic and make them. 

I’m a stay at home father and my wife is something of a workaholic. She could cut down on her hours if she wished, but she’s always been a very work driven/focused person. She’s not very maternal. Because of this, my son has never been very attached to her. They have time together at dinner, but even during times when my wife is off work (like during bath time and bed time) it’s always just me. This isn’t me complaining; I signed on for the SAHD life and I enjoy every minute of it. I just wish, for his sake, that she would be more involved.

About a month before Halloween, my son asked if my best friend (35m) could dress up with us. He had already assigned himself and me a specific character and I had started work on the costumes, so I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal to add one more. He ADORES Best Friend. They have such a sweet bond, and have since my son was born. I asked Best Friend if he wanted to join us trick or treating, and he immediately agreed.

During dinner the night following this, I asked him what character he wanted his mom to be. My son said he only wanted to go trick or treating with daddy and Best Friend. Over the course of the next month, I would casually bring it up again to my son and he continually gave the same answer. My wife was clearly hurt but would always brush it off.

Fast forward to Halloween night. I had spent weeks working on these little costumes for all of us. As we were getting ready, my wife and I got into a big argument over the fact that she didn’t have a costume. I pointed out that if she had wanted me to make her one, she could have requested I do so, or she could have gotten one for herself. She said it was ridiculous that the three of us were doing a matching theme and leaving her out of it, and that she wasn’t even going.

In the end, Best Friend and I took him trick or treating alone and my wife still isn’t speaking to me because she “can’t believe I actually went without her.” 

AITA?

ETA: To clarify, I do not let my son ""call the shots,"" or allow him to make decisions that would harm him. I absolutely WILL step in when he could possibly get hurt. This was not one of those times. 

I practice gentle parenting as much as possible and in my mind, it wouldn't have been beneficial to Mom and son's bond to force him to choose a costume / include her in the matching outfits when he had expressed multiple times that he didn't want that. I think that bonding needs to happen in situations where my son is not only a willing participant, but **an enthusiastic one.** At dinner, there are times when he attempts to interact with her and it seems like she just zones out or doesn't bother engaging with him in a meaningful way. That is where I think their bonding needs to start: from the ground up. Not forced via a matching costume that my son has not been receptive to.

Another thing I wanted to address: I've seen many comments saying ""mom not coming should have never been presented as an option to him, you should have asked him 'what character should mom be?' instead,"" which I *did.* With that being said, I will fully admit that I should have done more to include her. But on the other hand, I didn't think a lack of costume (we've gone trick or treating in the past without costumes, as most adults with children have) would cause her to not go at all. This is why I felt that if she saw it as such a big deal, she should have brought it up herself. 

Just wanted to explain further and address some concerns I had seen. Thanks for all the well meaning, constructive comments.

855,ykl5mt,"AITA for removing my pre-weight loss pictures from my mom’s house, after she refused to take them down?",removing my preweight loss pictures from my mom’s house after she refused to take them down,"I (21F) have struggled with my weight my entire life. I’m not talking about baby weight. I mean that I was 200 lbs at 5’1’’ when I was 16. For as long as I could remember, I felt uncomfortable in my own body. When I went to college, I decided it was time to change. It took years of grueling work/education, but I’m finally at a healthy weight. I’m terrified of going back.


The only problem is that my mom (55F) has tons of family photos around the house. Every time I go home, I’m reminded of the most emotionally difficult time of my life. I begged my mom to at least take down the photos that only have me in them, but she refused.


I decided to take matters into my own hands. Every time I came to visit, I gradually put stickers over my face in family pictures. She didn’t notice, so I decided to take it up a notch.


I scanned the original pictures with my phone. I paid one of my friends to photoshop them afterward. They were pretty obvious, but I was hoping nobody would notice at a glance. After the swap, I took the originals to my apartment. I got away with this two times, but I got caught in the act with the third.


My mom and I got into a huge argument about it. She said that I had no right to take those photos, or “vandalize”  the others, because it wasn’t my house. I pointed out that I only took my photos and only put removable stickers on the others. She was still furious. I’m banned from the house until I give the originals back.


The rest of my family has been pressuring me to give in, because Thanksgiving is coming up. I refuse to do so, because I don’t think I’m in the wrong here. 


AITA?


Edit: I don’t know if this additional information changes anything, but I’ll add it just in case. I have a suspicion that my mom wouldn’t remove those photos for a deeper reason. She is obese, and I think she might be resentful of my weight loss.


Edit: Here’s some more information. I’m not ashamed of my past self, and I don’t hate my past self. I don’t like those pictures because they remind me of the constant, physical pain I was in at that weight. When I see them, it feels like reliving it all over again.


Edit: Here’s why I think my mom is resentful of my weight loss. 


She is obese and has made weird comments about my weight loss. Every since I lost the weight, she calls me vain a lot.

One time, we were sitting for dinner with my aunt. My aunt and I were discussing my weight loss, and my mom suddenly chimed in, “Ok, I think that enough time spent stroking your ego”.

Another time, she insisted on giving me a coat that was 3 times too big. When I said no, she asked if I thought I was too good for it.


Final edit: I’m going to take some of the advice  given here. I’m going to go ahead and burn the pictures I have, and give my mom an ultimatum between me and my solo pictures. If she chooses the pictures over me, that says more about her than me. I accept if this, and my past actions, makes me the asshole.",i f have struggled with my weight my entire life i’m not talking about baby weight i mean that i was lbs at ’’’ when i was for as long as i could remember i felt uncomfortable in my own body when i went to college i decided it was time to change it took years of grueling workeducation but i’m finally at a healthy weight i’m terrified of going back the only problem is that my mom f has tons of family photos around the house every time i go home i’m reminded of the most emotionally difficult time of my life i begged my mom to at least take down the photos that only have me in them but she refused i decided to take matters into my own hands every time i came to visit i gradually put stickers over my face in family pictures she didn’t notice so i decided to take it up a notch i scanned the original pictures with my phone i paid one of my friends to photoshop them afterward they were pretty obvious but i was hoping nobody would notice at a glance after the swap i took the originals to my apartment i got away with this two times but i got caught in the act with the third my mom and i got into a huge argument about it she said that i had no right to take those photos or “vandalize” the others because it wasn’t my house i pointed out that i only took my photos and only put removable stickers on the others she was still furious i’m banned from the house until i give the originals back the rest of my family has been pressuring me to give in because thanksgiving is coming up i refuse to do so because i don’t think i’m in the wrong here  edit i don’t know if this additional information changes anything but i’ll add it just in case i have a suspicion that my mom wouldn’t remove those photos for a deeper reason she is obese and i think she might be resentful of my weight loss edit here’s some more information i’m not ashamed of my past self and i don’t hate my past self i don’t like those pictures because they remind me of the constant physical pain i was in at that weight when i see them it feels like reliving it all over again edit here’s why i think my mom is resentful of my weight loss she is obese and has made weird comments about my weight loss every since i lost the weight she calls me vain a lot one time we were sitting for dinner with my aunt my aunt and i were discussing my weight loss and my mom suddenly chimed in “ok i think that enough time spent stroking your ego” another time she insisted on giving me a coat that was times too big when i said no she asked if i thought i was too good for it final edit i’m going to take some of the advice given here i’m going to go ahead and burn the pictures i have and give my mom an ultimatum between me and my solo pictures if she chooses the pictures over me that says more about her than me i accept if this and my past actions makes me the asshole,573,ESH
863,ykph78,AITA for coldly replying to my very pregnant sister that I’ll be making my own arrangements to get to her to help her for a full week after her first baby is born?,coldly replying to my very pregnant sister that i’ll be making my own arrangements to get to her to help her for a full week after her first baby is born,"So my (32F) baby sister (31) is having her first baby any day now (she’s being induced at 40 weeks due to medical concerns). I am becoming an auntie for the first time and I am very excited. Since she and my mom flew up when my husband and I had our first and only, I decided I wanted to fly down and help her and her husband as well! She was super thrilled and looking forward to the help. Since she was being induced, it may it easier to book a flight early on. 

Now to the conflict. it’s only a few days before her induction date and I text her to ask about arrangements for someone (her husband specifically) to pick me up at the airport. This is when she mentions that she’s not sure if she’ll be discharged in time to be able to have her husband get me and that she had arranged for our brothers to pick me up. I said, please don’t worry about the logistics of that, I’ll take care of it. You just focus on you and baby. 

Now, this is where I may be the asshole. I proceeded to ask her if her husband could drop me off at the airport when I return home a week later since at that point she would be home for at least 5-6 days prior all settled (barring an emergency c section or any unexpected medical emergency of course I thought), she proceeded to say we’ll figure it out. I ask her what is there to figure out and I reminded her that my husband left me alone with our daughter for almost three hours 4-5 days postpartum to pick her and then later on my mom and it was fine. She says we’ll figure it out. I get mad because this is the same entitled behavior she’s displayed since I left the church cult she still belongs to. She doesn’t approve of my choices and although our relationship is “good” now, I feel like I always have accommodate for her needs. She then complains she’s exhausted and has a long to do list and can’t think clearly to arrange my drop off. I understand she’s pregnant and tired. I coldly text her that I’ll take care of it and contact her husband once I arrive to know where I need to go and arrange for my own drop off. She never responded after that. 

I understand her pain, I’ve been there,  and worked up until the day before I went into labor unlike her, but her lack of planning is causing me to scramble to arrange how to get there which is an additional cost I didn’t plan for (and she’s a huge planner btw and very stingy with money) and our brothers live almost two hours away to the airport where I am landing.… so redditors, am I the asshole for texting my sister coldly to put her in her place for being an entitled pregnant woman?

Update: I accept my judgement as the asshole. I also accept that backing out now from being there for my sister when I already committed to her to being there would also make me an even bigger asshole. So I plan to keep things as originally planned. I will arrive, catch a Lyft ride (similar to Uber as Uber won’t pick up directly at the airport I am flying into for some reason) to their house or hospital depending on where her husband decides I’ll be the most helpful. I will also Lyft ride back that following Sunday so it saves my family the time and money. Although I was planning to pay for the gas (something I hadn’t mentioned in the post) I think it would be better time management for me to ride on my own as uncomfortable as it makes me feel. It’ll be good to overcome that fear and use my surroundings’ awareness. Thank you for the few kind redditors who saw my true intent and my trauma and validated them while still being able to call out my assholery. I’ll come back here to update on how the visit went.

875,ykq8db,AITA for not giving their dog back?,not giving their dog back,"My husband and I have a five year old beagle. We've been wanting to get a second beagle for a few months now. We found a five month old beagle for sale online. The ad said the owners were moving back to their home country so had to re-home him. We drove three hours to meet him, our current dog and him got along great so we decided to take him home with us.

When we got there, they gave us more info and they were actually only planning to visit their home country for six months as there was a mix up with their Visa. Their son lives with them and will be staying here but he works 12 hour days so they decided it would be best to give up their dog (Leo) as they didn't want him to be alone that much. Which I thought was a bit odd... If it's only going to be six months then put him in daycare or get a dog walker? But whatever, it was their decision.

We've had Leo since 9am Tuesday morning (it's now 9pm Wednesday night) and a couple hours ago the son texted me this: 

""My Mom has been extremely sad and in tears since Leo has left the house. She has asked me if there is any chance to get him back? Willing to return the money plus pay for your time to travel here or is it too late? I don't know what to do, just wanted to run it by you.'

We discussed and decided to keep Leo. Our older dog gets along so well with him, he's really everything we wanted and we love him already.

I went home and she yelled at me there saying thank God she came over because she found my husband asleep in his wheelchair and the kids were out of sight. I said I was in a rush, the babysitter didn't come and thought it wouldn't hurt if he watched them for a couple of hours. She argued about how irresponsible I was to leave my husband with the kids knowing he's unable to watch them like any other able bodied person could. She said I should've made sure someone was with the kids and my husband. I had a screaming match with her and my husband just watched. She left and told her family about what a horrible mother I was and even claimed I was abusing my husband by giving him tasks he can not handle. They of course sided with her.

908,yl7cqe,AITA for putting mistakes in my shared google doc notes,putting mistakes in my shared google doc notes,"This is a throwaway account.

I(21M) am currently taking Organic Chemistry I. Needless to say, the class is incredibly tough. Luckily though, I have been studying since day 1 so I am doing alright in the class. I am taking the class with a group of friends, so to help them out, I shared the personal notes that I take in class with them via a google doc, and I encouraged them to invite anyone they know. 

Recently, one of my friends invited a friend of theirs, let's call her Jess(20F), who i've never really interacted with, but I have a massive crush on. I think she and I would make a great couple, but she's not really into sensitive smart guys, because on her Instagram, I see all her stories show her out with really jock-like men.

Our third exam is in a couple of days, and as I was going through the google doc, I realized that she was using my doc the most. You can see who looks at or edits the doc on google docs, and most of my other friends would pop up sometimes, but I would see her icon pop up alot. I also know for a fact that she isn't doing well in the class, so I got a really good idea. I would put subtle mistakes in the doc so that she wouldn't do well in the exam, and then I can offer to tutor her. That way, I can interact with her and talk to her, so that she'll realize that I have a great personality, and we can hopefully go out together.

I told my friend about this plan, and they called me an ""incel AH"". Personally, I think they're overreacting, because Jess isn't going to do well either way, even if I don't put mistakes, so my plan will actually benefit her grades, while also allowing me to interact with her and talk to her.

910,yl3rqd,AITA for chewing my 8year old out for 'only thinking about herself' ?,chewing my year old out for only thinking about herself,"TL;Dr: daughter (8f) got an earful after she did not accommodate me when I was picking her up


Background: two days ago I had to go to the hospital as I had major cramps and my cervix opened up a little. The estimated date of birth is in mod December so it's still early and I have been given medication, allowed to go home, however I am to mostly lay down and not walk around if not necessary. Daughter knows all of that and usually is considerate 


My daughter has Kung Fu every Thursday. The arrangement is her school gives her notice when she is supposed to leave, she goes to the school bus, school bus takes her to practice, she is picked up by my husband when done. Today however both her and her teacher forgot. I found out because I always call her when she is supposed to be on the bus to make sure everything is ok. Well she forgot, things happen, no Biggie. I told her to be waiting and ready, as I am getting to my car now and will be there in 6 minutes to pick her up. I arrive at school, no kid at the entrance. I try to call and call - she doesn't pick up her phone. So I get out of the car and waddle around the school. She decided she still has time to go to the playground at the very back of the school to play with her friends and is not even slightly packed up (Backback and sportsgear still inside school). While she gets her stuff and packs up, I wait and my cramps start again ( yippieh:/ ) 
By the time she returns I am quite annoyed as we still have to go all the way around the school to the front where the car is. She looks at her watch and tells me to hurry up. Now, usually that would be no big deal, however walking means pain right now -> So she gets an earful. About how I told her to be waiting, which she wasn't. She was supposed to be ready and also wasn't. Also she knows I am supposed to lie down, yet still decides it's ok to make me circle her school because she'd rather have some more playtime instead of waiting in the front. If I or anybody helps her out, she should make it easier on the person helping and never harder then it needs to be. Then again why am I supposed to rush and get into more pain because she decided to not be ready and prepared and instead go to the playground, so I have to look for her and walk while she knows I shouldn't be. I also think the very least she could do were to say sorry, which she didn't. I still drove her to practice though and she was silent on the way there. Hubs says she is 8, she is allowed to sometimes forget things and it's hard for 8 year olds to be empathetic. So AITA? Is she just being typical 8 year old or can I expect some more empathy from her?


Edit: a few actually. I read all your comments and thought about them while she was still in practice. I am grateful for your advice and insight and some of you have have given me a lot by their words. I thank you a lot and probably will reread your advice from time to time, as I think it is valuable beyond this instance. I maybe need to mention that I am not a native speaker so I maybe did pick the wrong expression. 'I gave her an earful' would translate for us into I gave her a longer talk. I didn't yell nor was I aggressive. I did say word for word 'I am annoyed about you being not ready and waiting.' and then explained why (pain walking). Yelling is kept for emergencies and immediate danger (like car approaching and kids not paying attention). Second we are in rural Germany. Kids here grow up different compared to e.g. us. It is expected of them to get to primary school by themselves. In her class we were kind of late bloomers in terms of allowing her to go by herself. Right now she is in a class of 24 kids, of which 3 get picked up and dropped off. The rest walks, rides a bike or takes the school bus. Teachers will approach you a lot of you don't let them. also the kids don't go alone alone. Just without parents. Usually they meet or pick each other up and then go together. Criminal rates here are on a very different level then in other parts of the world. 
Next point: 
Some of you called my child a brat or self centered and entitled. She is not. She is allowed to make mistakes and I am supposed to help her to learn to not make mistakes. Doesn't make her a brat. 
Lastly : we talked. She said sorry for not listening and told me she heard me, she knew she was supposed to be at the gate and start packing instantly- but hoped she still had a few minutes left for play and then lost track of time because she just had so much fun. We compromised on her trusting her wrist watch more next time meaning packing, then checking if there is time left and not the other way round. I told her sorry, too and used the insight some of you were generous to share with me. We hugged it out. I also mentioned how pregnancy is neither her fault not responsibility - she responded 'ohana' (reference to a movie we all love) and that made me laugh out loud and her giggle.

We wanted our older daughter (11F) to be excited about the move and when we were delegating bedrooms we wanted her to have the 2nd largest with its own bathroom except for the master. 

She has some ADHD along with some other mental health issues. And unfortunately in the 4 months we’ve lived here she destroyed her virtually new and freshly painted bedroom. 

Broken blinds, broken cabinet, marker on the walls, nail polish on the counter, paint in the carpet, scuffs, paint chips from trying to hang up sticky items, holes from trying to put up decor, she’s broken two soft close toilet seats from trying to shut them too fast. She’s also having trouble keeping it clean and isn’t treating her furniture nicely. It’s purely from carelessness. 

I want her to have nice things. I want her to have a beautiful bedroom and safe place to relax. The transition to a new town has been difficult for her. 

At the same time I am so sad whenever I walk into that room. We invested so much into it. I can see it’s a reflection of her current mental state. 

I’m not going to disrupt her siblings rooms so she would be moving into the small office and the office/guest room would move into her room. She’d need to share a bathroom.

Her father and I said no, we're keeping them up. To me, she should be proud of where she came from and not worry about what other people think. And the kicker? It's not that she has any new videos of her singing since then, or that she plans to upload any time soon, though she said she ""might"" in the future. Honestly, my daughter has very half-assed done music since she graduated (3 years ago), so I don't know why she has made these videos the target of her hatred.

She has asked again for us to take them down a few months after the first time, and then a last time just a week ago. I've already told her to not ask me again, they're staying up. Especially as these are videos we recorded with our camera so it is our property.

933,ylnv6p,"AITA for calling my sister ""obsessed"" with her (deceased) husband?",calling my sister obsessed with her deceased husband,"I (35M) was one of those kids that knew exactly what I wanted to do when I grew up. In order to remain anonymous, I'll simply say I've always dreamed of doing job X at company Y. My whole career has been based on getting this job and working for this company. So needless to say when I finally got an interview with company Y I was ecstatic. 

After a very lengthy interview process, I received a phone call yesterday letting me know that I had gotten the job. I was so excited. I immediately called my parents, who were so proud of me. My dad suggested that we go out for dinner to celebrate at our family's special occasion restaurant. They wanted to take me and my sister Megan (33F) out to celebrate the achievement. I was riding on cloud nine. 

I called my sister to tell her the news and the dinner plans. She congratulated me, but told me that she wouldn't be able to come. My mood immediately dropped, and I asked her why not. She told me that she had plans already with her (deceased) husband Miguel's family. 

I explained to her that this was a serious achievement that had taken a lifetime of work, and that I had finally achieved my dream. I told her that I needed her there to celebrate with me. She congratulated me again, but told me that this was a very important family celebration and she simply could not miss it. 

For context: Megan and Miguel were married for a few months before he passed. It was really tragic, and she has my deepest sympathies. I understand how important he was to her, although I don't exactly agree with how she's handled his death. I understand her sorrow and sadness, but don't agree that she should be missing out on celebrating my achievements because her husband passed. She can (and does) mourn any other day of the year, but this is a once in a lifetime achievement. I got my dream job and she of all people should know how much that means to me.

This is the part where I may be a bit of an asshole. I called her out and said that missing out on her actual families celebrations to celebrate her husband's death with his family is a dick move. I told her that she couldn't spend the rest of her life obsessing over Miguel, and that at some point she needed to move on. Her obsession with him was ruining our relationship, and once again re-iterated that I needed her to be there with me tonight. 

She actually laughed at me and said that ""of course she was obsessed with him"". She said a few other hurtful things, before she hung up the phone. 

My parents and I ended up going out for dinner just the three of us. Today my sister texted me and said we could go for dinner this weekend if I apologize for acting like such an ass. But I honestly don't think I should have to when she missed out on my thing. She also said some hurtful things, and doesn't seem to think she's in the wrong at all. So I want to know, AITA?

942,yltzhb,AITA for not going to my emotionally absent dad’s birthday dinner even though he financially provided for me?,not going to my emotionally absent dad’s birthday dinner even though he financially provided for me,"I (29f) have an extremely odd relationship with my dad. We lived in the same house for 20 years but we barely know each other. 

He just never seemed that interested in me when I was a kid. He was the main breadwinner and worked hard to financially provide for us. He’d leave the house at 9am and come back at 10pm six to seven days a week; as a result, I never saw him much. When I did see him, he never asked me questions about myself or my life. He became more interested when I was a teenager, but by then it was too late and I wanted nothing to do with him. 

It’s his birthday next weekend and my mom wants me to go to his birthday dinner. It’s a 90 min drive. I don’t want to go because I don’t like him and I don’t have a relationship with him at all. I’d rather spend my Saturday doing something else. My mom says I’m extremely selfish for this and  that my dad financially provided for us and never abused us so I should be grateful and love him. 

However the memories I have of him growing up are negative. He said sexist things (eg women should be in the kitchen helping prepare food, I should dress more femininely), he told me more than once when I was a kid that I needed plastic surgery for my nose and eyes, and he disapproved of my tomboyish hobbies because it wasn’t more feminine. 

What makes it more ironic is that my dislike of him is also due to my mom constantly badmouthing him when I was a kid. I am a classic example of “girl with daddy issues” where I crave approval/attention from older men and am pretty much and have always been only attracted to men 15-25 years older than me. Every man I am attracted to, I also want them to be my dad. It’s messed up, it’s caused me a lot of grief, and I can’t help but blame my dad for this. 

But maybe my mom is right and I am being too harsh on him? He did not have an easy life, a lot of his sexism comes from Korean culture (he moved to the States in his early 20s), his parents are also very emotionally unavailable, and I can’t help but believe that I also contributed to our broken relationship. When I was a teenager he’d try to talk to me more and I’d ignore him. When he came into a room, I’d leave it. I also can’t tell if this is just how all Korean dads are, and I’m judging him too harshly by western cultural standards. 

So AITA here? He did provide for me financially my whole life and could have been a way worse dad. Do I owe him to go to this birthday dinner?",i f have an extremely odd relationship with my dad we lived in the same house for years but we barely know each other he just never seemed that interested in me when i was a kid he was the main breadwinner and worked hard to financially provide for us he’d leave the house at am and come back at pm six to seven days a week as a result i never saw him much when i did see him he never asked me questions about myself or my life he became more interested when i was a teenager but by then it was too late and i wanted nothing to do with him it’s his birthday next weekend and my mom wants me to go to his birthday dinner it’s a min drive i don’t want to go because i don’t like him and i don’t have a relationship with him at all i’d rather spend my saturday doing something else my mom says i’m extremely selfish for this and that my dad financially provided for us and never abused us so i should be grateful and love him however the memories i have of him growing up are negative he said sexist things eg women should be in the kitchen helping prepare food i should dress more femininely he told me more than once when i was a kid that i needed plastic surgery for my nose and eyes and he disapproved of my tomboyish hobbies because it wasn’t more feminine what makes it more ironic is that my dislike of him is also due to my mom constantly badmouthing him when i was a kid i am a classic example of “girl with daddy issues” where i crave approvalattention from older men and am pretty much and have always been only attracted to men years older than me every man i am attracted to i also want them to be my dad it’s messed up it’s caused me a lot of grief and i can’t help but blame my dad for this but maybe my mom is right and i am being too harsh on him he did not have an easy life a lot of his sexism comes from korean culture he moved to the states in his early s his parents are also very emotionally unavailable and i can’t help but believe that i also contributed to our broken relationship when i was a teenager he’d try to talk to me more and i’d ignore him when he came into a room i’d leave it i also can’t tell if this is just how all korean dads are and i’m judging him too harshly by western cultural standards so  here he did provide for me financially my whole life and could have been a way worse dad do i owe him to go to this birthday dinner,483,YTA

My mom had an affair with another man and as a result my sister was born, my mom got full custody in court so I can never see my dad without my moms permission which she would never give. 

Since the day my sister has been born I’ve been jealous of her because my step dad and my mom favor her over me, which is surprising because she acts like a spoiled brat but my mom and step dad will give her whatever she wants all the meanwhile neglecting me.

One day my mom and step dad went out and forced me to babysit her instead of going out with my friends.

We went to a corn festival by my house, which has a corn maze and a corn field.

My sister and I went into the corn maze, as we were walking through it, a storm started to appear. By the time we got out, it was pouring. But suddenly my sister ran straight toward the corn field. 

I yelled at her “Come over here!” And she responded with, “No, I don’t want to go home!” and started to cry.

As she began to have a tantrum one of the festival staff ran up to me and told me to get back quick or we could get caught up in the storm, or more specifically a tornado that was coming straight for our area. I assumed that one of the rescue staff would come and save her so without thinking i left.

Me and my sister both ended up fine and were able to get back to the main building at the entrance of the festival. when we got home I explained this to my parents and they got extremely angry and grounded me for a month they also told my relatives and now they all think i’m a selfish teenager that doesn’t care about my sisters life.

961,ylqkfy,AITA for Venting the Meat Smell Out of the House?,venting the meat smell out of the house," I'm a vegetarian, and have been since before I met my boyfriend. He's always been great about using meat substitutes to cook, and doesn't keep much meat in the house (it's his house if that matters). He tells everyone he doesn't eat much meat because he doesn't think it's fair to eat what I can't, but I always tell him that it's my choice to not eat meat, and he can eat what he wants. He buys things like cold cuts, chicken legs, etc on occasion.

 Tonight I woke up from a nap, to him searing a steak. At first it was no big deal, but soon our whole 4 bedroom house was humid and smelled like meat so strongly that it was making me nauseated. 

 So I set up a box fan, pushed the smell back into the kitchen, and opened the kitchen door and blew the smell out, and lit a candle in the living room where I was. 

 When I went to take the fan back out, my boyfriend was so mad, talking about how I don't let him eat what he wants, and that I say he can but that's not true. I never told him he couldn't eat the steak, or even how disgusted I was, I simply set up the fan and that was enough. I just wanted the humidity/smell to dissipate. 

 Now me says I ruined his dinner, by trying to limit what he eats. That he liked forward to his steak, and i ruined it. I just can't stand the smell of cooking meat ***so strong*** that it comes through the heating vents into all rooms. He's cooked meat before, and I've never complained, but this had a lot of seasoning on it and was so strong (he was frying it in a pan on top of the stove).

 AITA for venting the smell/ humidity outside? I feel like I may be because maybe I should have just taken the car and left for a few hours instead of using the fan. Maybe  I'm TA just for being a vegetarian?

974,ylp70s,AITA For getting mad when my sibling banned me from their laptop?,getting mad when my sibling banned me from their laptop,"So I (F18) share a ps4 with my younger brother (15) & sibling (G/n21) & when we got home from school, our sibling was already playing Red Dead Online with their posse members on the PS4 when we got there which was around 4:30. Our brother asks them when he can have a turn, they say Idk, he returns with the proposal of 8-10pm, they get irritated & rudely answer, I start I fight with them over it, lasting awhile. Would add more detail, but Reddit has a character limit.

They're pissed and eventually turn back to the game, think their mic has been on the entire time and furiously turn the ps4 off and leaves the room with 'You can have it since I've just embarrassed myself.'

At this point, I start feeling bad. I wanted them to apologize, not be humiliated (later revealed didn't happen). With some deliberating & time thinking to myself, I knew I was in the wrong for starting the fight because I've had bad days & snapped too, and they usually apologize later, but with how our sibling is after fights, they make it very hard to apologize.

Then our sibling told me I'm no longer allowed to use their laptop or gaming Headset. Which I actually didn't mind because of how during the fight they'd said something about how one of the things I have on the laptop is making it hard to do schooling & therapy because of how slow it is, & they've left to the laundry mat so I can't say anything to them, but I really want to apologize for having started the fight. So I text them a heartfelt apology, just saying what I did in the previous paragraph, plus more.

Only to then get left on read, ignored, told that the thing I thought they were talking about making their laptop slow was in fact NOT what they were talking about, it was the other thing that I had already uninstalled, they say, 'oh, well, I was probably overreacting & getting frustrated when my classes & session loaded a little too slow for my liking, so It's probably fine', their tone is a lot more cooled down at this point and they sound reasonable right now, but I get this weird feeling that they're gatekeeping the laptop, so I ask. ""So just to clarify and clear things up, am I allowed to use your laptop?""

""No"" ""...May I ask why?"" & I swear to God, they unironically say. ""Cause I'm a bitch.""

They had planned to keep the laptop from me for a whole week. To ""prove a point"" that they weren't being a bitch before, it's called an ""angry response"" and that they're sick of getting called a bitch all the time for everything they say that we (specifically me & our mom, probably) disliked them saying. They said, ""If you're gonna call me a bitch, you'll get a bitch."" This is after they read my message, btw.

Unless I AM the asshole. If I am, I would love for someone to help me understand why.

Me and my fiance want the wedding to be more intimate with family and close friends, and there's a budget to keep to as well. As a result, we've decided to give +1s to married or engaged couples only. 

My sister, we'll call her C, is one of my bridesmaids. She obviously knew that she'd be invited, but she received the actual invite at the same time as everyone else. C has a boyfriend, but they aren't engaged or married hence she didn't receive a +1.

C was furious, I explained multiple times it's not just her, no one received a +1 if they aren't engaged or married, this is what we decided would be best. She said she's going to drop out as bridesmaid over the ""disrespect"" we're showing them. 

My parents aren't too pleased with this rule either, saying we should make an exception for C because she's my sister. The thing is if I make exceptions, other guests might start asking why they didn't receive a +1 for their boyfriend/girlfriend, even if they've been dating for a week or something.

From the age of 2-16 and 25-now I have lived in 6 different countries, first with my parents and going to school abroad, then after graduate school I moved abroad again by my own choice to work, presently in South Korea.

I am currently visiting friends and family in America for the first time in almost 3 years, and my parents and I are currently visiting my aunt and grandmother (in New England). After lunch yesterday my grandmother said ""I'm so glad to hear you'll be moving back home to New England soon!"", and it turns out my dad told her that. It's not true at all, I have no plans on moving ""home"" anytime soon, and I've never actually lived here. My parents know that, and when I asked my mom later she said my dad told a white lie just to make his mom happy (she's 98). 

Honestly, I would have gone along with the lie and not really cared if my parents told me beforehand. But when I asked my dad about it later, he said it was probably a lie but also that he hoped I would actually move back to America and settle down and get married soon. That's when I lost it on him, saying/shouting that it was his fault that I would never settle down, seeing as how the only thing I knew was moving from place to place due to his job (mostly true), not being able to have long-term friendships or serious relationships (not really true), and that I hated having to move around all the time anyway (was true for a bit but now I love it), and that I never want to move back to America (not true). In reality, I'm not ruling out moving to America, settling down with someone, having kids, etc..., just that I don't know if I want to or not, and certainly not immediately. 

He hasn't talked to me since. My mom actually doesn't seem bothered about any of what I said, saying that she's fine with me living my own life and doing whatever, but also said that I should keep up the lie to my grandmother, and apologize to my dad for talking to him that way and that he had meant well all along, both for me as well as doing good work for the UN.

My MIL is going to be watching our son and our plan for months has been to have her come to our house for Thanksgiving and stay with us until our vacation.  This way she can get a good grasp of our son's routine and it will give them both a chance for us to talk to them about any questions because they might not be able to reach us 24/7 while we are away.  

However, my wife's family has suddenly decided that they want to have a big family Thanksgiving.  My wife's uncle and his family decided to fly in from overseas for Thanksgiving this year.  They decided this within the last week.  This uncle has a lot of money and has made spur of the moment decisions like this in the past regarding holidays.  Because he lives overseas and doesn't get to see family often, the rest of the family always caters to his whims and makes last minute plans to get everyone together.

The host for Thanksgiving this year lives an 8-hour drive from us.  My wife and MIL want to go.  I absolutely do not.  I think that will be way too much driving and time away from our house so close to our vacation.  It's going to rush everything else we have to do before we leave.  Not to mention the added costs of driving that far and getting a hotel when we are already spending thousands on our vacation.  It won't break the bank for us, but it's a large unplanned expense that I don't want.    

I told my wife that if she and MIL want to go, I will stay home with our son.  My wife said that she wants to bring our son so that he can play with his cousins.  I told her I will stay home by myself then to start preparing for our trip.  She told me I can't do that because she'll need my help with driving and with our son.  

I told her this is her family and her uncle and it's not my fault they planned this all so late.  I told her we had plans we all agreed on, MIL included, and I don't want to pack in another huge trip so close to our vacation.  She said that she hasn't seen this uncle and his family since pre-pandemic and it's really important to her.  I reiterated that she and MIL can go and she can choose whether or not to bring our son, but I am going to be staying home.  

She thinks I am being unreasonable and inflexible and that if this was my family, I would be jumping through hoops to see them.  She says we can make everything work if we all work together.  She agrees that yes, it will make things harder, but it's not impossible especially if I pitch in and help.  

I just think it's trying to pack too much in so close to our vacation and I would prefer to stick to our original plan.  If for nothing else than to keep our son comfortable before we leave him for a week.",my wife f and i m are going on a vacation with a couple of friends the first week of december weve been planning this trip for over months and its the first vacation weve taken since our son was born years ago im really looking forward to relaxing on a beach and sitting at a pool bar for a week my mil is going to be watching our son and our plan for months has been to have her come to our house for thanksgiving and stay with us until our vacation this way she can get a good grasp of our sons routine and it will give them both a chance for us to talk to them about any questions because they might not be able to reach us while we are away however my wifes family has suddenly decided that they want to have a big family thanksgiving my wifes uncle and his family decided to fly in from overseas for thanksgiving this year they decided this within the last week this uncle has a lot of money and has made spur of the moment decisions like this in the past regarding holidays because he lives overseas and doesnt get to see family often the rest of the family always caters to his whims and makes last minute plans to get everyone together the host for thanksgiving this year lives an hour drive from us my wife and mil want to go i absolutely do not i think that will be way too much driving and time away from our house so close to our vacation its going to rush everything else we have to do before we leave not to mention the added costs of driving that far and getting a hotel when we are already spending thousands on our vacation it wont break the bank for us but its a large unplanned expense that i dont want i told my wife that if she and mil want to go i will stay home with our son my wife said that she wants to bring our son so that he can play with his cousins i told her i will stay home by myself then to start preparing for our trip she told me i cant do that because shell need my help with driving and with our son i told her this is her family and her uncle and its not my fault they planned this all so late i told her we had plans we all agreed on mil included and i dont want to pack in another huge trip so close to our vacation she said that she hasnt seen this uncle and his family since prepandemic and its really important to her i reiterated that she and mil can go and she can choose whether or not to bring our son but i am going to be staying home she thinks i am being unreasonable and inflexible and that if this was my family i would be jumping through hoops to see them she says we can make everything work if we all work together she agrees that yes it will make things harder but its not impossible especially if i pitch in and help i just think its trying to pack too much in so close to our vacation and i would prefer to stick to our original plan if for nothing else than to keep our son comfortable before we leave him for a week,585,YTA
1010,ym0pj4,AITA for going off on my girlfriend for eating all the food?,going off on my girlfriend for eating all the food,"Last saturday, we had friends come over for a game night. There was 17 people in our appartment. We bought 200$ worth of hors d'oeuvres such as eggrolls, small pastries with meat or cheese and some chips. As the main dish I asked my aunt to cook us her special macaroni in the over, chicken wings and nuggets. There was so much food, everyone left with a plate. Sunday we ate out of the leftovers but there was still enough food to eat for the rest of the week (there was a lot of food).

She works from home and I from an office. Sunday night she packed the food in the fridge. I noticed monday morning that there was less macaroni than what was left the previous day (meaning she ate during the night). I'm the type that doesn't like to eat heavy at lunch otherwise it makes me sleepy so I made sandwiches for lunch thinking I'm goin to eat some macaroni, wings and pastries for supper. Monday 7pm when I go to the fridge, all the pastries and chicken wings are gone! At the same time my sister came over to do my girlfriend's hair and I asked :''Honey did you pack the hors d'oeuvres somewhere else, I can't find them?'' She replied there was none left. I didn't want to make a scene in front of my sister so I took a plate of macaroni. The next day (tueday) she made me a steak with veggies for lunch and in the afternoon I had a seminar with paid dinner so I didn't eat none of the leftovers. Then comes wednesday, I had sandwiches for lunch again but when I got home I was hungry, went to the fridge and realised there was no food left. She ate everything, that mountain of food we had for a week is gone.

That's when I snapped and told her she didn't leave me any. At first she denied eating everything but I told her we're only two here, I only ate a plate when my sister came on monday. Then she said she thought I had taken my share. I told her clearly no. Then she replies there's no use being mad for food when we can just go and buy more. I'm just being petty. I told her it doesn't make sense that you ate all this food in 3 days and that you didn't even notice that I didn't have any. It's easy to say that it's just food when you ate it all.

Now she's mad at me apparently for yelling at her and being too old, (I'm 36), to react like this. I'm 6''1' and 205 and she's 5''8', 185. During the last two years, she gained at least 40 lbs while I've stayed the same. I'm seeing red right now and have no one to vent my anger because I don't want people I know to see her in a bad light. Am I an asshole or not?

Then she said ""you single dads have it so much easier than single moms."" The stuff she was complaining about seemed more about her being lazy and it's not like her kid's dad isn't as involved as she is 

I, on the other hand, am raising an 5yo and 8yo solo. There is no child support, no one to take them off my hands, etc. I can't tell you how helpful it is when both of them have an after school playdate with other kids. Parents take little stuff like that for granted.

In response, I told the single mom it's not that I have it easier, it's that I have my shit together. She was pretty offended by my remark but it's true.

Yesterday, I was speaking to my son's teacher. She's someone I wouldn't get along with so I don't try to deal with her unless I have to deal with her. She asked me if I thought it was being helpful by telling other parents that they're lazy.

I asked her if she's being helpful with her grammar and spelling errors in her class emails. She asked what errors. I said I'll send her some examples because I wanted to be helpful. So I did and she hasn't responded.

Yesterday, I saw her going through her now too big clothes and putting them into piles. I asked what she was doing and she said she is sorting the clothes to throw them out/ donate them.

Now my wife has done a few yo-yo diets before. Always losing weight very rapidly then suddenly stopping and gaining even more back. For that reason, I told her that she shouldn't throw them out just yet, we have enough space for them in the house, maybe wait a year.

She got really mad at me, accused me of being unsupportive and not believing in her. I told her I believe in her, it just already happened a few times before and clothes are expensive. She said that it's different this time, it's not a fad diet but a 'lifestyle change', etc. Even though I tried to make her see my point, she kept being mad at me to the point that she didn't even pack my lunch for work today. 

At work, my coworkers asked me how come I don't have packed lunch with me today and I explained them what happened with my wife.

1037,ym2xdl,AITA for feigning a food allergy?,feigning a food allergy,"I was in a restaurant yesterday talking about this story and decided to ask this here to see your opinion. It's an old story, and I'm still friends with the guy, we're cool.

You see, I hate peanuts. Lucky for me, I'm not from the USA, so I don't have to deal with stuff like peanut butter, snickers and Reese's candies on a daily basis like they do. Only within the ""fitness world"". So I'm friends with this guy who's very into sports and fitness (good for him) and a few years ago I was at his house and he offered these oat+peanut cookies. You see, every other time I've told people that I didn't like **X\*** or any food with 'X', they'd always go with ""Oh but just taste it, it's so good, you'll hardly feel the X in it"" and never take a no until I do eat it (and it always tastes awful).

So this time, seeing as I had just met him and he wouldn't know about it, at first I said ""no thanks I don't eat peanuts"", and when he went with the old ""you can't hardly taste them"" and all the benefits of it, I said ""yeah but I can't eat it anyway, I'm allergic"". He got really scared, and put the cookies away quickly. After that he asked if there was any danger in me breathing around the peanuts or touching it, and I said I had no problem with it, I'd just feel sick by eating it.

Years passed and we're cool, and since it worked I said the same to other people as well. Except one day we're talking and the food allergy subject came back, when he asked if I ever had to use an epipen before. So I decided to tell him (as we were friends by then) that I'm not really allergic, I was just tired of people insisting on me eating food I didn't like and all. He didn't really get mad, but he told me that it was an AH move to fake a disease like that, that he thought it was serious and always made sure to check if anything he offered me had any peanuts beforehand...as he should, I think?

1038,ym2vkd,AITA for calling my brother an idiot?,calling my brother an idiot,"So the other day, a bunch of my family got together to have dinner, and we all get along really well, so it's a good time. Eventually, my older brother puts out an open challenge for people to come up with haiku's. I like haiku's, so I decided to make something up, and I quickly think of something admittedly really stupid, but I say it against my better judgment:

""I love chicken nugs 
I'll eat a chicken tendie 
Yum yum in my tum""

After I share this amazingly stupid haiku, my brother looks at me like I'm stupid, which, that's fair, it was a stupid haiku, but I came up with it in like 4 seconds, so whatever. But then my brother says how he and my younger brother make haiku's that are 66 syllables in total(20, 20, 26) and then goes on about this trick he came up with where you make the haiku with 68 syllables and remove the last 2, which is somehow supposed to be easier?

Now, I won't lie, if you cam make a ""haiku"" with 66 syllables, that's impressive, but it's not a haiku, and I point this out to everyone. Everyone seems to agree with this statement, but my brother argued that it's fine to make his own rules to haiku's since we aren't Asian. The argument about the length of a haiku goes on for a few minutes until I get fed up and call my brother an idiot and leave the table, not wanting to hear anymore of this stupid conversation.

When I rejoined the dining room, the conversation was thankfully changed to something else, but looking back at it, and having time to think about it, I feel bad for calling him an idiot and getting mad at him (and also everyone else for agreeing with him) and now I'm wondering if I was a bit of an asshole for getting so worked up over something so trivial.",so the other day a bunch of my family got together to have dinner and we all get along really well so its a good time eventually my older brother puts out an open challenge for people to come up with haikus i like haikus so i decided to make something up and i quickly think of something admittedly really stupid but i say it against my better judgment i love chicken nugs ill eat a chicken tendie yum yum in my tum after i share this amazingly stupid haiku my brother looks at me like im stupid which thats fair it was a stupid haiku but i came up with it in like seconds so whatever but then my brother says how he and my younger brother make haikus that are syllables in total and then goes on about this trick he came up with where you make the haiku with syllables and remove the last which is somehow supposed to be easier now i wont lie if you cam make a haiku with syllables thats impressive but its not a haiku and i point this out to everyone everyone seems to agree with this statement but my brother argued that its fine to make his own rules to haikus since we arent asian the argument about the length of a haiku goes on for a few minutes until i get fed up and call my brother an idiot and leave the table not wanting to hear anymore of this stupid conversation when i rejoined the dining room the conversation was thankfully changed to something else but looking back at it and having time to think about it i feel bad for calling him an idiot and getting mad at him and also everyone else for agreeing with him and now im wondering if i was a bit of an asshole for getting so worked up over something so trivial,321,YTA

1043,ym22qj,AITA for not telling my mum who we sold our house?,not telling my mum who we sold our house,"Short facts:
-My maternal grandparents gave my parents the money to buy the house in 1998.
-My siblings and me became the owners, our parents became beneficial owners. 
-Dad passed away 3 years later, mum refused to get a job.
-Mum made huge depts, which always paid out by grans.
-The house now is very rundown tnx to mum's ""care"".

Five years ago, my mother (now 51) married a guy with, whom she moved into an apartment, and she left me and my siblings the house, which was once again in debt, with the sentence: ""Your hous, you solve it."" 
At that time, my sister (now 31) was already raising her own daughter alone, I (now nearly 28) was still studying and working (for little money), and my younger brother (now 26) was rebelling and didn't wanted to help. Our uncle helped us this time, because our mother did not contribute in any way to us to starting our lives on a stable footing, either financially or in other areas. While I lived there I payed the bills, took care of the garden ect.
I moved into a rental apartement with my partner a 3 years ago, and left the house in the care of my younger brother. Since then, I got married to my partner, and a year ago we moved 200 kms away from the house (and from my mother).
Meanwhile, my younger brother decided that he doesn't want to stay in the house, and my sister doesn't want to use it, even though she lives at our maternal grandparents with her dughter (7)  in one room. 
We found a childhood playmate who wanted buy it, but before that my mother had to give up her beneficial ownership. It wasn't an easy project because she didn't want to buy the whole house from us for herself (I asked about it from her several times), but she didn't want to gave it up for free either. Plus she found a buyer who she thought would have bought the property for a higher amount than what I told her it was worth (told half of the real price). So I reassured her that she would receive money from us after the sale, but I didn't told her that my siblings, the friend and I had already agreed on a purchase price.
So the beneficial ownership was cleared from the house, the sale took place last week. Our mother also received a minimal amount (2.2% of the total purchase price), which my sister gave her in cash. And now my mother is furious that we didn't tell her who would buy the house and for how much money.

1044,ym22nr,AITA For Calling GF a Pushover,calling gf a pushover,"AITA For being upset at my gf because she has no boundaries and never says no?

Girlfriend Gets Abused by Everyone and does Nothing About it.

My [24M] girlfriend [21F] let's everyone roll over her and abuse her and just shrugs it off. Friends and teachers say what they want about her and ask her for favours and she can never say no, even if she doesn't want to.

She got internship for a few months in another country and all her ""bosses"" and coworkers would abuse her with too much work, too many hours and outrageous requests and she never could say no and set boundaries, it went as far as sexual harassment from the boss but she was in another country far away and needed the grade so again did nothing about it.

Now she has gotten her first job, she is supposed to start in a few days and is already doing a ""training day"" today, for free for the full day (10h) basically working without pay and without contract. I'm upset because she hasn't even been been hired and is already being abused, she is setting a precedent that's not good and she gets mad at me for saying that she's being a pushover. She could have said no, negotiated some pay and set some boundaries, but instead she is in the store doing nothing and too afraid to ask to leave early.

I have been working since I'm 18, if you don't set boundaries at the beginning bosses are just going to keep abusing and pushing.

I drove 2h after a 12h shift to be here with her and she can't even ask to leave early while doing an UNPAID and illegal (no contract yet) training, while a few months ago I asked and  left early from a fully paid training day to be with her.

Am I the asshole for calling her a pushover and basically starting a fight?


Edit: General consensus is I'm the asshole. I'm going to apologize when she comes back.

Every birthday I bake her a cake, ive done it since her first birthday. I was baking in the afternoon, when she got in the kitchen saying: Mom, I need to tell you something.

I stopped when I was doing to pay attention to her and asked what's wrong.

She said: Mom, I have to be honest with you \[She spoken a little speech here about how much she loves me and how she cant keep this secret anymore\] ... So, I'm that I can finally tell you that, I like girls, I'm a lesbian.

I immediately responded with: I know.

She was shocked, and shouted: You knew? How?

I said: Honey, you have gay written all over your face. Honestly, I wasn't even expecting you to come out, just to come home one day to introduce your girlfriend to us.

She started crying a little, then I continued talking and retelling some key moments that give away that she likes girls, like that moment in 1st grade when she referred to her best friend as her ""bride"".

She asked if her dad knows, and I said yes.

She was hurt. Said that she has been planning coming out for so long, that was riddled by anxiety every time she tried to speak to me or her dad about it, and that I should have told her that I knew, so she could skip all the near anxiety attacks.

I said that there was always a chance I could be wrong, or that she could be Bi or Pan, and in the end, she is a separate person and her sexuality is not my business. I told her I love her so much, that this changes nothing, and I will welcome any partner of hers.

She nodded with the head, but started crying and went to her room. I finished the cake, but she went out that night with her friends instead, I saved the cake in the fridge, waited for her to come home, but when she arrived went straight to her room.

Today, she left for school, barely saying good morning to me.

I don't know If I was too cold, too distant, or whatever, something is wrong here and I don't know if it is me.

AITA?

Update:

Hello, I'm back here. Last night I spoke to my daughter. 

She was still very emotional, but she allowed me to speak to her. I apologized for my response, I told her I was sorry, that I understood it was a big moment for her, and I wanted her to know that I will always love her.

She said was sorry for acting out, but I told her she had nothing to apologize for.

We had a long talk, she opened up about her fears. She was trying to be not be so obviously queer because some kids at her school are awful against queer kids, knowing that she is very obviously gay spiked her fears. I apologized again, and I will talk to the school administrators as soon as I can, I need to protect my daughter.

She spoke about her anxiety issues. After the talk she was calmer, but I'm worried about her, I think she might have an anxiety disorder, I'll book her a psychologist for that, she agreed to go to a psychologist. She also said that she loved me and was glad that I supported her.

I told everything to her dad. He also spoke to her to say more or less the same I did, and will take her to the movies tomorrow.

1058,ym6xu1,AITA for not wanting to pay my parents rent after we made a deal?,not wanting to pay my parents rent after we made a deal,"So for background I (22F) my sister (19F) and my parents made a deal for when we graduated highschool. The deal was this: after highschool graduation, if we were either in school full time OR working full time, we would not have to pay them rent and could stay in the house as long as we wanted. However, we DO pay for all of our own college tuition, cars payments/gas, clothes, and buy and cook our own food. We are both pretty great at money management. 

Now, it's been a couple years. My sister went 6 months no school or job and my parents didn't ask her to pay rent (she has a FT job now). Whereas I immediately went to school full time AND worked a bartending job 36 hours a week. So I didn't pay rent either, I upheld my end of the deal. I recently started a full time (50hrs a week) job in my field and took a huge pay cut (about 50% less) to do so. 

This entire time, my father has not had a real job. He doesn't work and is unemployed and despite my mom and I sending him jobs to apply to, he doesn't do it. He stays home all day and pretends to work on a ""start up"" that hasn't made progress in years. This has resulted in my family being financially insecure. My parents recently told my sister and I we have to start paying rent. About $400 a month for me, and $300 a month for my sister (even though she makes more money than I do, I have an electric car so I pitch in more to cover the electric bill). Now, normally I would be okay and understanding that I need to help my parents out seeing as I live in the house too, BUT here's where my dilemma is: 

I make much less money now, so on 2 months I was a couple days late with my rent payment. Instead of being understanding, my father came at me with nasty comments blaming their account overdraft on me. This is where I start to get angry. HIS lack of interest in finding a job resulted in my need to help pay the bills, violating a promise they made to me. And I am met with nasty comments and anger when I don't have the money for a couple days and their account overdrafts.

So, I feel like my father's lack of responsibility and disinterest in having a job to support us is taken out on me when I scrape together what little money I have a couple days late for rent, that they promised I would never be asked to pay.

I have been w/ J (24M) for around 2 years.  We took a break a few months ago, we live together & feelings are still there so it’s been complicated.  A couple months ago, I went through his phone and found out he had been cheating on me previous to the break.  K has been there for me, told me I deserve better, & whatnot.  I know I do, but it’s hard to leave.  

Anyways to the point, A few weeks ago I went through his phone again, & saw that he had been sending money to OnlyFans, which is weird because one of the reasons we broke up was because I had an OF acc and he wanted me to delete it because he ""doesn't like OF girls"" I confronted him about it, & he admitted that he had been subbed to K's account & has j***ed off to her content.  I was enraged, and hurt, & jealous honestly.  K is beautifu, hell I find her attractive too, but it hurts because I never even thought my bf was looking at her like that.  We were all friends, and now after this the dynamic just wouldn’t work anymore.  He blocked her on everything.  

I told her the other day (2 weeks after I found out) & told her that because of this, she wasn’t allowed at our apartment anymore, I wanna make it work w/ him, but ugh I don’t even want him looking at her.  I told her she didn’t do anything wrong & it’s not her fault.  We hung up and I thought everything was ok.  Well she has been distant since & today I asked why & she said that she feels violated that he would even do that & feels like she is being punished over something she has no control of & felt I was choosing him over her when I should just leave him.  I replied saying that she knew having an OF would bring anonymous creeps & that I feel more violated bc why would he do that to me, that ik he’s bad for me but I love him. That I love her but I just don't want him to be around her, we could still hang at hers, & I wasn't trying to punish her.

1062,ym6oif,AITA for using my Grandmother's (60 F) credit card and then leaving her alone in her home?,using my grandmothers f credit card and then leaving her alone in her home,"So I (22 you old person) used to do everything in the house. I used to not do so much for her and it all changed when she got diagnosed with cancer. Now before you go and write me in the wrong, I was only there because she needed help and I decided to live there until she recovered. But it came with a price; my sanity. I had two cousins (12 M and 4/5[can't remember exactly] F) that my aunt dropped off every evening since she had to work. When she did, it felt like every evening was absolute hell. They always managed to get into fights and even sometimes I was dragged into situations that I'd rather not be in. 

But nevertheless, I stayed. While I was there, I had fallen in love with my current partner (22 M) and we decided that after our first anniversary, that he should come down for my birthday weekend. My grandmother had no clue about my relationship nor the fact I was using my money to do it. So I did lie to her and told her it was a church meet up at my local church. I had made sure to do a lot of chores (more than I usually do) and sure enough, she allowed. I saved up money past that point from my current job and me and my partner eventually had stayed at a hotel around the town. We had a blast and everything was fine. That was, until my aunt spotted me at the local Wal-Mart with him. We were getting food and other things for the weekend, but I had a nervous feeling and it seems I was right. Lying again, we grabbed the food and left as soon as possible.

When I got home the first day, it seemed like nothing was wrong. So I casually spent my time doing some chores and then went to relax for the rest of the evening. The next day, the entire table flipped over. I came home from work (8 hr shift in the morning, mind you.) and my grandmother and aunt had arrived. They had confronted me about the situation, and soon had taken my laptop, VR headset and personal phone until I admitted the truth. They then gave a stern talking to, but I never got my stuff back and that made me quite angry. 

I was overwhelmed with many emotions; anxiety, anger, sadness, and even some regret. But I couldn't handle it anymore. From day one, I had been treated as a maid in that household and I couldn't stand being treated so rudely. So when my grandmother was asleep, I had grabbed her wallet and used her credit card to buy a bus ticket. I left the exact night, taking only a few things since I only bought for one bag. Many had tried to contact me; close friends, family and other people I had met in the town. I only answered to my brother, whom sided with me since her knew how horrible my grandmother was. 

So, in your humble opinions, am I the asshole?

[Note: me and the grandmother have talked; I am going to repay her and pay for shipping to get my stuff back. Hopefully it can be all good.]",so i you old person used to do everything in the house i used to not do so much for her and it all changed when she got diagnosed with cancer now before you go and write me in the wrong i was only there because she needed help and i decided to live there until she recovered but it came with a price my sanity i had two cousins m and cant remember exactly f that my aunt dropped off every evening since she had to work when she did it felt like every evening was absolute hell they always managed to get into fights and even sometimes i was dragged into situations that id rather not be in but nevertheless i stayed while i was there i had fallen in love with my current partner m and we decided that after our first anniversary that he should come down for my birthday weekend my grandmother had no clue about my relationship nor the fact i was using my money to do it so i did lie to her and told her it was a church meet up at my local church i had made sure to do a lot of chores more than i usually do and sure enough she allowed i saved up money past that point from my current job and me and my partner eventually had stayed at a hotel around the town we had a blast and everything was fine that was until my aunt spotted me at the local walmart with him we were getting food and other things for the weekend but i had a nervous feeling and it seems i was right lying again we grabbed the food and left as soon as possible when i got home the first day it seemed like nothing was wrong so i casually spent my time doing some chores and then went to relax for the rest of the evening the next day the entire table flipped over i came home from work hr shift in the morning mind you and my grandmother and aunt had arrived they had confronted me about the situation and soon had taken my laptop vr headset and personal phone until i admitted the truth they then gave a stern talking to but i never got my stuff back and that made me quite angry i was overwhelmed with many emotions anxiety anger sadness and even some regret but i couldnt handle it anymore from day one i had been treated as a maid in that household and i couldnt stand being treated so rudely so when my grandmother was asleep i had grabbed her wallet and used her credit card to buy a bus ticket i left the exact night taking only a few things since i only bought for one bag many had tried to contact me close friends family and other people i had met in the town i only answered to my brother whom sided with me since her knew how horrible my grandmother was so in your humble opinions am i the asshole note me and the grandmother have talked i am going to repay her and pay for shipping to get my stuff back hopefully it can be all good,547,YTA

On the weekdays he has people who cook and clean but on the weekends I used to do it since he was okay with just eating out and not tidying up which I didn’t like.

His brother has been staying here temporarily for the past month. Things were fine until he made a comment about how I was playing at being a housewife while I was cooking. I told him I wasn’t and he said it was cute which really upset me.

My friend did make his brother apologise to me but ever since I haven’t been cooking or cleaning at all. My friend asked me if I would make a dish he liked this weekend and I told him I wouldn’t. When he asked me why I sarcastically said I didn’t want to play at being a housewife anymore. He got upset and we had an argument because he said his brother had apologised and I shouldn’t let what he said get to me because I knew his brother liked to say stupid things for a reaction. He wants things to go back to normal but I told him it wouldn’t as long as his brother was here.

1075,ym5lch,AITA for lashing out at my sister when she said my husband shouldn't come to our parents house on Christmas?,lashing out at my sister when she said my husband shouldnt come to our parents house on christmas,"

My husband comes from a religious background. I have to say that since my family are non practicing christians, he always criticizes them saying they're hypocrites. and is always uncomfortable spending so much time with them.


The one he doesn't get along with mostly is my sister, He thinks she's living carelessly and irresponsibly. I told him to keep his opinion to himself and told her to ignore him as a compromise.


Christmas is usually spent with family. This year, my sister announced that she wanted to bring her new bf with her for christmas celebration. My husband was rather annoyed by this and said he wouldn't attend this year's christmas celebration if my sister bring her bf. I asked why and he said because it makes him uncomfortable. He told me he'd go if I ask my sister to not bring her new bf.


I went to visit mom and saw my sister there. I brought up the possibility of my husband missing out on this year's christmas celebration and asked her if she'd reconsider bringing her bf. She asked why and I said that it makes my husband uncomfortable. I explained that the family known my husband for years and it's not fair that he misses the event so her bf of 4 months can come. She asked what she was supposed to do and I asked if she'd reconsider bringing her bf, I think he wouldn't care that much about it anyway compared to my husband. She nonchantly said that maybe my husband should not come ""if it's a big deal for him"". I lashed out at her for saying that and told her that she had no respect nor regard for my husband who's a family member and is considered family for years. She had an attitude basically saying it was not her problem. It escalated and mom urged me to go home and I did.


Utter silence on my husband's side, but mom and dad are upset with me for what happened and said that I'm putting unnecesary pressure on my sister and making her feel guilty for the situation my husband created. They suggested I apologize but I said I needed time to see what happens.

Okay, I feel like I should include that a fair number of family (my dad's side) are pressuring my husband to come. They were shocked and upset after they found out he may not be attending.

My friend knew I like coffee so he got me coffee that I know I won't drink.  It's a dark roast and there's no roast by date, which means it's not fresh. 

I gently put it back in the bag and politely told them why I don't drink that kind of coffee.

1089,ym98vw,AITA for wanting to play video games for 30 minutes to an hour every day when I get home from work?,wanting to play video games for minutes to an hour every day when i get home from work,"So I (37m) work as a service manager for a high volume dealer and am out of the house for 12 hours a day (leave at 6 am and don’t get home until 6pm) 5 days a week. My wife (33f) gets upset when I get home and after eating dinner want to get a couple of rounds of COD in. My wife is a SAHM with our 18 month old and thinks it’s absolutely criminal that I want to get some decompress time at the end of the day. My daughter is still in the mommy all the time phase so she prefers to spend more time with my wife than I. Usually when I get home I will eat dinner, do whatever honey-do’s she has for me, and then play for a little. After I’m done I will join them and spend time with my family which usually is her watching a movie/show and I reading the same book to my daughter 10 times lol. My wife says that even when I’m chilling with them I spend too much time on my phone. While we are all hanging out if my daughter is asking for my attention I will stop what I’m doing and do whatever she’s asking me to do. Whenever she wants to go back to mommy I will browse Twitter or Reddit since I usually have absolutely zero interest in what she is watching. She accuses me of being absent/not present since I don’t focus all my free time on her and the baby. Also side note she is currently 20 weeks pregnant. 

So AITA?

Edit: I get up at 5am and usually fall asleep by 930-10pm. My wife and daughter nap through the day so when I’m sleeping they are usually awake for another hour or two.

Edit edit: it has been confirmed that I am indeed the asshole. Thanks for all the constructive suggestions y’all. Time to work on adjusting my mindset .

Edit edit edit: although I do see how I can improve, it does seem like some more background is needed on my home and work situation:

I literally took this job and all that came with it because my wife decided she wanted to be a SAHM. The original plan was for her to go back to work after our daughter was born but during her maternity leave she decided she would rather stay home until our baby was school age. During that time she also decided she wanted another baby. I’ve done everything to try to accommodate her wishes. I took the job, dropped my Jiu jitsu and gym time since I don’t have time to go anymore, and really only have the one hobby now that I can do from home. My wife and I’s childhoods were similar. Raised by single mothers in a low income neighborhood in LA. Now we have a nice home in a very nice part of a beautiful city. I’ve struggled and grinded on my own since I was 17 and am awfully proud of the life I’ve managed to build. My wife has ALWAYS hated gaming, even before the babies. But it’s always been a hobby of mine since I was a kid. I didn’t have a whole lot growing up but I had a Nintendo and instead of jacking around on the street I would come home and play that to stay out of trouble. The people of this subreddit are absolutely merciless. I’ve even received messages on how I’m disgusting, or a piece of trash and should go to hell. That’s insane. My wife picks our 2 family destination vacations every year and on weekends we’re either spending Time visiting her family or going camping. Can I be more attentive? Definitely. Is our marriage/life in absolute shambles? Definitely not. I will always be willing to learn and evolve as a person. I’ve wanted to be a father since I can remember and will always try to be the best one I can, but I’m still human and still flawed.",so i m work as a service manager for a high volume dealer and am out of the house for hours a day leave at am and don’t get home until pm days a week my wife f gets upset when i get home and after eating dinner want to get a couple of rounds of cod in my wife is a sahm with our month old and thinks it’s absolutely criminal that i want to get some decompress time at the end of the day my daughter is still in the mommy all the time phase so she prefers to spend more time with my wife than i usually when i get home i will eat dinner do whatever honeydo’s she has for me and then play for a little after i’m done i will join them and spend time with my family which usually is her watching a movieshow and i reading the same book to my daughter times lol my wife says that even when i’m chilling with them i spend too much time on my phone while we are all hanging out if my daughter is asking for my attention i will stop what i’m doing and do whatever she’s asking me to do whenever she wants to go back to mommy i will browse twitter or reddit since i usually have absolutely zero interest in what she is watching she accuses me of being absentnot present since i don’t focus all my free time on her and the baby also side note she is currently weeks pregnant so  edit i get up at am and usually fall asleep by pm my wife and daughter nap through the day so when i’m sleeping they are usually awake for another hour or two edit edit it has been confirmed that i am indeed the asshole thanks for all the constructive suggestions y’all time to work on adjusting my mindset edit edit edit although i do see how i can improve it does seem like some more background is needed on my home and work situation i literally took this job and all that came with it because my wife decided she wanted to be a sahm the original plan was for her to go back to work after our daughter was born but during her maternity leave she decided she would rather stay home until our baby was school age during that time she also decided she wanted another baby i’ve done everything to try to accommodate her wishes i took the job dropped my jiu jitsu and gym time since i don’t have time to go anymore and really only have the one hobby now that i can do from home my wife and i’s childhoods were similar raised by single mothers in a low income neighborhood in la now we have a nice home in a very nice part of a beautiful city i’ve struggled and grinded on my own since i was and am awfully proud of the life i’ve managed to build my wife has always hated gaming even before the babies but it’s always been a hobby of mine since i was a kid i didn’t have a whole lot growing up but i had a nintendo and instead of jacking around on the street i would come home and play that to stay out of trouble the people of this subreddit are absolutely merciless i’ve even received messages on how i’m disgusting or a piece of trash and should go to hell that’s insane my wife picks our family destination vacations every year and on weekends we’re either spending time visiting her family or going camping can i be more attentive definitely is our marriagelife in absolute shambles definitely not i will always be willing to learn and evolve as a person i’ve wanted to be a father since i can remember and will always try to be the best one i can but i’m still human and still flawed,670,YTA
1097,ym8jcb,AITA For making a joke about my fiance always driving and then getting pissed at him for his reaction,making a joke about my fiance always driving and then getting pissed at him for his reaction,"My fiance (29M) and I (26F) got engaged 3 months ago and are planning our wedding for next summer.   This past weekend we were at a Halloween party with a bunch of my friends.  My fiance has known these people for as long as we've been together.  And while they were my friends first, they've welcomed him into the group just like everyone else.

I dislike driving.  I always have.  I just don't feel comfortable driving in a lot of situations.  Traffic, city driving, highways, driving at night, etc.  All of it gives me anxiety and I hate it.  I can drive to and from my job fine and I'm ok running errands by myself. But other than that I pretty much always make my fiance drive.  Yes, he drove us to the party and he was only planning on nursing 1-2 drinks then switching to water for a couple hours to drive us home.  He's now at a point where he doesn't even ask me, he just assumes he's driving.

At the party, I was talking with a group of friends while my fiance was in the next room with some other people.  I made a joke to my friends that the main reason I agreed to marry my fiance is so that I will never have to drive anywhere ever again.  What I didn't know was that my fiance had just walked into the room and heard my joke.

Instead of thinking it was funny, he said ""Oh, so I'm just a chauffeur to you?""  I told him of course not, but it's just nice that I never have to drive much anymore because he always does it for me.  He said ""Well, guess that will have to change tonight.""  And he slammed the drink he had in his hands and then went to the kitchen and took 2 shots right after another.  A bunch of the other guys at the party thought it was hilarious and started giving him high-fives.  But I was not pleased.

That meant that I would have to either drive us home or we would have to take an Uber, which would be very expensive.  I told him he was being immature and that I was just making a joke.  He said he doesn't find it funny that I made a joke about literally using him as a driving service.  I told him I didn't want to fight about it so I pretty much left him alone for the rest of the night.  I ended up driving us home because he kept drinking after taking shots.  I only had 1 drink the whole night.

On the way home I told him he was acting like a jerk and that it pissed me off that he reacted so poorly to a simple joke.  He said he didn't appreciate me making him the butt of a joke to my friends or to make a joke that minimizes his contributions to our relationship down to him driving me around.  I yelled at him that it was a joke and that now I have to drive us home in the dark when he knows how much I hate it.

He told me he would never make a joke like that and that I would be pissed if he told his friends ""I'm only marrying her so that I never have to cook or clean again.""  I don't think those two jokes are anywhere near the same and I'm still pissed at him for how he reacted.",my fiance m and i f got engaged months ago and are planning our wedding for next summer this past weekend we were at a halloween party with a bunch of my friends my fiance has known these people for as long as weve been together and while they were my friends first theyve welcomed him into the group just like everyone else i dislike driving i always have i just dont feel comfortable driving in a lot of situations traffic city driving highways driving at night etc all of it gives me anxiety and i hate it i can drive to and from my job fine and im ok running errands by myself but other than that i pretty much always make my fiance drive yes he drove us to the party and he was only planning on nursing drinks then switching to water for a couple hours to drive us home hes now at a point where he doesnt even ask me he just assumes hes driving at the party i was talking with a group of friends while my fiance was in the next room with some other people i made a joke to my friends that the main reason i agreed to marry my fiance is so that i will never have to drive anywhere ever again what i didnt know was that my fiance had just walked into the room and heard my joke instead of thinking it was funny he said oh so im just a chauffeur to you i told him of course not but its just nice that i never have to drive much anymore because he always does it for me he said well guess that will have to change tonight and he slammed the drink he had in his hands and then went to the kitchen and took shots right after another a bunch of the other guys at the party thought it was hilarious and started giving him highfives but i was not pleased that meant that i would have to either drive us home or we would have to take an uber which would be very expensive i told him he was being immature and that i was just making a joke he said he doesnt find it funny that i made a joke about literally using him as a driving service i told him i didnt want to fight about it so i pretty much left him alone for the rest of the night i ended up driving us home because he kept drinking after taking shots i only had drink the whole night on the way home i told him he was acting like a jerk and that it pissed me off that he reacted so poorly to a simple joke he said he didnt appreciate me making him the butt of a joke to my friends or to make a joke that minimizes his contributions to our relationship down to him driving me around i yelled at him that it was a joke and that now i have to drive us home in the dark when he knows how much i hate it he told me he would never make a joke like that and that i would be pissed if he told his friends im only marrying her so that i never have to cook or clean again i dont think those two jokes are anywhere near the same and im still pissed at him for how he reacted,585,YTA

I was furious when I found out what happened because Kent wasn't supposed to be giving rides to anyone and decided to race some other guy on a bike and lost control.

 I banned Kent from visiting Ray in the hospital or his physical therapy,and the house. I really don't want this kid around as he's reckless and this isn't the first time he's pulled a dumb stunt like this. 

Usually Ray's dad drops him off and picks him up from physical therapy , but today I picked him because his dad had to stay late for work. When I got there  I saw Kent there hugging him and talking. I got pissed and stormed over and yelled at Ray that it was time to go and I told Kent that I better not see him there again or he'd get sued for damages. Of course on the way home Ray was upset and told me it's not fair of me to treat Kent like that and the he loves him and I reminded him that he' was gunning for a baseball scholarship and that might be all down the drain now since he has to sit out a season and we still don't know how well he'll heal. I  remind him how Kent could have gotten both of them killed and he just got somber and quiet.

Ray went straight to his room when we got home and I talked to my husband about it and he told me that yeah Kent would show up sometimes to help Ray and mad I asked how could he want that boy anywhere around right now and he told me that I have a right to be mad but seeing Kent is keeping Ray positive and helping with his recovery and that maybe I shouldn't have reacted like that.

I called my sister and complained about her behavior and as the argument progressed, she started nit nicking my “crazy standards and pushy rules and forcing her to speak” and saying that I she needs to get settled in Our state first and not to pressure her to talk to strangers so early. I told her that she has no say so in how I run my household and that me pressuring her to speak isn’t an issue since she needs to make everyone feel welcome even if we know her very well.

He found a girlfriend, and they have been dating for about 4 months now. About 3 weeks ago, we were having a text conversation, and he asked me if he was fat and fatter than his girlfriend. I'm like yes, and I said that I was surprised that he managed to reel in a stunning beautiful girl and he was overweight. My friend got mad at me, and then began complaining and accusing me that I think his girlfriend is prettier than him, when he is the prettier one.

My husband has been suffring from health issues for years. They've gotten worse the past 6 months. He's currently in the hospital (5 days now) things don't seem to be getting better and he's on a vent machine.


His mother and I admittedly don't have the best relationship. His condition has severed things between her and I but I keep to myself mostly and make sure to let her have her time with him.


When he first was admitted to the hospital, she tried to go against what I asked her to do. Yesterday, I went home then came back and found out that she poured oil on him. She brought someone from the church and had my husband covered in oil from head to toe (even his hair). I was livid, I got into an argument with her and she argued that she was just anointing him (I heard they do this when they know the patient is going to die) and said that the hospital approved of it so I was lashing out for no reason. I ended up banning her from the hospital which caused a huge blowup in the family. They started calling me cruel and said I can't keep his mother away from him, nor do I own him. also said that she's done nothing that would justify me banning her from seeing and visiting her son.


She is pushing to get access again but I refused to let her come.

The weather forecast predicted the temperatures would drop a bit in my local area but it turns out they ended up dropping considerably more than it had been predicted and they came accompanied by an intense wind that intensified the cold even more. 

This morning, I had to send my nephew to school and I thought that the jacket he had brought from home was not enough for the unexpected cold snap we were facing. So I had an idea: I've got a daughter who is already 18 years old but I still keep her old clothes from when she was my nephew's age, including her old coat and scarf. 

The coat and the scarf are both pink and are decorated with a cutesy floral motif. I gave them to my nephew but as soon as he saw them he threw a tantrum saying that those clothes were for girls and that his classmates would laugh at him if they saw him dressed like that. I told him that, as her aunt, it was my duty to make sure to keep him warm and that I didn't care about what his classmates thought and neither should he. 

It took me a while, but I managed to convince him to wear the coat and the scarf after I told him that if he didn't want those clothes then he could walk outside wearing his puny jacket and check for himself just how cold it was, which he did, and reluctantly accepted to wear the coat and the scarf afterwards. 

A few hours passed and I went to the school to pick him up, he came to me crying. It turns out that he was right, his classmates had made fun of him for wearing those clothes. 

I tried to comfort him but he yelled that it was my fault.

1132,ymamax,AITA for expressing surprise that FIL cared for his gravely ill wife due to his hatred of children?,expressing surprise that fil cared for his gravely ill wife due to his hatred of children,"FIL was not a good father. My husband and his siblings make a lot of jokes about it, I feel to cope, but basically he put every boomer stereotype to shame. He wanted nothing to do with his kids, bitched and moaned if MIL asked him to do anything, hired a nanny so she would stop asking, showed zero physical affection to his son and limited towards the girls, and openly admits he dislikes children. I think he had them because MIL wanted them, but the thing is she didn't. MIL wanted babies and toddlers, so around five they were handed off to the nanny.

FIL claims he loves his kids. I have serious doubts. Anyway MIL was very sick about eight years ago. It was about 6 months before they could find the cause, and she was in and out of the hospital, and FIL did everything for her, pretty much just held her constantly, fed her, brushed her hair, because she was weak to the point she just did not care.

Anyway SIL recently was saying how her dad is an asshole, but she wants a relationship like her parents have and no one is ever going to love her that much. Then she said her mom being ill made her have unrealistic standards for a man. I made a comment about how I was surprised FIL did all of that since he was too selfish to raise his own kids, and it seems so weird to me that he would do things for her that you would do for a child (absolutely no shade I know how genuinely sick she was) when he couldn't be bothered to do those things for his own kids.

Well this got back to MIL and she called me shrieking and demanding an apology. She said I'm an asshole and how dare I compare her to a child being that sick didn't make her ""stupid"" and she said I'm a terrible person.

I’ve never gone on a cruise or left the country so I was super excited. Within the past few months my family has been booking flights, buying drink packages, etc. Last week my mom told me to look at activities to do in-port and let her know if I wanted to do anything. She said that she and my dad would probably not go on any but to still look. I found one and asked my sister (19F) if she wanted to go. She asked if we had to pay and I told her no. No, I did not outright ask my mom if that was the case for that specifically but I assumed because everything else had come at no cost to me to that point. I guess my sister talked to my mom about it. My mom brought it up on the phone earlier. She isn’t super confrontational but she half jokingly asked if I thought that everything I did on this cruise was going to be on someone else’s dime. I was kind of taken back by the question but essentially said yes as this was a Christmas gift. My mom had just gotten done telling me that they weren’t putting up decorations, stockings, or buying gifts. She said they did not originally intend to pay for the excursion but that they would now, without stating a reason, and the conversation trailed off. She didn’t berate me or do anything terrible but I did feel kind of bad after the conversation for having made the assumption. AITA?

1135,ymf9pk,AITA for booking a trip with my cousin versus my boyfriend?,booking a trip with my cousin versus my boyfriend,"The brief background is that I and my BF met through my cousin “Joe”, who is my BF’s high school best friend. So yes my BF is my cousin’s BF if you want to repeat the same joke that’s been going around the family.

My BF “Blake” is and has certain ideas of what is worth his money. A new motorcycle, or a trip out to big sky or a big biking destination are okay, but he has no interest in anywhere else. I barely convinced him to go with me to the beach city my family has been going for generations by pointing out that he didn’t have to wear his helmet on his bike in state. I went on several trips with him, out of my pocket and with my time and effort put into getting a good deal on the plane, car and hotel rooms for us all. But he won’t go where he doesn’t want to, so I figure you can only bring a horse to water and all that. 

The crux of it is that I *love* Vegas. I went a few times when I was younger, another time at 18, and I wanted to appreciate it as an adult that can step on the casino carpet without getting told off by staff. My cousin Joe has expressed interest in going out to Vegas- he’s never really had a chance for a vacation outside of our current region. Blake has previously, when there wasn’t an active attempt to stay in Vegas, expressed a disinterest because he doesn’t like casinos. 

So Joe and I got together and worked on finding a good deal on our flight and hotel room (different beds but same room because why tf not save some cash). We’ve finalized payments and taken the appropriate time off work. We even planned it in my birth month because it’ll be much warmer there than it is here (both of us *hate* the cold)

At dinner tonight with Blake, I was thrilled to tell him about mine and Joe’s plans. He asked to see details and I showed the hotel room pictures, the flight seat arrangements, the couple events we were planning to check out. He stopped reacting and I asked what was wrong and he said “What could be wrong about my boyfriend running off with my best friend?”

That set the tone for the rest of the discussion. I’d say that Blake didn’t seem interested but he’d respond that we never asked *this* time if he wanted to join, knowing that we were planning to go for certain. Then he’d say I was trying to cut him out of things but I’d say that he cut himself out because he never expressed interest but again he said we “never” asked. It went back and forth a lot that way

He’s still talking to me via text but he’s clearly upset with me and my cousin is upset too that we called him knowing he was at work",the brief background is that i and my bf met through my cousin “joe” who is my bf’s high school best friend so yes my bf is my cousin’s bf if you want to repeat the same joke that’s been going around the family my bf “blake” is and has certain ideas of what is worth his money a new motorcycle or a trip out to big sky or a big biking destination are okay but he has no interest in anywhere else i barely convinced him to go with me to the beach city my family has been going for generations by pointing out that he didn’t have to wear his helmet on his bike in state i went on several trips with him out of my pocket and with my time and effort put into getting a good deal on the plane car and hotel rooms for us all but he won’t go where he doesn’t want to so i figure you can only bring a horse to water and all that the crux of it is that i love vegas i went a few times when i was younger another time at and i wanted to appreciate it as an adult that can step on the casino carpet without getting told off by staff my cousin joe has expressed interest in going out to vegas he’s never really had a chance for a vacation outside of our current region blake has previously when there wasn’t an active attempt to stay in vegas expressed a disinterest because he doesn’t like casinos so joe and i got together and worked on finding a good deal on our flight and hotel room different beds but same room because why tf not save some cash we’ve finalized payments and taken the appropriate time off work we even planned it in my birth month because it’ll be much warmer there than it is here both of us hate the cold at dinner tonight with blake i was thrilled to tell him about mine and joe’s plans he asked to see details and i showed the hotel room pictures the flight seat arrangements the couple events we were planning to check out he stopped reacting and i asked what was wrong and he said “what could be wrong about my boyfriend running off with my best friend” that set the tone for the rest of the discussion i’d say that blake didn’t seem interested but he’d respond that we never asked this time if he wanted to join knowing that we were planning to go for certain then he’d say i was trying to cut him out of things but i’d say that he cut himself out because he never expressed interest but again he said we “never” asked it went back and forth a lot that way he’s still talking to me via text but he’s clearly upset with me and my cousin is upset too that we called him knowing he was at work,503,YTA

Well my mom also then asked me since she tends to be very busy and usually takes my sister to stuff if I would take her instead and that I (18F) might like it.

Well I got pretty angry because I DO NOT like Taylor at all, I'm really into hardcore punk and metalcore and emo (and real emo like Sunny Day Real Estate and American Football, not My Chemical Romance crap.) And so I was like ""ARE YOU SERIOUS?"" to my mom and about how I didn't like her and it should be obvious. My mom said that she knew in the past I insisted that I would never ever go to a rap concert (I hate all rap too), but Taylor Swift isn't rap and I like going to concerts...I told her that doesn't matter because she still sucks. The only bands I've seen have been in very small venues or even just basements and full of people moshing and crowd surfing and going crazy, nothing like Taylor Swift! And my mom said even if I didn't like it if she was busy then could I do her a favor and take my sister and my said absolutely not because I'd rather dip my hands in boiling water than go see Taylor Swift and that I'd be too embarrassed at any of the shows I do like to go to if anyone there knew that I actually went to a concert like that. My mom said that I'm being really petty and rude. I explained that not all girls my age like Taylor Swift and she's like the exact opposite of what I like so that's like an insult and I don't want to torture myself at something like that.

Well now my mom seems actually kind of upset at me, but I don't see why she couldn't just take my sister or have her go with a friend if her friend's mom's or sister's are taking them, so am I an asshole?",so after taylor swift announced her new tour dates my year old sister is going crazy and wants to see her and my mom even promised shed try to get tickets for her since her date here is close to her birthday well my mom also then asked me since she tends to be very busy and usually takes my sister to stuff if i would take her instead and that i f might like it well i got pretty angry because i do not like taylor at all im really into hardcore punk and metalcore and emo and real emo like sunny day real estate and american football not my chemical romance crap and so i was like are you serious to my mom and about how i didnt like her and it should be obvious my mom said that she knew in the past i insisted that i would never ever go to a rap concert i hate all rap too but taylor swift isnt rap and i like going to concertsi told her that doesnt matter because she still sucks the only bands ive seen have been in very small venues or even just basements and full of people moshing and crowd surfing and going crazy nothing like taylor swift and my mom said even if i didnt like it if she was busy then could i do her a favor and take my sister and my said absolutely not because id rather dip my hands in boiling water than go see taylor swift and that id be too embarrassed at any of the shows i do like to go to if anyone there knew that i actually went to a concert like that my mom said that im being really petty and rude i explained that not all girls my age like taylor swift and shes like the exact opposite of what i like so thats like an insult and i dont want to torture myself at something like that well now my mom seems actually kind of upset at me but i dont see why she couldnt just take my sister or have her go with a friend if her friends moms or sisters are taking them so am i an asshole,377,YTA
1142,ymev95,AITA for not wanting my fiancee's non binary sibling to be a groomsmen?,not wanting my fiancees non binary sibling to be a groomsmen,"(Using a throwaway and making up names for privacy) My (29F) financee, we'll call him Dan (31M) , and I have been together for three years and just got engaged. He has one sibling, who identifies as non binary. We'll call them Quinn (23). Quinn's parents are alright with it, but don't really understand. Dan dotes on them and they are super super close. 

I like Quinn a lot, and we usually get along pretty well. They're a bit quirky and nerdy, which isn't typically what my friends are like, but they're funny and pretty nice. This I think is important for context. Though Quinn identifies as non binary, they're usually gendered as a woman everywhere we go, since they still have long hear, wear makeup, and are on the bigger side with a pretty big chest and are 5 foot nothing tall. They usually wear men's clothing, but occasionally will wear a dress or a skirt. 

Today I was discussing wedding plans with Dan and he mentioned that Quinn was going to be a ""groomsperson"" and stand on his side and wear a suit. I was a little shocked by this. I figured that Quinn would wear a dress, since they do wear dresses sometimes, and be on my side. Quinn doesn't use a binder and I'm afraid they would stick out and would confuse my older family members, who I haven't even really had a talk with about Quinn yet. When I expressed this to my fiancee he was mad. 

He said it was inconsiderate of me, and that it showed that I think of Quinn as a woman. I really don't, and I don't mind Quinn being a part of that side of the wedding party for all the before wedding stuff, besides like stuff pertaining to the clothes and what not. Like I don't mind Quinn going to the bachelor party and not the bachelorette. I just think it will look weird and cause unnecessary stress and confusion on the day.

I even said Quinn could wear a black dress or flowy pants made to look like a dress, to better for with their style, but my fiancee isn't having it. He said he won't even ask Quinn about it, cause it will upset them.

1145,ymervw,AITA for being upset at the gift my boyfriends ex wife gave to him?,being upset at the gift my boyfriends ex wife gave to him,"My boyfriend (M 33) and I (F 24) have collectively been dating for 1 year. He has an ex wife (F 33) they were together for 10 years and married for 7 of those years. They have not been together for roughly 6 years, yet she is still very much so in love with him. They do have 3 children together and I myself have one child from a previous relationship. Short back story, ex wife lives quite a few states away and only comes up a couple times out of the year to visit her children, she rarely calls and they do not like her due to her pretty much being non existent. She doesn’t even keep them the full time she is supposed to, when visiting with them. I love my boyfriend and I trust him with everything and anything, he is a very good man and father to his children. 
My problem ensues, when ex wife gifts him with eagles tickets for a Philly game, so he will be traveling and going to see them. Now I am very happy for him, and i am not mad at him in the slightest he is very excited and honestly from how hard he works, he deserves it! I did express to him the fact that I am not mad at him but at his ex wife for doing such and thing and for the fact he did say that yet again she has given him the best present he has ever received. She was also placed at the top for something else I do not want to mention, but that did bother me and I let him know that. His ex wife is a very shady person and does not do things from the kindness of her heart but to gain something from it. I feel as if it was a power play to buy his love. Ex wife has been making plans to move closer and has the idea that if she does he will break up with me for her and they can be a big happy family once again. He has told her that would never happen. Now he thinks I am over reacting and we haven’t spoke much since, he also added that i made him regret telling me and me being upset stripped him of his excitement which I did apologize for and explain that was not my intent what so ever, but to share my feelings and I did explain why I felt the way I did. Again his ex wife is a true terror, my boyfriends kids absolutely love me and get excited to see me yet hate their mom and there is very good reasoning behind that. Not to mention that fact again that she is still very much so IN LOVE with my boyfriend and wants to be with him, she is a narcissist at its finest. Maybe I am looking at this one sided, but ex wife does know the eagles is his favorite team, and he has never seen them play in person, I could just be letting my emotions cloud my judgement and possibly overthinking the entire thing. I although really can’t help but to feel she bought him that present to buy his love.
I guess my question would be was I in the wrong to be upset over the situation at hand? Did I over react? How would you feel being put into that circumstance?

1168,ymjqmf,AITA for throwing my shoes at my coworker's desk,throwing my shoes at my coworkers desk,"A little background is that this is my first white collar job. I (26M) previously work as a construction laborer,  fish filleter in a canning industry, and a food delivery rider since I was 18. I really love these jobs as I don't have many problems trying to fit in with people I work with and it has something to do with working with people having the same class as me. I graduated college at 26,  just recently since everything was online  it was easier for me to balance work as a delivery rider and as a college student. I did graduated late because I have two younger siblings and an ill father who needs his eldest son to be responsible at the age of 18. I have no issues with that, in fact, I really love working. 

I got hired in a law firm/industry two weeks ago. The first day I started, I wore a white polo and my black rubber shoes. It was my first time working in an office with cubicles and with people wearing really formal attire.  HR didn't notice anything wrong with my attire though so I thought everything was okay. I have my own cubicle and I love it! I have privacy. Now there are these two guys probably the same age went at my cubicle and introduced themselves and I was really appreciative of that gesture. As I stood up to talk with them, this one guy literally shouted while pointing at my shoes, ""what are those?"", and this other guy repeated the same thing the first guy said. I was confusedly laughing because I thought they were bantering but it turned out to be the other way. It happened the next day, and the following day as well where they also tease me wearing a maroon pants. At this point, I was confused and insecure. I started hating every minute working in this because other person would also laugh at their teases at me. I tried switching up, use my dad's old working shoes but it was huge. He was size 11 and I was 8.5 but i didnt care because i only wanted these guys to shut up about it. What a surprise, they still made a joke about looking like a clown. These guys are straight up bullies, WORK BULLIES at this point. I went to the HR, spoke to the person who brief me the first day, the only thing she said was ""You should get new shoes, and dont wear the same polo everyday"". At this point, im about to consider going back to delivery job. I'm so emotionally drained after what the HR personnel told me.

Yesterday was my 13th day at work, I wore my black rubber shoes and white polo, the same thing I wore my first day. There was a little incident with another workmate where she spilled coffee on her loafers. Now she was upset and worried, these two guys got her loafers that were soaked in coffee, slid it to me on the floor and ask me to wear it to get it dry fast. I had enough at this point and said, ""SURE"", while i removed my rubber shoes and threw it at this guy's desk which made a loud thumping sound that got attention from everyone.

This triggers her instincts and she thinks we're playing. I always let her know when we play and when we don't I properly discipline (I e. I give her a snack on the butt and she lets go) well when she reacts and jumps forward he runs and she chases him. She a kitten and doesn't know better because he does this everytime.

She has had a boyfriend the whole friendship up until 2 weeks ago. He was always nice to me and we got along, but we never hung out unless we were both with her. I was always the single friend. About a month ago, I started to talk to a guy and we recently began hanging out. We have classes together so we see each other then, but now we do stuff like coffee dates, watching a movie, etc. 

When my friend broke up with her boyfriend, I was there for her 24/7. They have broken up twice before (before I was friends with her) and this seemed like another in their pattern—similar circumstances, etc. This past weekend I hung out with my guy once on Sunday before going to dinner plans with her. When she called and asked if I wanted to hang out earlier, I explained I couldn’t because I was with my guy. She got mad and said how today was supposed to be our day. I said that it still was, he wasn’t going to dinner with me and my friend but I wanted to spend a little time with him too. 

All this week, she was guilting me over it and was distant. I didn’t understand why she was mad so I did not go out of my way to spend extra time with her either outside of our typical calls and seeing each other at the house, many times she denied my calls but I figured she was still mad. We finally went to dinner tonight and I put a few hints together that she had been once again, seeing her ex. I asked since when they were a thing again and she said a week (a few days before Sunday—when she went off on me) After talking more she said how every time she denied my call she was in his bed, and she had been with him almost every day this week. 

I really don’t care about her seeing him (like I said, , but I’m upset she hid it from me and let me go a week feeling bad about spending time with my guy when that is exactly what she was doing.

My (F30s) husband (M30s) and I have been married for five years. We have a wonderful relationship and three amazing dogs. We decided a while ago that we didn’t want to have children. Our dogs are good enough for us. In fact, a few months ago we decided to take the next step and my husband and I decided he would get a vasectomy. We thought it was a good idea because that way we weren’t placing the entire burden on me for our birth control. 

However, yesterday my husband and I were speaking and he casually dropped a weird bomb on me. His sister asked him if he’d be willing to donate his sperm so she could have a baby with someone else’s eggs.

Yeah. Right? 

My sister in law and I have a friendly relationship. She and my husband are very close and I often think they cross a line when it comes to boundaries in our (my husband and my) relationship. My husband is someone who wants to please others, often helping neighbors and serving our community. 

On the other hand, I understand why his sister would ask him for this favor, they are really close. Furthermore, my sister in law is unmarried and has been having fertility issues. But to me, once my husband and I made a decision, together, that was final. There’s no guilting me into changing my mind. I don’t want little versions of my husband walking around several years from now hanging around during Christmas and Thanksgiving. I cringe when I think about what that experience could bring, especially when I don’t want to be part of this.

My husbands response? My body, my choice. I unequivocally said, “No fucking way,” and ended the conversation there. My husband said he wants to think about it some more because it’s something his sister really wants. I’ve made it clear that this is a non-negotiable in our relationship. AITA?

Mind you he has barely any kind of scars or skin damage for something like lightning strikes. He has also told us multiple other stories we think are possibly fake. He also has stated he's many different kind of jobs/hobbies including blacksmithing, farming, carpentry, cooking, and much more.

Also, he recently told us about mental disorders he has at ""opportune"" moments. When he first introduced himself he stated that he had anxiety and dyslexia. Couple months pass and a coworker and I are having a conversation about my autism and he suddenly tells us later that week that he also has autism, because he can tell that the rotating part of one of our machines has one side that spins faster than the other (both sides are connected in the middle with multiple poles). Another day he also brought up that he thinks he has DID because when he's interacting with the kid customers at work he gets excited with them like he has a little alter. I don't want to make them upset by not believing them, but it seems very convenient that he brought these up now rather than later.

Last but not least, he has been sick on and off for about a month now and has not gone to any sort of doctor/test to find out why and he's very unhygienic. He has been constantly sneezes, coughs, and blowing his nose every 5 minutes; to a point where he can't really do his job. Many of us including my boss have asked him why and he has said it's due to ""allergies"". I think he either has a cold, the flu, or something worse. He hasn't gone to any doctors or gotten any tests done because he told us he doesn't have the money for it. Along with this, he doesn't seem to take very good care of his looks/hygiene. His hair is usually greasy in some way and can sometimes look like he hasn't brushed it. He smells like he doesn't use much deodorant and apparently only has about one set of clothes he wears to work. Again, I'm worried these things might not be ""fixable"" to him at the moment due to money, but the unhygienic stuff is against our work code.

WIBTA if I confront him about some/all of these things? I feel like they're things I have no place to bother him about, even though I'm in a higher position than him. Should I have HR handle it instead?

TL/DR: My coworker tells us stories we think are fake, possibly lies about having certain mental disorders, and is unhygienic.

1180,ymjcq1,AITA for eating my coworker’s Klondike bars?,eating my coworker’s klondike bars,"I just want to preface this with some context: this did happen a couple of months ago at a place where I no longer work, but it every now and then resurfaces in my memory, and I can’t help but wonder if I am the one at fault.

I’m a nineteen-year-old girl. At the time this incident took place, I was eighteen, fresh out of high school, and had found a job at a local middle school (helping out students in classrooms and supervising the cafeteria during lunch periods). The faculty room had a kitchenette along with a community refrigerator for storing your lunch. Often my fellow staff members would bring in food to share with others (Tubs of Rita’s Italian ice, a grocery store cake to share, bagels, etc). I thought it was very kind and even once anonymously brought in some homemade cupcakes to share.

One Friday afternoon after a particularly long workday, I stopped in the faculty room before leaving for the day to collect my lunch bag and water bottle from the fridge. Out of curiosity, I opened the freezer and saw that there was an unmarked open box of Klondike bars. I love Klondike bars and figured that since there was no note, it would be okay for me to take one. The following week, the box was still there, so I took another (there were still quite a few left).

I left for vacation for a week, and upon returning to work, I was walking through the hallway when suddenly a custodian in what I assume are his mid-fifties approaches me and says, “Hey, you! Do you like Klondike bars?” Startled at the confrontation, I looked at him warily and said, “Yes…I do.” He then asked, “Did you take those Klondike bars in the freezer?” I felt a pang of guilt. “Oh, yes,” I said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t realize they were yours. I thought anyone could have them.” In that moment, I was feeling so stupid and ashamed. He said something along the lines of, “So it was you. I’ve been asking around and some people told me it might have been the new kid. Those aren’t yours. They were mine.” Embarrassed, I apologized profusely and offered to purchase him a new box. He grumbled a thank you and walked away. I felt so shaken up and anxious from the encounter. I thought it was unfair of him to expect me to know the bars were his, as he hadn’t left a note saying so, but I wonder if I really should have been more discerning and realized they belonged to someone. I did buy him a brand new box right after work and put it in the freezer for him the very next day. I just feel so guilty for this still.

I own the place where we lived and she couldn't afford rent on her own, so she quit her job and moved back with her dad in her home state.

She's been looking for a job in her City but salaries are terrible there in her work field so she ended up with a call center job, she's boomed because she'll be earning half her old salary and not using her degree. Well at the beginning of the week she was head hunted for a well paid  job next town to mine and she asked me if I would help and I said yes, she said she could afford rent here with this offer. 

Yesterday right after she signed the contract with the call center, she got the other job and now she expects me to house her and our dog for a few weeks but I can't absolutely do that, I live in a really touristic place and I rented the place for holidays. It told her how I couldn't house her and she lost her mind, she said the only reason she took that interview was because I was going to help her but I never said I could house her I was just gonna drive her and the dog from the airport. She says she needs a few weeks to see places in person because rental scams are a big deal here and is twice as hard to find a place that accepts a dog as big as her's. She also says she can't afford deposit+rent+moving, she'll need at least a paycheck to do it but she had good savings when she left. She's also very angry at me because when I fell in hard times she let me move in with her even though she wasn't ready to live together (we were 4 months in) and how I owe it to her because of that but I believe this is a different thing and I never promised that I would let her move in, just that I'd help her.",me m and my ex f of yearsseparated months ago to both work in our mental health we both werent happy together anymore i do intend on spending the rest of my life with her but right now is not the time for us i own the place where we lived and she couldnt afford rent on her own so she quit her job and moved back with her dad in her home state shes been looking for a job in her city but salaries are terrible there in her work field so she ended up with a call center job shes boomed because shell be earning half her old salary and not using her degree well at the beginning of the week she was head hunted for a well paid job next town to mine and she asked me if i would help and i said yes she said she could afford rent here with this offer yesterday right after she signed the contract with the call center she got the other job and now she expects me to house her and our dog for a few weeks but i cant absolutely do that i live in a really touristic place and i rented the place for holidays it told her how i couldnt house her and she lost her mind she said the only reason she took that interview was because i was going to help her but i never said i could house her i was just gonna drive her and the dog from the airport she says she needs a few weeks to see places in person because rental scams are a big deal here and is twice as hard to find a place that accepts a dog as big as hers she also says she cant afford depositrentmoving shell need at least a paycheck to do it but she had good savings when she left shes also very angry at me because when i fell in hard times she let me move in with her even though she wasnt ready to live together we were months in and how i owe it to her because of that but i believe this is a different thing and i never promised that i would let her move in just that id help her,386,YTA
1191,yminrp,WIBTA if point out my friend's mistakes to their professor?,wibta if point out my friends mistakes to their professor,"Background: I'm an upper level psychology student with a focus in critical analysis. Basically, the skill set I've developed allows me to read journal articles in psychology (and other areas if they aren't too technical) and criticize the pants off of them: pointing out assumptions, shortcomings, and most importantly: confounds.

For you non-psych peeps, confounds can make or break a study.

Recently ""Jimothy"" asked me to pilot his psychology honours study by taking the survey he's built and look for problems. I love the study: it's a good topic, great methodology, and possibly has the potential to get published if he spins it right.

The problem: it has HUGE confounds. I won't get into details

I mentioned them to him but I don't think he's taking them seriously. Frankly, if he doesn't remove them, the results will be tenuous at best, laughable at worst. Not only that, but the findings, which may end up being used by future researchers (who, I will note, would likely not be able to access the materials I've seen to identify the confounds) would contribute false knowledge to science. For those who don't know, this is a huge problem in psychology right now and also a reason I'm so passionate about critical analysis.

I'm considering mentioning my concerns to the professor supervising the study. Usually profs are quite laissez-faire in students' studies and don't look over every detail, but I'm sure she'd agree with me and could convince Jimothy to make the changes before the study launches. 

It wouldn't hurt his grade at all. I'm extremely passionate about the quality of the science produced in my field and can't let something move forward when it actively harms the credibility of psychological research. Nonetheless, this is none of my business and it feels like betrayal.

1199,ymi4vd,AITA for making jokes about my SOs past relationship?,making jokes about my sos past relationship,"I (30F) have been dating my boyfriend Alex (35M) for 6 months. When I went to a bar he’s a regular at, they asked me for my ID which I thought was odd (but not too odd, it just doesn’t happen as often anymore). He then made a comment about how the waitress must have confused me with someone else. When I asked him who, he said the last girl he dated. So naturally, I asked him if she was under 21. It turns out she was 19. Since then, it has bothered me so much. 

When I asked for more information about it, he said that his friend Gary (37M) was dating her at the time but that she (Paula, 19F) was about to be homeless, so his Gary asked Alex if she could stay with him. He said yes, so Paula lived with my bf for almost a year, but after a few months she and Gary broke up. Paula and Alex ended up dating for about half a year while she was living with him. 

I asked Alex if he thought it was wrong that Gary dated her given their age difference, and he said no. I also asked him if he thought it was wrong to date her with the same reasoning, and he said no. 

Personally, I’ve been to bars in college towns at 29/30 and every guy there has seemed like a child to me. Maybe it’s just one of my “values” that dating someone that’s in a much different stage of life than you is wrong. Mostly when that stage of life is barely having lived. 

I’m honestly just so creeped out by this. Ever since I found out, I’ve made jokes as my coping mechanism, but he said that he’s hurt by them, which I understand. Some of the jokes are along the lines of “oh you’re near a high school, your hunting grounds” or “your friend is about to turn 18, you should text her to hang out on her birthday because she’ll finally be legal”.

My gf now “Julie” (27f) doesn’t like me being friends with Bianca. She thinks it’s weird we’re friends. Ig I can’t really summarize how big of a shitshow our breakup was. All my friends told Julie about it. She was really upset when I told her I met Bianca again. I try to be honest bc that was a big tension point in my last relationship so I told Julie that Bianca was my first time really being in love with someone but that I’m with her now and she shouldn’t worry.

And sorry if it’s a little hard to read. I’m still upset

Edit; I pointed out my husband is a good partner in the comments. This situation and for I said is more for when he’s not working cause this happened on his day off. I don’t expect much from him on his working days minus one diaper change

For context; I(F22) and my husband(M26) just had a baby three months ago. I’m a SAHM and he works to provide for us. I don’t get much ‘me time’ and we just got into an argument so I feel bad. That’s why I’m here. 

So me and my husband woke up today and he went and did errands while I stayed home with the baby. He came home and told me I can play apex for a few hours on the pc while he watches the baby. I was 100% on board with this since I haven’t played in awhile without having to worry about the baby.

So I was playing the game and while doing so he kept saying things in a joking manner like for example; my aim is bad, I’m blind for not seeing the other player, I really gotten bad at playing games all of a sudden and what happened. Stuff like that. Usually it doesn’t bother me cause I really don’t care but the jokes were more often than usual and I gotten upset with him. I told him I would still be good if I had the opportunity and time to play more but I don’t since I have to watch the baby all of the time while he just comes home from work to play the game and then sleep or get on with his friends. Told him we don’t spend any time together either of just the two of us. Or even to chill with the baby. You just work, sleep, eat, play. And a bunch of other little petty things. 
So he didn’t say anything other than to tell me to be quiet and to shut up(playfully). But then a few minutes later he texted me to take the baby and to get off. 

He got off the phone with his friends on discord and that’s when the argument happened. He said “I shouldn’t have never said any of our personal life on the phone with his friends. I embarrassed him. His friends think he’s probably a shitty father and husband now and that he doesn’t do anything. Which isn’t true you know how I am and I say things jokingly to you and my friends. And if I’m so unhappy I can just leave. You know I’m trying my hardest to give you some time but it’s hard when you are the only one working and have the financial burden on you”. Then I started again with saying how I never get alone time with him or me time. I was just upset that he kept doing it. And how I just wanted to play and not have that in my ear. Since I never get to play really and this is how women after birth get really depressed because it’s the baby 24/7. 

He left the room after that and just texted me he hates me and that he wished I didn’t say that stuff cause he feels embarrassed and awful. And if I’m so upset we should just talk and figure things out

I NEEDED this job due to circumstances with my daughter's after school. Working from home was the only solution at the time and I think I'm incredibly lucky to have found this job when I did.
Recently, we received two new coworkers. We were stoked because the night crew really needed more help. We were overworked, tired, and a few were (maybe still are) planning to quit. One was being trained by the same person as me, let's call them Book, and the other was trained by someone from a different team entirely, we'll call them Brat. They're a couple in their 30s.  We know that they are from a religious cult that one of the higher ups are in and got the job off of his recommendation.  We didn't want to scream ""Nepotism"", but it became obvious when the higher up wanted to bring Brat in at a higher rate than anyone else because he had to drive to get to the office. (Most of the staff have to drive and Brat is also currently working from home)
Book's work plummeted and odd behavior started to happen. Emails sent when neither of them were supposed to be on the clock, mainly Brat (this is illegal in my state). Came in hours before their shift to put their tags on the easiest orders. Huge problems in customer's orders that caused a lot of returns and extra work for everyone. They don't email, call, or message anyone so we're all left picking up the pieces. Mainly me and coworker, Toro. I've had to stay hours past my shift going into their work and fixing things that were day 1 lessons. I had numerous talks with the manager because now it's affecting my health. 
Their disregard for the schedule has caused us to scramble in certain areas and their mistakes and refusal to fix them has caused stress and extra work. I decided enough was enough and started messaging them directly. This was done to me many times when I first started and led to a lot of growth on my end. Brat started questioning why I was being ""unprofessional"" and talking about their hours despite the way it's hurting everyone being outlined for them. Emails that I would be working would disappear only to turn up in the archive or deleted folder. They would say they knew their schedule and, in the same text, give the wrong hours. If one of them is told that their shift is up, then both of them will leave, despite their shifts being different.
Toro and the trainer, Kam, who taught Book and myself, and both of the team managers agree that I haven't done anything wrong. Toro and Kam say I shouldn't be staying as late as I am cleaning up after them. I should just put Book or Brat's tag on it and leave it in the box.
I'm not their boss. I'm just tired and this job isn't the best and now I have to constantly fix orders each night because if not all the work won't be ready for the morning crew.

1212,ymkq2q,AITA for yelling at my dad at the airport for being so last-minute and making everything stressful?,yelling at my dad at the airport for being so lastminute and making everything stressful,"I (18f) am traveling to Germany from California with my dad to visit some of his cousins. I am the kind of person who overworries and goes to the airport at least 3 hours beforehand for international flights. My dad is the opposite, he’s very relaxed.

I had told him in the morning that I wanted to leave early for the airport especially since security lines have recently been very long. He said ok that’s a great idea but then screwed up several things that annoyed me greatly. He left packing to the last minute, realized he didn’t have some things and then needed to stop by Target. Then he somehow messed up calling the Uber because he had marked the wrong geolocation on the map instead of typing in the actual address.

As I predicted, the lines in the airport security for checking in luggage and security were long. Despite seeing this, my dad had a laid-back “it’ll all work out, don’t worry, why are you so stressed?” attitude and even STOPPED for coffee at one of the vendor shops. Wtf.

It made me so angry and annoyed so I just ignored him so I could cool off. He kept asking me what was wrong, why I’m giving him the silent treatment and glaring at him, so that’s when I burst and started yelling at him to shut the hell up and leave me alone. Not my finest moment and i could tell this hurt him so I tried to be more calm. I said he always causes things to be more stressful than they have to be and is always a pain in the ass to go anywhere with. I told him if he wasn’t so dense, he would see that his actions actually impact others and cause them major stress and anxiety. After this, my dad gave a brisk apology but is now effectively giving me the silent treatment and I can tell he is majorly upset.

my younger sister has always disapproved of this couice. Shes tried to set me up with men multiple times and every time I tell her im not interested.

Shes been married before so she doesn't really care about the experiences, she is just very in love with her fiance which is fine by me.

I ignored her and she took my hand and I honestly thought she was going to kiss it and apologize, but she took my ring off my finger and said ""much better.""

I grabbed it back from her and I know this wasnt the best thing to do but I was worked up and i yelled at her, I said ""Never do that again you hear me!?"" and she said it was just a joke and i yelled again and said ""NEVER DO THAT AGAIN"" and she said ""ok i wont jeez"" and everyone went quiet.

I have two nieces(Sasha and Nora) who both graduated from highschool this year. In my family we don't throw college parties. The only times someone throws a college party is when they get accepted in a good college.

Sasha got accepted in a good college but Nora is going to community college

The problem started when both my sister and sil(their moms) decided to throw the parties in the same day. The parties are also in two different towns so no way we can attend both. I don't know why but none of them would change the date. Eventually I ended up going to Sasha's party as she is the one who got accepted in a good college and like everyone else in our family who did the same she desrves to have her party. 

Turned out I wasn't the only one who thought so and almost everyone in our family has decided to come to Sasha's party.

Nora's mom was extremely angry. She called all of us and yelled at us and said we are assholes

It has been months and she still mad and not talking to anyone

Edit: do me a favor and tell me how I could NOT be the asshole her because how I see it my only options were

1. Go to Sasha's party which everyone clearly thinks was the asshole move

2. Go to Nora's party which I don't see why it would be any different than going to Sasha's

3. Cut myself in two pieces and send each piece to each party which seems like what everyone is suggesting

Edit: I see a lot of projection in the comments. So because we didn't go to Nora's party we have been neglecting her and favoring Sasha their entire lives? Where did you even get that from? 

And do you really believe that two achievements that are not equal should be equally celebrated? Both girls play sports so if Nora's team won and Sasha's team became 9th should we celebrate both of them equally?

My wife and I were invited to my brother's 31st birthday. He's single and lives alone in his apartment.

So to give you the headsup, my wife and him don't get along so well. But can be civil enough to sit at the same table.


So, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore.


We got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for ""getting in her face about it"". She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan.


At home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it.


EDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable.

1238,ymrcwz,AITA for complaining about an old lady that took my seat so I wouldn't have a row to myself on a 7 hour flight?,complaining about an old lady that took my seat so i wouldnt have a row to myself on a hour flight,"I was flying to Asia on AirAsia. Flight length is 7 hours.  The setup is 3-3-3, 3 seats on the sides, and 3 on the middle aisle.  Most people have their seats setup so it's x-o-x, 2 people in each row, with a space between them.  

I get lucky and have a row all to myself o-o-x.  But i didnt want to take a chance to move so i put all my stuff in my seat pouch (tablet, water bottle, phone, earphones).  

During takeoff I stay in my assigned seat, then when the seat belt light goes off I put on my earplugs and eyemask and lay down.  

About 30 minutes in someone taps my leg, I wake up and reposition in the middle seat.  It was an old Asian woman that immediaately sat down in my original assigned seat when i got up. I thought she was sitting down to let people pass her by, but she stays there and starts putting her purse under the seat and water bottle in the seat pouch (my stuff is still inside).  

She gestures for me to move to the other seat. I'm just confused, and stare at her for a good minute thinking what is going on.  

I call the help button. A crewmember comes and I explain that the woman is sitting in my assigned seat and the the other seats in the row were not occupied, so its obviously not her assigned seat, so I'm asking him to tell her to leave.  He says that since I moved seats she can too.  Visible confusion just radiates from my eyes.  At this time she didn't say anything to this crewmember.  

She gestures for me to move over to the other aisle seat again so it's x-o-x, but I tell her no. So I decide to just play hardball and get my tablet from her seat and start watching movies.  Another 20-30 minutes go by and they start serving drinks.  She gets a drink and starts having a long conversation to a different crewmember.   

Idk what they said, but she chugged her drink, took her stuff (I was watching if she was trying to steal something) and left. Never saw her again. She wasn't even in the vicinity when I went to the bathroom, no idea where she came from.  

When she left I laid down and went to sleep.  So AITA for not moving over to share the row with this woman?

Edit:  

1) I described her as old Asian lady trying to describe  a language and cultural barrier. I'll describe myself as young Asian-american man that doesn't speak their language.   

2) The flight seemed about 60-70% full. Like I said most rows were x-o-x, but some people had rows to themselves like me.  I don't know what the lady's seat was since I didn't see her in the vicinity and didn't see her again.  I didn't see any rows near me that were full x-x-x.    

3) I laid down on the row. Someone tapped my leg, I got up because I thought it was crew telling me to put on my seat belt. It just happened that when I sat up I ended up in the middle seat. Before I had the chance to say or do anything the lady took my seat without saying anything. I did not willingly move to the middle seat. I just sat up and she took it, so even if I wanted to move to my assigned seat, I couldn't because she was there.  

4) I was really confused at first why people were saying I moved. Now it makes sense. Reread edit 3).  I did not move to the middle seat, I was lying feet on my assigned seat, torso on middle seat, head on other aisle seat.  When I sat back up, my butt rolled into the middle seat, and as soon as I did the lady took my seat.

1240,ymohfm,AITA for telling my hyper-critical friend that not everyone wants a doormat man like her husband?,telling my hypercritical friend that not everyone wants a doormat man like her husband,"I have a friend, Kelly, who hates everyone's boyfriend without exception. She has a problem with all of them and keeps telling the girls in our friend group that they should break up and find better men. 

Her husband is apparently perfect and she almost always brings up something great about him. Truth is, her husband is a very sweet man, but he is a doormat and just does everything Kelly tells him to. For example, if we have a girls night out and Kelly doesn't feel like taking the bus home, she will call her husband at 2 am, wake him up, get him to come pick us up and take us ALL home to different parts of the city. 

So yesterday, when our other friend Page was venting a bit about her boyfriend being bad with finances, Kelly of course had to chime in saying how that's really not okay and even though her husband came from a poor background just like Page's boyfriend, he never made her pay on dates and such. 

At this point I was already a bit tipsy and jokingly told Kelly that yeah, we know her husband is a perfect little puppy, but has it ever crossed her mind that not everyone wants a doormat man like her husband?

Kelly didn't take it well and told me to never call her husband that again, because being ""loving and kind"" doesn't make a man a doormat (I could only roll my eyes at that... )She got all high and mighty about it and I expected the 2 other girls present to be on my side, but they weren't. 

They just said some diplomatic bullshit about Kelly's husband being very sweet and that I shouldn't call him a doormat and changed the topic. 

Kelly ended up leaving early and right as she left, the two other girls jumped at me asking me what's wrong with me and telling me I should apologize to Kelly. 

... how is it okay for Kelly to criticize each and every one of our boyfriends, but the first and only time I say something about her husband, I'm an asshole and I should apologize? Isn't that bullshit?

1241,ymw8r6,AITA for crying and asking my boyfriend to leave over a burger?,crying and asking my boyfriend to leave over a burger,"I (21F) recently found out I’m pregnant (woo…/s) getting to the 6 month mark, it’s a complicated pregnancy and I’m exhausted.

My boyfriend (28) moved in with me because of it, it wasn’t expected but we’re making do. I’m training to be a teacher and he’s currently looking for employment, technically I’m working two jobs to support the both of us it’s tiring, but he’s looking so it’s not over that.

There’s a local burger place I’d been wanting, we rarely go but I’ve been having cravings - they shut at a certain time.

He agreed to it, he agreed to ordering since they only have one veggie burger I like, it’s not as though there’s multiple things I can have.

They shut at 9, I got home at 840 and he hadn’t ordered and by the time he went to it was too late, I started crying because I’ve been craving that all week and all I wanted was a burger and a hot shower, I couldn’t even have a shower since he used the last of the hot water.

He didn’t apologise and offered to go Burger King, which I didn’t want and he got all silent claiming I’m being an AH since he’s been job hunting all day (as I see it my day started at 6am and ended when I got in bed at 930, his day started at 9am and ended at 930, but I’ve got the extra weight of pregnancy) we got into an argument about how we’re comparing days and that he’s overwhelmed.

 I asked him to leave, because I don’t like arguing and he had to stay in his car since he moved in with me (away from friends)

He argued that I’m blowing it out of the window because I’m pregnant and not considering his feelings, because he’s overwhelmed, so am I?  My friends say I’m the AH because he’s probably in over his head, and had to sleep in his car over a burger.

AITA?

I let them eat as much as they wanted over the past few days but the other night I decided I deserved a little treat and helped myself to some of their candy. Unfortunately I got carried away and ended up eating most of it.

Yesterday after school my kids came home and I told them what happened. They were both extremely upset but I said they had been given several days to eat their candy and that it wasn't unfair of me to eat some of it myself. They are still sulking about it and my wife is siding with them and telling me I should go out and buy them more candy.

I don't see any problem with what I did. I pay the bills so I feel it's reasonable for me to get a share of the candy. I'm also not a fan of the disrespectful way they talked to me after they found out what happened.

1249,ymzaep,AITA For refusing access to my financial accounts and asking for a prenup?,refusing access to my financial accounts and asking for a prenup,"Me(26m) and GF(24f) have been together for 6 years and we have planned on getting married for over two years now, but we postponed any of those plans due to not being able to have a wedding due to COVID spreading everywhere and us having no money to afford a wedding/rings anyways.

We have been living paycheck to paycheck since my career was just starting off in low pay entry positions and she only gets a small stipend from her university. I ended up being laid off two months ago, so she has been supporting me by paying for food/necessities with her small stipend while my best friend has been paying my share of the rent and the entirety of our other bills. Because of them, I was able to focus on finding a great job where I'm now making 6 figures. My best friend was elated, but GF on the other hand didn't believe this was real. This changed as soon as she saw me filling out my employment forms.

Once she understood this was real, she began talking about all the different things she wants to blow my money on. Luxury handbags, jewelry, clothes, new phone, etc. I'm now expected to pay her share of the rent from now on. I just shrugged off those conversations and changed the subject. Now, we're back on the topic of marriage since we're now in a good financial position to do so and it would be in our best interest for tax reasons, but our private discussion blew up into a whole clown fiesta in our shared apartment and everyone is involved.

Her demands for marriage were that I give her access to all of my bank accounts. Not just the joint account that I would contribute to (mainly for bills) or the spending account that I planned on funding so she could enjoy her life with a reasonable amount of expendable income. She wanted all of them. My demands were that I would keep my main bank account private, as well as my crypto and stock accounts. I also asked for a prenup that would separate our marriage from my business. I will maintain full ownership and full liability for any debts in the event of a divorce.

Hearing my demands for marriage triggered GF emotionally, as she immediately ran upstairs and began asking everyone there if prenups were a real thing that Americans do. She then starts trash talking American culture, making accusations that I'm going to keep a hidden account to fool around behind her back and telling everyone that I have been poor for the entirety of our relationship while she supported me. To be fair, her PARENTS supported us both for a year and then my parents supported us by letting us live with them rent free for two years.

Everyone else who was here at the time gave their opinions and tried comforting GF. They sympathized with her and tried their best to explain my point of view. A few friends are completely on my side, some say that we both have valid viewpoints, some say that I am wrong because I made GF feel insecure.

AITA for telling her I would not give her access to ALL of my financial accounts and asking for a prenup?

&#x200B;

Edit with relevant info: The prenup only effects OWNERSHIP of my business. GF would still be entitled to my personal assets and income. The business is not successful yet either. Should it fail and I end up in massive debt, the prenup would protect GF from being left with half of it.

GF is not giving up her future to be a housewife. She is currently a PhD student and has a bright future even without my help.

I don't intend to hide my finances. She would be able to look at them at any time by asking me.

1253,yn3cxw,AITA for using the wrong towels?,using the wrong towels,"This feels like such a silly issue to be posting here, but here goes.

My wife and I, both mid 30s, have been remodeling our home a bit. I've been doing the painting upstairs and sometimes spill a bit and when I do I try to clean it up as fast as possible. The linen closet is upstairs so I just run to that and grab out a few towels and don't really pay attention to what I'm grabbing as long as it can wipe paint up.

My wife is kind of crazy when it comes to towels lol. She's got different ones for different uses, hair, hands, face, body, decorative, general cleaning, even old ones that are paint and grease covered but been washed, etc... so she gets upset that I use whichever towels to clean paint spills instead of the ones she has dedicated to stuff like this. 

Her complaint is, some of the towels I use are kind of pricey and have a certain purpose and I'm ruining them by using them to wipe up paint. And some she only has limited quantities of. I say, towels are towels, they're all basically the same and are replaceable, so she can use the joint account and buy more of her towels because I'm not going to waste time looking for specific towels when there's paint on the floor I need to clean up.

1257,ymwy8i,AITA for trying to sell my late wife's motorcycle?,trying to sell my late wifes motorcycle,"My wife was a biker and worked as motorcycle mechanic with her brother. She used to  ride her dad's old Harley.  Ive always hated motorcycles and  thought  they were death traps. I would try to get her to sell it ,but she always ignored me. She died when she lost control on some ice coming home one day. Our son Joshua(19M) was about 13 when she died and it hit him hard especially since she used to take him riding with her all the time.

I planned on selling the bike then not long after the funeral not wanting to see it anymore. When I went to look for it in the garage after getting a buyer set up  I find out the bikes gone and apparently Joshua and my BIL took the bike over to his place. I  got mad and asked why they took the bike knowing I was planning on selling it and they told me I had no right to sell a family heirloom and after some arguing I said fine and just said I didn't want to see it ever again. So there it remained over at my BIL's garage. That's what I thought anyways until Joshua turned 15 an apparently my BIl took him to go get his motorcycle license without telling me. 

I caught him riding it home one day and he told me. I was furious asking why he would want to ride the thing after what happened with his mom and he just kinda shut down. I  tried to bar him from riding and I took the keys from him ,but he'd constantly steal them back and go riding anyways. I just stop trying at that point amd he's been riding it ever since even after I got him a car.  He still lived with me while he's in school and just drives everywhere on that motorcycle even driving his boyfriend around on it.

Last week they got into an accident on it, just some minor scraps and bruises thank god , but I was terrified and  I decided to try selling it again hoping he'd realize how dangerous it is. When a guy came to look at it Thursday  Joshua came home early and was pissed when he found out.  He screamed at the guy to f off and that the bike wasn't for sale. I tried reasoning with him telling him I didn't want to loose him like I lost his mom and that she literally died on that same bike. He yelled at me that he didn't care and  rode off.  I got a call from my BIL later telling me that Joshua had confided in him that riding was how he felt close to his mom an that I was being asshole trying to take that away from him and I should just let it go already.

1263,yn5br1,AITA for keeping the same financial agreement with my wife?,keeping the same financial agreement with my wife,"I(31M) recently completed my PhD and a postdoc position. I didn't make much money during that period, about 26k annually for my PhD, and about 32k while I was working as a postdoc. My wife(30F), who I married about when I got my PhD, makes a shitload more than me, or made a shitload more than me. She made about 100k while we were together, so quite a bit of a gap. She also came up with the idea that we should put some of our income for ourselves and some for the family, and this would be proportional to our income, to keep it ""fair"".

She always got a bit fancier stuff than me, and I was pretty jealous. I didn't voice it to her, which I guess should've, but I don't understand how she doesn't realize it.

I don't want to reveal too much information, but while I was working as a postdoc, I made connections with a couple people who were starting up a company. Long story short, last year I made 300k without including my stake in the company. It is obviously risky, but I think the risk had paid off for me at least.

I did get a Tesla Model S, which I am entirely paying with my own money, including the insurance. And I'm starting to buy more expensive stuff for me too, and it honestly feels amazing.

Now, she is asking if we should just combine our incomes, and each get the same amount of ""our money"", which feels like total bullshit. She wants to eat her cake and have it too. And I just said no, she wasn't being fair. She then went on a spiel about equity, which I honestly did not listen to. I mean, she is allowed to make that suggestion, but I am allowed to say no, right?

We are both currently looking for better jobs and/or something cheaper, but it is what it is right now.

My mom and wife share a birthday and there aren't words for how much my mom hates this. There was lots of whining in the beginning, jokes about can't I just get a new girlfriend, and as of right now she does her best to avoid my wife the entire week of the shared birthday. 

Outside of that she is a decent MIL, mostly pleasant to her but their relationship is surface level, and they could both do without the other. My mom is currently at home recovering from surgery from a torn ACL so she isn't doing much this year, though my dad got her cakes, food, and easily thousands of dollars worth of presents. 

My wife has been feeling pretty down due to our living situation and some external factors and I wanted to cheer her up. I asked my dad if we could have some people over. He said yes, but to be fair I didn't specify it was for a birthday party, I'm not sure he even remembered it was my wife's birthday as he is totally disinterested in her, and he was in the middle of doing stuff for my mom who was acting very princessy about her surgery.

I invited our closest friends and set up a nice little party for my wife. At some point my mom did come down and realize what was going on. I saw her look to the decorations and cake and she looked pissed. My dad quickly ushered her away and promised they would go out when she was better, but she said it wouldn't count. My dad came back out and muttered to me that I'm an asshole for doing this and called me insensitive and a mooch. He came out an hour later and shut the party down as he claimed we were being too loud. I don't think we were, but it was getting late so I didn't mind too much.

My wife loved it and had a great birthday. I fully intended on cleaning up myself but was too tired to do it that night. My mom came down in the morning and saw the things still up and got pissy again. I was in the process of cleaning them and told her not to worry I would take care of it. She just glared at me and stormed off. My dad came back down and berated me for throwing it in my mom's face that my wife got a birthday party and she didn't, and told me he can't stand me and can't wait for us to leave. I told him they are both being crazy and my mom doesn't own the date. He shot back that I tricked him as he didn't realize it was  a birthday party, to which I laughed and said maybe he should know his own DIL a bit better. He complained to some family and now my aunt and her husband are calling me an asshole as well.

ETA to be clear about the mess. My mom only cared because she saw birthday stuff. She has never in her life cared about a mess. She once threw a handful of glitter in her own living room.

My husband (27M) has always wanted a family. We compromised and decided to use a surrogate, but I ended up pregnant before we could put our plans in motion. My husband was very hesitant - his mother shared similar views to me on pregnancy and their relationship is very sour because of it. We both went to therapy, individually and together, had a lot of talks, and we decided to go through with it.

I'm warming up to a lot of this, but one hard boundary for me is I don't want people touching my stomach. It's even hard at the doctor's office but I do it because it's for the good of our child. I've articulated this boundary to my husband and even though it was upsetting to him, he respects it, for my benefit.

I've been feeling baby kick for about 3 weeks now, but I haven't told my husband about it. I'm just afraid that he would push the boundary or feel left out, so I've just been keeping it to myself.

We've rarely been able to go to appointments together, so Thursday was the first in several weeks we were able to attend together. My husband mentioned he was worried that I was so late in pregnancy without feeling any movement and the OB got very concerned, asking me if I ""felt the kicks dropping off."" I told her no, everything was fine, and even though my husband didn't say anything, I could tell he put everything together.

He was silent for the rest of the appointment and the whole ride home. He asked why I lied to him and I told him just what I said here. He accused me of not trusting him to respect my boundaries and said he needed to stay at a friend's that night. He came home yesterday and apologized for leaving but said it was a very serious violation of his trust. He even told me ""If you can't be honest about this, how do I know you'll be honest when you're in labor? Or if something bad happens?"" That felt harsh to me. Those are real emergencies. This wasn't.

He says it is hard for him already to know he has been completely shut out of the bonding process - which I don't think is fair at all - and that being treated like this has upset him further. I felt that he was exaggerating. I talked it over with my mom and she agreed that I was harsh to him and should've at least let him feel once and told him when it was happening, so he could feel included. That's too much to me. I don't feel comfortable putting the boundary down at all and I feel like that gives him the opportunity to push it.

Was I in the wrong? Am I being outrageous?

AITA for not telling my husband when our baby was kicking?

EDIT: This has blown up way more than I expected and it's given me a lot to think about. I just wanted to touch on everybody - particularly all the women - who have come on this post telling me that clearly I didn't try hard enough to not be pregnant. For a *decade*, I have begged for sterilization and have been told by every doctor, ""What about your future husband?"" When I had a husband who vouched for me, I was told, ""You'll change your minds."" I was on birth control and it failed, which happens to hundreds, if not thousands of women. I didn't want to use condoms with my *actual spouse*, sue me. Termination is legal in my state, but I didn't feel safe or comfortable going through with it. It is so easy, before you have been in that position, to say what you would do, but to actually go through with it is 10x harder. The question isn't, ""AITA for going through with a pregnancy?"" so stop picking apart my reproductive decisions like it has any impact on your life.

1283,ynel9u,AITA for not letting my wife go out with her friend,not letting my wife go out with her friend,"I'm gonna try to keep this short because I'm not the greatest at describing things to be honest with you. 

I'm a Male, 40 years old, and my wife is Female and 42. We've been together for just over 20 years, married for 16, and have 2 children, 14 and 10. 

Never once in the 20 years we've been together was anything like this discussed, agreed upon, or done. Never did either of us said this kind of thing was okay to do, and I don't know where she got that idea from. 

A couple days ago, my wife came up to me and talked about a ""trip"" she's going on. I already knew this trip was happening, it's been planned for a while. She's basically staying in a hotel with one of her girl friends for a week. 

But now all of a sudden she said that her friend bought tickets to a male strip show. Which was never discussed prior and was suddenly put on my just the other day. 

She said her friend bought her and my wife both tickets to go to a bar and watch a male strip show together. She didn't come to me asking if it was alright, she just said ""we bought the tickets and we're going."" 

She was laughing and acting like everything was just fine. Even though I've never indicated I'm comfortable with that kind of thing. 

I personally think it's a super inappropriate thing for a married woman to do, especially without asking prior to buying tickets. 

Well long story short I yelled at her and told her I wasn't okay with it. I told her it was inappropriate and she couldn't go. She got super upset with me and said that I'm being controlling and I should ""let her have fun."" 

Her (almost) exact words were ""wow, I thought you'd find it funny but now you're freaking out. It's not like I'm having sex with someone else. I'm an adult I can do what I want."" 

Today I told her I don't want her going on the trip with that friend at all, and if she does she needs to cancel the tickets and promise me she won't go to the bar. But she refused to promise anything and yelled at me for being ""a jerk"" in front of our kids. 

AITA for telling her not to go and getting mad?

Onto the problem: yesterday Sam & I wait in the lobby for the elevator. A woman is also waiting. Recently he saw KungFu Panda for the 1st time & is obsessed (Po for Halloween) pretends 2 karate chop everything 2 “save China” -hilarious. He never really hits anyone tho.

Sam runs up 2 her with a big “hiyah!” & makes a karate pose, this lady just scowls at my kid. She scowls at me & turns away before I have the chance 2 even smile at her or anything. I catch up 2 Sam & he says something like “I’m Po! I know karate!” trying 2 engage her & she just flat out ignores him. I’m about 2 say something 2 her when Sam starts pretending 2 karate chop her legs, not even touching her, I pull him back. Not fast enough cuz Sam barely brushes her skirt & she snaps at him “DONT TOUCH ME.” Not a yell but really sharp & mean. I pull Sam close & tell him its ok & ask the woman whats her problem. She said “Im not here to entertain your kid” or smth like that, again really snappy tone! I’m stunned at this point I’ve never met someone so rude. I’m not making Sam share an elevator with her (he wasn’t crying but quietly staring/clearly uncomfortable) so I pick him up 2 carry him up the stairs. Then I say “there’s no need to be such a B-I-T-C-H” (spelled out) because honestly she needed to hear it. This woman whips her head around at me & I see her face go from angry to smug as she looks from me to my kid and back to me and loudly says “B-I-T-C-H spells BITCH.” (NOT spelled out!)

She did this to me on purpose.

Srsly!) Over the past 2 hours as Sam keeps saying Bword fiancé has been going from not caring at all/laughing at me to being angry at me and BLAMING ME for “teaching our son a bad word.” We arent that household that thinks its cute when kids swear and all that trashy stuff. I admit I had a hand in this but I was only defending myself & my kid & I wasnt the one who was actually rude & teaching Sam bad words.

Heidi sent out email invites to everyone with a link to the registry and there was about 3 paragraphs repeating over and over that she will only take gifts that are off the registry and that nothing else is acceptable, which I thought was kind of entitled but oh well.

I only have one younger sister (almost 19) and I provide everything for her and have taken her responsibility as my parents won't. From housing to college tuition to miscellaneous expenses, I bear them all.

She recently got admitted in a college that's far off from our house. It takes her 4 hours of travelling by public transport daily to commute to and from the college. 

I decided to find a place for her near college (she won't live on campus because the quality isn't good). She asked me to stay with her and help with her dogs for a few initial months and I agreed. 

Househunting is a nightmare where I live, especially for single women. I've been spending hours finding a ""nice"" home for her. 

My sister is always open to me about relationships etc. But today, she lied to me about visiting a friend (really elaborate lies) and instead went to see someone else. I believe it's a guy she's dating that she went to. 

I feel so hurt that she would lie to me about such a petty thing and for some reason, I'm just feeling like not doing the house hunt for her anymore.

I want to know if I'm overreacting and if I'll be the asshole for not doing this for her? I don't want her to be in inconvenience but I just don't feel like doing it anymore.

Edit: Just want to add that my sister is really supportive in general and helps around the house a lot.

Edit: I just want to appreciate all the people here. You might not know this but every single insight has been giving me more to think about and really making me see things I didn't see earlier. This will help me discuss the proper issue with my therapist instead of being vague.

Yesterday, I was at work and came home and found that she'd done my husband's laundry. I was stunned as I felt this was...not her place nor was it appropriate because for one I always do his laundry and more importantly, I did not think it was appropriatr for her to be looking at his under wear. She downplayed the whole thing saying it was no big deal and that she saw that I was struggling with work and then kids and wanted to help me by doing the laundry. I told her she shouldn't have done it but my husband didn't react and she used that to support her argument saying no one thinks it's a big deal except me. We argued and she shut me down then started crying saying she meant well and was trying to help out. But I couldn't help but think this was not her place.

One of the girls on my flat has asked me to turn off the fairy lights when I leave my room for class or go back home for the weekend. She's very environmentally conscious and I generally comply with her requests like recycling the toilet paper rolls. However, it's a bit of a hassle turning on and off the fairy lights everytime I leave, especially since  I'm usually rushing for class.

To be clear, I pay hostel fees to the university which covers all my utilities and food etc. We are not renting a house and splitting the utility bill amongst 6 people in which case I would have understood her request since it affects how much she has to pay.

I m32 met my wife 3 years ago. We got married 9 months ago. We have a baby boy together that she got pregnent with while we were engaged. My wife used to be a s_x worker. No judgement on that please! She did what she had to do to survive. My parents were always being ""skeptical"" about her and lot of times asked if I wanna settle down with her. When she got prengnent, they went nuts and demanded a dna test. They refused to attend the wedding til the dna test was done which caused a huge problem.


They ended up missing the wedding obviously. The test was done BECAUSE my wife wanted to prove a point and eventually my parents made ammends and we reconciled.


They started visiting and yesterday noticed the photo of the dna test that I hang in the living room. They asked about it and I told that it serves as a reminder for why they didn't attend my wedding, they were stunned and livid when I mentioned that I tell any guest the same thing I told them. Mom and dad were mad and asked me repeatedly to take it down saying I'm being too harsh on them and refusing to let go of the past as well as embarrassing them to the other family members. I refused to take it down and I admit being sarcastic in my response saying ""it goes with the hoise decor!.""


They begged then refused to come over anymore til I remove it. My brother thinks it's petty and childish and said I should take it down.


Alright I'm editing some stuff in. First of all, my wife does not mind having the photo up , she laughs about it sometimes but she's still carrying some hurt that was caused by what happened. And second of all, no, she no longer does s_x work it's all in the past.

We were very close and he left me the cottage he bought his late wife. My ex and his brothers have spent the last 2 years trying to convince me to sell the cottage to them.

Unfortunately, due to their actions, the cottage now has more negative emotions tied to it than positives so I want to get rid of it. I won’t sell it to them, especially not to my ex because he’s hurt me badly.

I have a friend, who my ex hates, who has offered to buy it from me. I know he’s only offering because he knows it’ll hurt my ex but I’m considering selling it to him. My ex’s brothers have been trying to convince me not to do it as they’re convinced he’ll have the cottage destroyed. 

My ex confronted me about it a few days ago and told me I’m being spiteful and his grandfather would never forgive me if the cottage was destroyed. He told me he would rather I keep it over me selling it to my friend and he was willing to do whatever it took to stop me from selling it.

My cousin thinks I should just sell it to my ex and be done with it as she doesn't think my ex will take this lying down and she thinks I'll regret doing this in the long term. However, I don't want to sell it to him or anybody else in his family.

1337,yo1bk7,AITA for discouraging my sister from repeating her weird cruel baby shower game?,discouraging my sister from repeating her weird cruel baby shower game,"A few years ago when I (27F) was pregnant my SIL offered to throw my shower. She said my sister “Kate” (31F) was organizing the games. Kate doesn’t have or want kids but she loves babies and loves doing party stuff so I trusted her entirely.

Shortly into the shower, Kate gave everyone a slip of paper and a pen and broke out a tape measure. She said the game was going to be guessing how big around I was. Which seems like a weird game to begin with, but as Kate knows I’ve struggled with an eating disorder my whole life. In a year my weight can swing 50 pounds, plus I’d gained 45 during pregnancy. Yet for some bizarre reason Kate thought making my 8-months pregnant waistline the center of attention would be “fun”. I was mortified and fighting back tears for the sake of not ruining the party for everyone. I was mortified. If my bestie hadn’t understood what was happening and run right to my side, I’m sure I would have lost it. I was so hurt. I feel like even for a mother-to-be with perfect body image, this would be a disturbing “game”. I was choking back tears but skate seemed oblivious to that.

I decided not to say anything to her about it after the shower or afterwards. I was saving my energy for my son and it was over so why bother.

Yesterday Kate told me she’s organizing a shower for a family friend, so I (nicely, I thought) suggested she skip that “game”. She was dumbfounded so I explained (again, rather nicely) how I hurt I had been by it, and maybe to skip that game in the future. You never know how an expectant mother is feeling about the changes in their body. She blew up that I was wrong to “harbor this rage” at her for all these years, that I was “projecting my insecurities” onto our friend, and she even suggested I was ungrateful for her helping at my shower. Then she hung up on me.

Am I really TA here? I was just trying to spare our friend the hurt that I felt. I really feel like the whole game is a weird and uncomfortable for everyone there, eating disorder aside. Was I wrong to discourage her from doing it again?

ETA: to clarify, there was nothing medical about this “game.” That’s not even how doctors/midwives measure you. And I couldn’t have said anything beforehand, I was literally on stage in front of our entire family and all our friends when Kate dropped it on me. I’ve never even heard of this before or after, so it’s not a local custom. And not that it matters but I didn’t feel “fat,” I had fought hard for every single pound on me. I spent my whole life trying to make my rather severe malnutrition NOT be the topic of conversation.

1357,yoa7t2,AITA for not letting my daughter have locks for her room,not letting my daughter have locks for her room,"My (43f) daughter Lara (17f) has been struggling to focus on her studies with her brothers Kyle (12m) and Ryan (9m) constantly disrespecting her privacy. A few days ago, she was yelling for Kyle to come to her room. I asked her what happened. She explained that Kyle flipped all her items upside down. I called Kyle to come and flip everything right side up.

Yesterday, Ryan was running into her room and kept stealing her stuff, while she ran to get them back. On the night of the same day, Lara was trying to sleep, when the brothers suddenly barged in and ran through it, resulting in her screaming at them to stay out and close the door while she was sleeping, to give a few examples.

Today in the morning, her father (48m) told her he didn't like the way she was screaming. She said that she was trying to sleep and her brothers were making all kinds of ruckus. He told her that they are kids and they will learn. She said that they will never learn and the only way for them to learn is to have locks installed for her room. He did not want her to and they went back and forth on this until she threatened she would move out as soon as she became financially independent since she wasn't going to wait for them to mature and they should already know to respect her privacy to which he said to wait to include me in the conversation.

I overheard, and when she went to her room, I told her she wasn't going to have locks set up because she already wastes her time without the need for locks and I don't want her to fail. Lara said that they were never going to listen without them and I told her that I would make sure they wouldn't enter her room.

This evening, I heard her shouting for me. We were all in the living room. Her father explained what was going on. Lara said that she was making Kyle tea when he did he's not allowed to do. She said that she was going to tell on them and he said that if she promises to not tell, he and Ryan will never go into her room again. She didn't say anthing so they ran upstairs to her room.

I told her that she has no right to complain since she always sleeps in Kyle's room after school. Her brothers all agree and Lara calls all of us the worst, none of us are allowed in her room, and leaves. She comes back after a minute and says that she only sleeps in Kyle's room because he never uses it aside from sleeping at night, and if he was to use it for studying, then she would never go there. Meanwhile, they constantly disturb her, mess with her stuff, and made her unable to sleep just last night.

I told her if they ever go into her room, she needs to go to me. Then Kyle starts saying that they had the right to go into her room while she was trying to sleep because they were playing.

1362,yo7vk5,WIBTA for telling my Mum she can't get married within 2-3 months of my wedding?,wibta for telling my mum she cant get married within months of my wedding,"Myself and my Fiance got engaged last year and are getting married this spring. My Mum has been with her partner for 15 years. It was never clear whether they were ever going to get married due to other family dynamics. They are both divorced. 

My step-father very casually proposed to my Mum by simply mentioning to her in early 2021. They didn't start to move forward with any plans right away. 

When I got engaged later last year my fiance took me ring shopping. I was sending my mum possible pictures but we eventually went for a bespoke ring. My Mum then went engagement ring shopping the next week for hers and only told me about it on the day. She got a more generic (but likely still more expensive) ring which meant she got hers only a week later. Since mine was being made from scratch I didn't get mine until several months later. Myself and my fiance found this slightly distressing at the time because it was odd for her to get hers the exact same time I was looking for mine and then a bit of a let down for her to then get hers first. We did not say anything though. 

In the year that has passed she has not made any wedding plans of her own. I have been planning mine a lot. 

I had told her that my fiance and I had been looking at wedding rings the last couple weekends. I also sent her some potential pictures of ideas I had. When I asked her how her weekend was she said she and her Fiance had bought their wedding rings this weekend. 

We were shocked that they had deliberately bought rings right when I had told her we were looking at rings for a 2nd time. My fiance says that I need to tell my Mum that she is not allowed to get married 2-3 months either side of our wedding. He is worried that since she keeps copying me that she will do this again with the actual wedding. I agree, but I know that I can't control what they do and I otherwise have a very close relationship with my Mum. I think she has just done these things thoughtlessly rather than maliciously. 

So WIBTA if I asked her not to get married close to my wedding?

Edit: People make a fair point about maybe 2-3 months being too long. Also I probably would ask instead of tell, if I decide to say anything.

Maybe I should have included this info but to be honest I hadn't even thought about why we don't want them to get married close to us:
Due to the aforementioned family dynamics, some other family members don't want them to get married. So when they do, it will no doubt cause sulking and rifts for at least a few weeks with other family members. I really want everyone to just be getting along for my wedding.

Update: 
Thank you for your votes. I think I will simply ask her when she is thinking of getting married. I know I can't control what she does and I don't own the dates, but I don't think that should stop me asking her if she would consider avoiding around my date more as a favour. She has made other weird comments like joking about borrowing my wedding dress so there are other things that make me uncomfortable.

1378,yo0hrn,AITA for telling one of my students that he’s in no position to tell his classmate to go back to his special Ed class when he is the only one failing both math and science?,telling one of my students that he’s in no position to tell his classmate to go back to his special ed class when he is the only one failing both math and science,"I’m a 5th grade teacher with a classroom of about 35 kids. We recently had a student who transferred from a special education class that was meant for severely disabled students. To maintain his privacy, I’m going to call him Tony. Tony is extremely smart, but very socially inept. So he doesn’t have any friends in class, and he’s not exactly well liked. 

We were doing a history lecture and for whatever reason, one of the students brought up Muhammad Ali, completely irrelevant to the class. Tony stated that Muhammad Ali isn’t black. Before I had a chance to correct him, the resident class bully, named Kevin, blurted out an extremely inappropriate comment along the lines of. 

“Muhammad Ali isn’t black? Are you stupid? Go back to that ( R Slur ) class with those (r slur) kids. “

(Obviously he said the full R word out loud. I call it the R slur because my kid is autistic and that word is very offensive to both of us. )

I blurted out to Kevin that he’s in no position to say that to him when he’s the only kid in the class failing math and science.  

Needless to say the rest of the class laughed harder at him than at the incorrect statement Tony made about Ali. 

The next day, I was called to the office with the principal and the Kevin’s parents saying that my comment to him was uncalled for and demanding that I apologize. I had to explain to them as I have reported the issue several times that Kevin was bullying Tony and belittling him in front of the class and had several conversations with him about it. 

I’m beginning to have second thoughts and I don’t know if what I said what really uncalled for.

My mom and dad both are severely Anti-Social. It is in a level that they haven't left our neighborhood for 12 years since I left for medical school to another city. In my childhood I wasn't also allowed to call any friend of mine to my house or they never came to any parent-child conferences, my school stuff or even family events because it was ""Too Much People"". They would e-mail with my teachers or have phone calls(this would be in emergencies,mostly they emailed them). Luckily both of my grandparents and my uncle's and aunt's from both side cared for me immensely even though all of them had their own kids or their own life etc. In my medical school graduation all of them were there and at my graduation from residency,they organized a festival in our neighborhood (they were 400ish people,not kidding).If there weren't them,I wouldn't have had a normal childhood. My parents are also both working from home as data analysts since early 2000s so they 95% don't leave their houses.

I am also engaged to my fiance(35M) for 6 months and we are together for 9 years. To be fair,my parents tried to have a relationship with him but it was ""too much"" for them(seriously,they said that) and they said ""You are happy so we are happy too,just send us an invitation to your wedding of things go forward."" Even though all of this,I love my parents and I want them to have their place as my parents in my wedding and I just want them to be present in one of my life events so I asked them to participate in planning. They said no. I said ""Maybe a wedding speech?"" They said they wouldn't. Then I asked ""Sit in the front row at least?"" They said ""We don't like to be the attention.""  I finally exploded and said they weren't in my significant moments,they never participated in any of my life events and they even didn't try getting to know my fiance. I said ""just stay at your heaven(they call their house their heaven) and don't bother me anymore. Good night."" and I left their house.

2 days later,I sent the wedding list to our organisor and my parents weren't in the list. Our organisor is also my cousines boyfriend so when he saw the list,he called her and she texted all of my Family and ILs. My ILs and my grandparents think they got what they deserved but all f my parents siblings and their kids think I should abide to them and invite them as normal.guests. so,AITA?

1388,yohj6t,AITA for not buying my wife a burger?,not buying my wife a burger,"I was out grabbing a coffee at McDonald's at 2pm after being out for a few hours. When I got to the ordering window in the drive through, I realised I hadn't eaten anything all day so I ordered a burger too. I did this at the ordering window, after already ordering the coffee.

There was a lengthy queue in front and behind me, and my phone was in the middle console (not hooked up to bluetooth) so I couldn't call my wife to ask her if she wanted anything. But I also assumed she would have eaten lunch at home because she had left over pizza in the fridge and she normally eats lunch around 12pm. It was also a 30 minute trip home so the food would have been cold, whereas I planned to eat in the car. (I did, though it was too messy so I had to finish it at home.)

So I get home and my wife goes off at me. She said I was very selfish and that if she were in my position, she would have ordered nothing at the window, waited in line until she could drive out and park, phoned me to ask whether I wanted anything, and gone through the drive through again. I said that was total bullshit and that she would never have done that in a million years.

Even after I explained that I assumed she would have eaten, had left over pizza in the fridge, that I couldn't call her, and that I only decided at the last second to get myself a burger, she still said I was selfish. I then pointed out that she could easily make food at home, and that missing out on a shitty burger one day wasn't going to kill her. She stood firm.

TL;DR - I didn't get my wife a burger when it was almost impossible to do so, and she called me selfish.

AITA?

1390,yoj19u,AITA For not watching a movie with my brother unless he promises to not Google the ending?,not watching a movie with my brother unless he promises to not google the ending,"My brother has a habit of Googling plot points and key details about movies before he has seen them. Normally this doesn’t affect me and I just let him do his thing; however, I prefer it if he doesn’t Google the ending to something I’m showing him. It siphons the joy out of showing him a movie if he Googles the ending. I love my brother and despite our different quirks we spend a lot of time together.

Recently he mentioned he wanted to see the Harry Potter movies for the first time. I haven’t seen them in about 6 years. My wife and I were planning a watch through anyway. We invited my brother over and watched the first movie with no trouble. A few days later, while watching the second movie, my brother advised he Googled Tom Riddle because he saw a post on Facebook about it. If you haven’t seen the second HP movie, just know that Googling and reading about TR will spoil a twist. I don’t fault him for this Google search because he was prompted by a post and didn’t know any better; however, when I asked him to please avoid Googling anything else about HP until we finished the series, he told me no. He stated he can Google whatever he wants and it doesn’t affect me. The callous way he made this statement with no regard towards the impact his actions have on other people hurt me a lot. We invited him over to our home and showed him something we care about just to have him sit there and Google what comes next.

I did my best to explain how I want him to experience the story without diluting it with haphazard Google searches spoiling key points. One of the great joys in my life is finding a movie I think someone will love and showing it to them. The situation became extremely stressful for me. My wife and I aren’t sure we want to invite him back over to watch any more of the HP movies. We both think HP would be more peaceful with just us two.

I understand the only “first time” watch through experience being ruined is his, so maybe I shouldn’t care. He knows how far out of my way I will go to insure someone has a good experience with a film. I don’t think he is refusing to promise simply to antagonize me; however, he knows exactly how antagonized I will be and he has chosen to do it anyway.

I also understand this might seem like it’s just a silly sibling argument about a movie. I wouldn’t be making this post if he hadn’t stated, and I quote, “Would you be open to selecting an unbiased arbiter (someone we both know & agree on) to determine if it is indeed a reasonable expectation?” In reference to my expectation of not Googling a movie someone wants you to experience. If he wants to read what happens on Wikipedia he can do it at his own house while the movies drone on in the background. I just don’t want to be a part of it.

She met her husband three years later. He was a widower with a 7 month old son (I think he was 7 months old when they met). She instantly moved them in and started claiming his son as her own and raising him like us. She got engaged to him and a few weeks before the wedding our dad died. By this point my mom had just become estranged from her entire extended family. She told my dad's parents that if they wanted to see us again soon, they would need to come to her wedding and watch all three of us (including my stepbrother). She then told them after the wedding that going forward if they wanted to see us, or spend time with us, they had to include him. They hadn't wanted to. They tried to argue for time with just us. Offering to pay for it all 100%. But mom said no. She said they needed to come to the house and make an effort with all three and not just take two with them.

My sister and I would argue with mom over one day in particular. My dad's birthday. We celebrated that every year with dad's family after he died, but she wouldn't even let that day be just us and them. Our stepbrother had to be there. She said they did not get to be just our family and we shouldn't see him as any less deserving of being present. But we did. He was not our dad's kid, and had never met him. So why was he deserving of being there? I never got that. She called us selfish for the mindset.

Last year I turned 18 and I moved in with my girlfriend. Once I left home, my stepbrother was no longer invited to anything to do with my dad's family. He no longer saw them. My sister and I also stopped spending any time at mom's house. Then we stopped speaking to them at all. It was quiet for several months and then last week mom showed up where I work and demanded we talk. She told me how she was tired of one of her kids being left out and how sick was it to discard him that way, and why weren't my sister and I advocating for him. I told her she only had one kid, her stepson, and that my sister and I were no longer her kids and my family were no longer forced to include him to see us and that it was all her fault for forcing it in the first place. Then I wished her luck, which was kinda sarcastic not gonna lie, and then asked her to leave. She texted me later that night to say she had been a good mom to all three of us and to say she only had one kid was low.

So yesterday my mom cooked a noodle meal, that I didn't like. She knows I don't like this particular type of meal, as I always tell her, but she told me that this one was diffrent and that I would like it.

Well I ate it and when she asked I said ""better than nothing, but not amazing"", after dinner I got some for lunch the next day too (I always get left overs for lunch), and after eating, she said ""not so bad now, eh?"", I answered ""Better than nothing"", she then asked if I liked it, and I simply answered ""No.""

She said something about me being rude and walked away, then was just quiet for a while (unusual since she usually talks A LOT), but I've been feeling kinda guilty since then. She usually makes really great food, but once in a while she makes it the way she likes it, while knowing I don't like it, and I think that is fair, as long as it's not too often, which it isn't. But my logic has always been, if you don't want a truthful answer, don't ask me.

1397,yolok1,WIBTA if I reconnected with my children even though I suspect one of them doesn’t actually want to reconnect?,wibta if i reconnected with my children even though i suspect one of them doesn’t actually want to reconnect,"I’m the mother of three children, 24M, 36F and 38F. The 36-year-old still visits me and keeps in touch, but the other two cut contact with me.

Until last night, I had no idea why my eldest daughter had cut ties with me. We had a wonderful relationship, and she was always my favourite.

My daughters were wanted and loved by both of us. My son was an accident that happened under extremely inconvenient circumstances.

Why my son cut ties with me was no mystery. I treated my son terribly his entire time living with me. He had an awful childhood where he was rejected by almost everyone including his family. I verbally abused him from before he could understand words and rarely showed him any love. My husband largely ignored him unless I wasn’t around to look after him, and his sisters weren’t around for most of his childhood because they’re much older than him.

He grew up into a sullen, quiet, antisocial teenager who spent the bulk of his time in his room and didn’t speak to anyone in the family unless he was spoken to or was lashing out. He graduated a year early, left home at 17, and cut contact with me, my husband, and my daughters. I reported him missing to the police, but nothing came of it. For years, I had no idea where he went.

Five years later, he showed up at my doorstep. He looked like a mess, but he wanted me to know that he’d made it. When he left home, it was because he’d gotten a full scholarship to a university in the next state over. He’d gotten a bachelor’s degree and had been accepted into a doctorate program. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in the mood to hear him out. My divorce was happening at the time, and I snapped at him for making me wonder if he was dead for five years. The stress of wondering if we’d essentially killed him was part of what ended our marriage. I’d meant it in a loving way, but he left before I was finished.

Within months of that, my eldest daughter started tapering off communication with me. I didn’t know why until I got a phone call last night.

It was my eldest. She and her brother want to reconnect with me. A week after I’d shut the door on him, my son tracked her down and gave her a call. He was really struggling with depression and didn’t have anyone else reach out to. My eldest was just glad to hear that he was alive and invited him over. Since then, it was like she became his first real parental figure. He was visiting almost every weekend for a while and even though he doesn’t visit as often anymore, they’re still very close. And it took a lot of time and therapy, but by the sounds of it, he’s thriving now. For a while, my eldest didn’t feel like it would be right to have a relationship with me while she was “helping my victim to heal,” but after she had a child, she wanted to reconnect, so long as I can get along with her brother. We made arrangements for me to come visit them next Saturday.

I realized today that he’s probably just doing it for her.

1410,yopmla,AITA For refusing to change my workout routine to appease my husband,refusing to change my workout routine to appease my husband,"My husband (34M) and I (32F) have a 2-year-old son.  About a year ago, our son was in daycare and both my husband and I were working full time.  But we started having a lot of issues with our daycare and felt they weren't doing enough to work with us on those issues.  Eventually, we had a ""last straw"" moment and pulled him out of that center.  For about 2-3 weeks, we took turns staying home with him while we tried to find a new daycare, but everywhere was either fully booked, too far away, or not what we were looking for.  We are on a waiting list for our top 2 picks, but they don't expect openings until early next year.  

That led to a hard conversation about what we were going to do.  We ended up deciding, together, that I would remain at work and my husband would stay at home with our son.  This was because of multiple factors.  My job gives better benefits, including our insurance.  It also pays more and offers more upward mobility.  

I work in a highly competitive corporate environment and it can be very stressful.  That stress is made even worse by being the sole provider for our household.  I feel constant pressure to perform well at work.  In order to decompress after work, I use my company's gym facilities at our offices after work.  This usually takes me 30-60 minutes depending on my workout.  It's also a huge boost to my self-esteem because I'm still working towards getting my pre-birth body back. 

My husband has started to gripe at me about staying at work later to workout.  I've explained to him that I use that time to decompress so that when I get home, I'm in full mommy/wife mode.  I don't want to rush home and still be thinking about work.  But he feels it's inconsiderate of me to take time for myself nearly every day when he doesn't get that same opportunity.  

It turned into a fight this past weekend because he made a comment about it again and I told him that I am not going to change my routine.  I told him it's the easiest way for me to work out and that it doesn't add that much time to me being out of the house since I can workout at my office.  I told him that I'm constantly stressed at work and working out before I get home allows me to relieve that stress so when I get home I'm fully present.  

I also reminded him that hopefully we can get our son back into daycare in a few months and that this is all short-term.  I give him plenty of time to himself on weekends so it's not like he never has time for himself.  I told him the stress of being the sole provider is a huge burden that I feel every day and my workout routine is the biggest thing that helps me cope with that.  

He told me that I'm being selfish and that I may be a good provider, but I'm being a crap mother and wife.  I told him that is by far the meanest thing he has ever said to me and all he said was ""Sometimes the truth hurts."" He refused to apologize to me and doesn't understand why I need that time for myself.",my husband m and i f have a yearold son about a year ago our son was in daycare and both my husband and i were working full time but we started having a lot of issues with our daycare and felt they werent doing enough to work with us on those issues eventually we had a last straw moment and pulled him out of that center for about weeks we took turns staying home with him while we tried to find a new daycare but everywhere was either fully booked too far away or not what we were looking for we are on a waiting list for our top picks but they dont expect openings until early next year that led to a hard conversation about what we were going to do we ended up deciding together that i would remain at work and my husband would stay at home with our son this was because of multiple factors my job gives better benefits including our insurance it also pays more and offers more upward mobility i work in a highly competitive corporate environment and it can be very stressful that stress is made even worse by being the sole provider for our household i feel constant pressure to perform well at work in order to decompress after work i use my companys gym facilities at our offices after work this usually takes me minutes depending on my workout its also a huge boost to my selfesteem because im still working towards getting my prebirth body back my husband has started to gripe at me about staying at work later to workout ive explained to him that i use that time to decompress so that when i get home im in full mommywife mode i dont want to rush home and still be thinking about work but he feels its inconsiderate of me to take time for myself nearly every day when he doesnt get that same opportunity it turned into a fight this past weekend because he made a comment about it again and i told him that i am not going to change my routine i told him its the easiest way for me to work out and that it doesnt add that much time to me being out of the house since i can workout at my office i told him that im constantly stressed at work and working out before i get home allows me to relieve that stress so when i get home im fully present i also reminded him that hopefully we can get our son back into daycare in a few months and that this is all shortterm i give him plenty of time to himself on weekends so its not like he never has time for himself i told him the stress of being the sole provider is a huge burden that i feel every day and my workout routine is the biggest thing that helps me cope with that he told me that im being selfish and that i may be a good provider but im being a crap mother and wife i told him that is by far the meanest thing he has ever said to me and all he said was sometimes the truth hurts he refused to apologize to me and doesnt understand why i need that time for myself,563,NAH

I had another roommate before her but she left when the lease was up so I have been in the apt for a year longer then her.

They usually come over for an hour then they go out so I haven’t had to put up with them much. 

Last weekend she told me she was having the same friends over but they were gonna spend the night in and hangout and order in some food and asked me if I wanted to join.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years. I am 36 and she is 31. This year we moved into a bigger house, and she got pregnant.

After 3 months of pregnancy, I hired a maid to help with house chores. I was raised with some maids my parents hired, so I thought why not do the same?

My wife was very chatty with her since day one, and insisted in helping the maid to clean. I told her not to help her because I hired her to do a job, and she should not interfere, but she keeps doing it.

Sometimes I find both just talking drinking coffee, or doing whatever, and I tell the maid to go back to work, but my wife tried to make her stay.

They even go to another places together, like malls or cafés outside their work hours.

I told my wife that her relationship with the maid is inappropriate, since she is our worker, and not a friend.

She was mad at me, and for a few days both of them didn't talk to each other.

But then, my wife came to me, and said that she fired the maid, so now there is no work relationship and they can be friends.

I blow up at her, because she had no authority to fire her since I hired her, and she was crossing a line. I tried to call the maid to rehire her, but she declined my offer since she already found another house to clean.

I told my wife to get her shit together, and that we are not supposed to ""make friends"" with employees, she told me to that I can't control her friendships and that I created this problem.

She is giving me the silent treatment now.

He is in the window in his car seat and the row in front is empty.  A couple rows up  has four of the five seats available. This is for reference, the flight was only 70% full.   My child likes to reach out and touch his feet to the chair in front so we were relieved that we didn't have to spend the entire flight fighting his legs off the seat in front.  ( there's nothing worse than sitting in front of someone smashing your seat from behind the whole time). The doors close and a woman from the back of the plane decided to come up and take the window seat in front of my kid. 

Then starts the hour plus struggle of fighting legs off of the seat, intermixed with him being upset we were trying to pin his legs down.  We were just hoping to get him to sleep so everyone could get some rest. The woman started looking back huffing every time her seat was nudged even before take off. Right after take off she fully reclined putting the seat back into the lap of my kid and looks like she's trying to sleep. After more looks and comments about controlling my kid I asked her if she'd be willing to move over to one of the other empty seats in the row where she could fully recline and I assured her she wouldn't be bothered. I explained how the airline dictated my kid had to be in the window seat due to his car seat otherwise I'd have moved him.  She escalated and eventually called the flight attendant. 

 The flight attendant started lecturing me about getting my kid to stop touching her seat.  Warranted,  yes,  but as any parent knows, no matter what you do,  it's not enough.  Anyway finally I had enough and told the flight attendant that the woman wasn't in her assigned seat and that the situation would be resolved if she had to move back to her assigned seat.   To diffuse the situation the flight attendant made her go back to her middle seat in the back of the plane, not only pissing her off but also the other two innocent people she was shoved between. I was at my witts end by the time it was all resolved because nothing I did was working to make it an amicable resolution.  In the end as she huffed her way passed us I quipped ""have fun in the back"". 

My friend who doesn't have kids said I was an asshole by asking the flight attendant to put her back where she came from and for the comment at the end.

My cousin's wife does most of the cleaning, but ever since she started her new job, she's had less time for it because she's always grading or teaching.

I 44F have 2 to children with my husband (2) boy and (3) girl and a bonus daughter (18F) Emily. 

My stepdaughter has been living with us for 6 months this past year. She moved in because she told us her mother kicked her out since they didn’t have a good relationship and her mother said she was too problematic.

Since her moving in, I’ve been very welcoming and I’ve spent more than enough money to help Emily get on her feet, this includes work shoes, comforter sets for her bed, hair products, clothing and underwear. We told her that she could live here as long as she needed, but since her moving here she’s become a burden to both my children and I. My children and I are used to a regimen of waking up, spending time with my husband, him dropping them off to daycare and he goes off to work and when he gets home, I cook, clean and we spend the rest of our night with the kids. 

My stepdaughter has become a burden, she has become entitled and whenever she needs anything financially she will ask either myself or my husband. When I bought her work uniform, she kept the job for 3 weeks and then quit because she “didn’t like her co-workers”. She has taken most of my savings, taken the time from my children to my husband and used that time for herself and had been extremely unappreciative for what I’ve done for her. I told her she needed to figure out a living plan because she is 18 and a legal adult and that she needs to start adulting. She mentioned how she was in school (online) and I told her that wasn’t enough since there are more hours in the day and she can do more than just be lazy all day and use her computer as an excuse. 

She told me that I am jealous of her relationship with my husband and I reminded her that she’s living in our home rent-free. I told her that she should be lucky that I treat her as my own because not everyone would do such with their stepchild.

David has been dating Madeline (17) for 6 months now and whenever they go anywhere he insists that she sits in the front. I was always against this. If a parent or grandparent is in the car it's very disrespectful to make them sit in the back so a teenager can take the front seat.

We were going to the car and I got in the front seat.

After a little back and forth, they got in Madeline's car. My son drove and Madeline got to the front seat before me and refused to move so I had to sit in the back. We got into another argument on the way there and I took his car keys as punishment. 

They dropped me off at the mall and I did my returns, did some shopping, and got some food. David and Madeline were taking a lot longer than I expected so I called David and he didn't answer. 10 minutes later I got a call from Jason saying that David and Madeline were at the house and were loading David's stuff into her car. 

I got home a little over an hour later and David's room had been cleared out and his car was gone. He left a note saying that he's going to live with his dad because I don't respect him, which is complete bullshit. I got a call from my ex saying I needed to return the car keys by the end of the day or else he'd get the police involved.

My daughter goes by a nickname that's a shorter version of her full first name, like Becky instead of Rebecca. (Fake name but you get the idea.)

I don't mind that she does that, but I'm getting tired of the way she corrects me when I introduce her. I use her full name because that's the name her dad and I gave her and I don't consider the nickname her real name. But when I introduce her, she'll immediately correct me like I called her a dirty word or something. Then she acts cold and distant toward me.

It's really embarassing because whoever I'm trying to introduce her to sees her disrespecting me like that and it puts a damper on the whole mood.

It happened again today and I'd finally had enough. I told her to drop the attitude and stop disrespecting me over nothing.

She rolled her eyes, said ""Jesus Christ"" (which she knows I hate because I'm Catholic) and then walked away from us and waited in the car. I was mortified and ended up crying in the bathroom.

So, my Mil (my husband's mom) passed away 2 weeks ago. She lived hours away in her hometown and we had to drive 6 hours to get there and attend the funeral later. At first I didn't want to go and the reason is because of my BIL ""Michael"". He's my husband's halfbrother (mil isn't his mom) Michael and I had some issues in the past that I will not elaborate on. I went LC with him then full on NC. I asked my husband if Michael was going to be there and he said it was a no brainer since he and MIL had a close relationship. I didn't want to go and my husband argued about it for hours, then came home later and said that Michael would not be there due to travel issues (he lives in another state). I decided to go to with my husband but later on, I was shocked to see Michael walk up to us with his wife and daughter. I froze in my spot and looked at my husband because he lied about him not coming. I did not confront him because they embraced each other and started crying. His wife was watching as I turned around and walked away. I went to a hotel and stayed there. My husband called right after the funeral and was lashing out calling me ridiculous and unbearable for pulling this stunt and for walking out of the funeral and leaving him there alone. I said he lied to me about Michael's presence at the funeral and he wasn't alone, apparently he had his family with him. He got loud saying that I was insane to expect his half brother to miss the funeral of his stepmother and told me to get a clue. I felt so unset I started crying when he said that I was useless. I packed and went home but he further argued that I showed no empathy or support by not only walking out the funeral but also going home as well.

We argued when he came home and I explained again how he lied to me but he kept saying that it was illogical to expect Michael to not show up. He told me that I was a stuck up and need to get over myself.


AITA for leaving after i felt uncomfortable by Michael's presence?


ETA it doesn't matter what Michael did and what issues we had, I out a boundary in place and saw that it was disrespected. A lot of family were calling me harsh for the NC but that's a boundary I put and it should be respected nomatter the reason behind it. When Michael first saw me, he looked at his wife and she looked at me like she was watching my reaction. There were kids around and I tried yo stay as calm as I could.


ETA I'm gonna go ahead and elaborate on these issues but will remain as vague as possible. The issues we had involved inheritance. FIL's inheritance. Michael and his wife wanted to keep the family home to themselves (since they have kids) and only let my husband have a small piece of land that was worth a lot less. My husband didn't care but I got involved and threatened Michael with court on my husband's behalf since it seemed like they were robbing him off and he did nothing to stop it.

But I just couldn't do it. I've always been a shy, socially awkward guy and have never been good at talking in social situation. Which is weird as my profession is as a DJ. But, my absolute worst nightmare is to stand up in front of a crowd, with all eyes on me and give a speech.

I have literally had nightmares where I've had to do this. When I was in University, I had to take drugs to be able to do any types of oral presentations. It got so bad that my tutors just stopped asking me to do them. Which was absolutely fine with me.

But when my best buddy asked me to be his Best Man, all those feelings of dread came back. I said I would have to ""Take a couple of days to think about it"". Which I'm pretty sure hurt him. Then his fiance started phoning me a day or so later, telling me that she doesn't get why I'm being difficult. I just made up some stupid excuse about not being able to afford the kilt-hire (I'm Scottish). But she kept assuring me that it would all be paid for. Then I just told her the truth, that I'm absolutely petrified of talking in front of large crowds.
She told me not to be stupid and just do it. The conversation ended and I told her no. The wedding was a few weeks ago and I never even went to the ceremony. I was invited. But I just couldn't handle it. I popped in for an hour or so to the night party, but left pretty quickly. They're now married and I've not heard from either of them since.

So basically my husband and I have been a bit rocky this past year. He went out the other day and bought a turkey for Christmas Day, without even consulting me - insisting we were having Christmas dinner at home alone for the first time ever.

Now, normally we have Christmas dinner at my parents because we’re quite close and I’ve always spent Christmas with them. He has a bit of a chip on his shoulder about them. But the fact he didn’t even factor into ASKING me and just bought the turkey shocked me. 

I got angry with him and told him it was unfair to make that sort of a decision without consulting me first as I might have liked to have seen my parents on Christmas Day. 

He then got annoyed and said it’s not about what I want and that I was “being selfish”, but I’m incredibly upset as I feel the choice was completely taken out of my hands. I feel very conflicted and Cant understand why he didn’t just talk to me about it in the first place. AITA?

TL:DR: husband made a decision regarding Christmas. We’ve argued but I can’t tell if I’m over-reacting.

1509,ypt65e,AITA For Not Accomodating My Spouse's Diet?,not accomodating my spouses diet,"UPDATE as this is unfolding in real time. So we are both at home but I was talking to the installation guy and didn't see her go into the kitchen. A few min later I smell food. I honestly thought maybe the installation guy brought a lunch or the neighbors were cooking  outside. 
But no. Nina was reheating leftovers from last night! The same food that possibly caused her flatuence. Once I realized I said, ""what happened to you not eating spices?!"" She said, ""oh...yeah. forgot about that"" while chewing a piece of well seasoned tofu. 

So, I'm declaring myself not the AH. I'm not even mad about this or mad at her, but I can't take responsibility for her choices. When she is serious about this we can talk about actual solutions.  Thanks to those who left reasonable comments. 


My spouse, ""Nina"",  (we are both female) has had gastro issues for years. Until now it seemed she'd rather suffer through it than actively take steps to correct it. I've given her suggestions, sent health-related info, and made multiple doc appts. She's canceled all of them for one reason or another, except for one where she was going to get a colonoscopy. But the procedure didn't happen because the morning of, the doc called in sick and Nina did not want to use the backup doc that was scheduled. She never rescheduled. 

So the issues continue. Not daily, but often. Stomach aches after eating, bloating, gassiness, constipation...you name it. To the point where she sleeps on the couch sometimes because the gassiness at night is horrid and wakes me up at night. 

Last night the same thing happened and this morning she said she thinks she needs to do an elimination diet to figure out what the issue is. She suspects it's either garlic, onion, or some other aromatic or spice. Great. This has been suggested before but she loves food and seasonings so she hasn't stuck to it (I should mention I am a trained chef, but it's no longer my career). I agree and then she says, ""We need to change how we eat."" I told her I'm not going stop eating garlic because she has stomach problems. 

She immediately got upset and said I wasn't being supportive. Because I do most of the cooking, she thinks I need to prepare food according to what she's eliminating. She said, ""So you're just not going to cook for me anymore?"" I said I'm still going to cook but I want to eat what I want to eat and I don't want to prepare bland food. I think she needs to take the initiative and meal prep food according to her needs and leave my cooking out of it. I would help her. But I'm still going to cook food with whatever ingredients I want. She will have to have to choose not to eat it. She thinks this is messed up because she loves my cooking and will have a hard time saying no. AITA for not accommodating her dietary needs?

In case it matters, Nina works fulltime (90% remote) and is the sole breadwinner for now and I am a fulltime student (remote). Finances are not and have never been an issue in our relationship, but because my schedule is more flexible, I handle a lot of household management stuff (appts, bill paying, cooking, etc).

There’s a employee Amber 30 who knows the store in and out. Does our displays and can do anything in the store.  She’s also autistic and doesn’t say much when checking people out and doesn’t really look people in the eye. 
We had a woman come in and try to make small talk with Amber. Somehow this women I’m thinking anywhere from 30-45 years got offended because she felt disrespected by Amber not making small talk with her. 

I get over there and she launches a complaint about Amber who is the nicest person in the store. I loudly say to her “I hope you feel good about bullying autistic people today? Why because they wouldn’t meet some imaginary standards you have” the women tries to defend her situation about how Amber shouldn’t be cashier if she can make polite conversation. I noticed a teenager filming the woman and I tell her I’m sorry that you feel like people with disabilities don’t deserve jobs because you feel like everyone should carry on a conversation with you. The woman noticed the teen filming her and asked her to stop and the customer got called a main character.  She repeatedly asked the teen to stop filming and tried to explain her position again and just started cry saying she was actually the one having a bad day and said she was sorry the customer left crying. Another older lady (80’s) said it it was ridiculous that you can’t even make a basic complaint anymore without someone recording you. Amber went home early from her shift after being up about the crying customer.

1522,ypxy6e,AITA For asking my husband for more money for daily expenses,asking my husband for more money for daily expenses,"I (30F) am a SAHM with 2 kids, 4 & 2.  My husband (32M) works full-time for a large corporation.  His job used to require him to travel quite a bit, but when we had our second child, I told him he needs to try and switch roles so that he can be home more with us.  He didn't want to do this because he felt he was on a career path with a higher ceiling and didn't want to set himself back.  But, he eventually came to see things from my point of view and took a different role that didn't require travel and even allows him to WFH occasionally.

He set up his paycheck so that it is divided between 3 separate accounts.  One for savings, one for monthly bills, and one for spending.  I have access to all 3 accounts.  We pretty much never touch the savings and monthly bills accounts, except to adjust for any changes to our monthly expenses.  I use the spending account for groceries, things for the kids, and activities and outings for me to do with the kids.

With the cost of everything going up, I've started to notice that our spending account gets much lower between pay periods and I have to be careful for overdrafts now.  I'm not changing our spending habits, I'm buying pretty much the same groceries and household items every month, things are just costing more.  It's not like I'm splurging on anything for myself either.  

We live in the Midwest and now that winter is coming and I can't take the kids outside easily, I know we are going to have to find fun outings that we can do inside, but those tend to cost money.  So, I asked my husband if we can adjust the amount of money that goes into our spending account each month so that I can start to plan things like zoo, aquarium, or museum visits with the kids.  I'm not going to spend all winter cooped up inside with 2 energetic toddlers.  I'm going to need to get them out of the house to do things, and things cost money.

But my husband flat out refused.  He said our monthly bills are going to increase during the winter months because we have to pay more for heat and that it doesn't look like the prices of household items is going to go down anytime soon.  He said I'm just going to have to do more with less and try to make do until he gets his annual review and hopefully a raise.  

I told him he's being unfair to me and the kids to deprive them of fun activities.  I told him he doesn't know what it's like to be stuck inside with energetic kids all day and I need to get them out of the house.  He told me to find ways to do that for cheap or free and that our spending account is not going to change.  

He told me that if I want more spending money, I should get a part-time job in the evenings.  But by the time he gets home from work, I'm already exhausted and I don't have energy for a job.  He told me that I pressured him into taking a less lucrative career path, and now we are seeing the consequences of that decision.  He told me that it's his job to make money and it's my job to make our money go further.",i f am a sahm with kids my husband m works fulltime for a large corporation his job used to require him to travel quite a bit but when we had our second child i told him he needs to try and switch roles so that he can be home more with us he didnt want to do this because he felt he was on a career path with a higher ceiling and didnt want to set himself back but he eventually came to see things from my point of view and took a different role that didnt require travel and even allows him to wfh occasionally he set up his paycheck so that it is divided between separate accounts one for savings one for monthly bills and one for spending i have access to all accounts we pretty much never touch the savings and monthly bills accounts except to adjust for any changes to our monthly expenses i use the spending account for groceries things for the kids and activities and outings for me to do with the kids with the cost of everything going up ive started to notice that our spending account gets much lower between pay periods and i have to be careful for overdrafts now im not changing our spending habits im buying pretty much the same groceries and household items every month things are just costing more its not like im splurging on anything for myself either we live in the midwest and now that winter is coming and i cant take the kids outside easily i know we are going to have to find fun outings that we can do inside but those tend to cost money so i asked my husband if we can adjust the amount of money that goes into our spending account each month so that i can start to plan things like zoo aquarium or museum visits with the kids im not going to spend all winter cooped up inside with energetic toddlers im going to need to get them out of the house to do things and things cost money but my husband flat out refused he said our monthly bills are going to increase during the winter months because we have to pay more for heat and that it doesnt look like the prices of household items is going to go down anytime soon he said im just going to have to do more with less and try to make do until he gets his annual review and hopefully a raise i told him hes being unfair to me and the kids to deprive them of fun activities i told him he doesnt know what its like to be stuck inside with energetic kids all day and i need to get them out of the house he told me to find ways to do that for cheap or free and that our spending account is not going to change he told me that if i want more spending money i should get a parttime job in the evenings but by the time he gets home from work im already exhausted and i dont have energy for a job he told me that i pressured him into taking a less lucrative career path and now we are seeing the consequences of that decision he told me that its his job to make money and its my job to make our money go further,576,NAH

Since we dont believe in tipping for takeout three days before the party we phoned in 4 separate orders just under $200 each under separate names. This gave them more than 72 hours to prepare

Yesterday me and my son went in to pickup the food. after paying and receiving the 2nd order the worker called over the manager and they figured out what was going on.  The manager said we would have to pay an additional $160 tip before he would ring me up for the 2 remaining orders. We argued back and forth for a bit and I even offered to call my 2 friends whos real name I used to place the orders to bring their ID as this was 4 separate orders under 4 different people. He dismissed the offer and said the money was necessary to pay the workers who made the food and went on about how hard the restaurant industry is.

At this point a small line had started to form behind us with customers and the workers hearing the conversation. I replied with the idea that instead of a tip he should give the workers a cut of the profits of this giant order they worked so hard for. Everyone looked at him and I could tell he started to lose his cool a bit while reaffirming no tip = no food.

At this point we said just give the rest of the order to the employees to take home as a tip because we would be leaving with the 2/4 orders we paid for. The manager said it wont happen as they have a policy where uncollected phone orders must be thrown out?? The only way they would get paid is if we tipped.

Nonetheless we left and ordered pizza to make up for the rest. Im not sure if they actually followed through with throwing out the food, however when packing the food into the car we saw the manager on the phone visibly distraught.

1529,yq1rhz,AITA for telling my sister's new boss about her historic drug use?,telling my sisters new boss about her historic drug use,"My(29f) sister(26f) has just landed a job that she is seriously underqualified and unprepared for.

It is a senior position in a industry that means she would be in direct contact with highly vulnerable people.

The recruitment process has taken  months and it has literally been the only thing she and our mum have talked about.

She doesn't have a degree and is honestly not that suitable for this type of role.

From the age of 16 to around 22 she had a serious drug habit where she overdosed multiple times. My mum even paid for her to go to rehab (even though she refused to help me pay for my wedding).

She has relapsed many times and it is highly likely that she will again. She has also stolen from me and my husband in the past to fund her habit.

My concern is that someone of her character should not be in a position of power over people and particularly those in vulnerable situations.

On Monday I sent an email to the company to just let them know what kind of person they are dealing with. I think it's important for them to know the full story before she starts her job so they can make an informed decision.

An hour ago, she called me and screamed down the phone saying that I was trying to destroy her life. She said I just didn't like the thought of her earning more than me even though I have a degree.

I explained my reasons and that I only told them so that they could decide if she was a good fit for the company.

She didn't even lose the job over it.

I was plagued with insecurities about my relationship with Lia (now 30F). I thought I was making a huge mistake so I asked my friends (Max Amy and Jack) to help me run away from the wedding before it started. They of course agreed. I didn’t go through with it at the last minute because I couldn’t stand the thought of Lia waiting at the altar for me. She didn’t deserve it. The ceremony was delayed but it went through. I made my friends promise to never tell anyone about this.

I’ve been married to Lia for 3 years and I’ve never been more happy or fulfilled. My fears were totally unfounded. We had a cancer scare a year ago and the only thing on my mind was “I can’t lose her.” My wife threw me a birthday party and of course all my friends came. We were all drunk. Amy forgot to bring her gift. Jake made a dumb joke about sneaking through the window. Amy laughed and said I had more experience with that. Lia asked what she was talking about and Amy told her about how I was about to leave her at the altar. My other friends nodded. Lia just giggled and said “lucky for me, he didn’t go through with it.”

Lia acted completely normal but sat me down one day and said “I love you. You’re sweet and considerate and handsome…I think you know what I’m about to say. I think we should-“ I interrupted her and said a baby. Lia shook her head and said she thinks we should get a divorce. That she always thought I didn’t love her as much as she fid me.

Amy came later that week with Jake to drop off her gift. It was a glass sculpture. Amy’s into glassblowing. I threw it on the ground and told her to get out. It shattered all over the floor. Jake was more furious than Amy. He and Amy began to yell at me. I told them it was supposed to be a secret and they ruined my marriage.

As some of you suggested, Gpa used pieces of the original dress to make accessories for my sister to wear, and she loved them. She'll still wear some of the hair ties for special occasions. My aunt was able to make an almost perfect replica of the dress for the wedding, so while it wasn't the same, it was close.

My sister: she did have to go to the hospital to treat her crohns flare up. It was terrifying, and since she was immuno-compromised she did catch C19. I was so scared I was going to lose my baby sister, but thankfully she pulled through. She is now finally married to her wonderful wife. My ex and I tried to have C pay for the hospital bills, but my sister refused to take the money. They do have good insurance, luckily. SIL was still pissed and torn about having C at the wedding, but my sister insisted. C wasn't part of the wedding party, but she was still invited and joined their special day. While it's not forgotten or really forgiven, my sister is willing to move on, at least.

Finally, C. I think seeing her aunt so sick did help kickstart C realizing how wrong she'd been, since it was a domino effect of her actions in the first place that started all of this. She herself admitted in therapy it was her jealousy over having to buy a wedding dress in the future instead of having one made for her like it was done for my sister. She does still struggle with her anger at times, but it is getting better. It turns out she used to get all her anger and aggression in sports at school with her friends, which is why she seemed so calm all other times, but being in lockdown just forced everything to build up in an unhealthy way. Still not an excuse for what happened, but at least an explanation.

As I said in an update last time, my ex and I are paying for college for whatever scholarships C doesn't get, so at the time taking the 12k for the dress seemed right. I do still stand by that. But after seeing how much she's worked on herself and on trying to repair things with my sister, I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills. She's also been working with my aunt and Gpa one day a week as well as editing other's essays to build back up her fun money. I matched 50%, and gave it to her when she graduated. She started college in the fall with a few scholarships, and is continuing therapy. Things are still tedious with her and my sister, but they're working on it. C has been trying hard, shown she really is sorry, and is trying to fix things. I still think we have a while to go, but we'll get there.",hey everyone its been a long time and a lot of things have happened i think its finally gotten to the point where i can post an update that many of you asked for ill do shortest update to longest update the dress many of you reached out and offered to try and help and im so thankful to you i couldnt respond to everyone but thank you so much as some of you suggested gpa used pieces of the original dress to make accessories for my sister to wear and she loved them shell still wear some of the hair ties for special occasions my aunt was able to make an almost perfect replica of the dress for the wedding so while it wasnt the same it was close my sister she did have to go to the hospital to treat her crohns flare up it was terrifying and since she was immunocompromised she did catch c i was so scared i was going to lose my baby sister but thankfully she pulled through she is now finally married to her wonderful wife my ex and i tried to have c pay for the hospital bills but my sister refused to take the money they do have good insurance luckily sil was still pissed and torn about having c at the wedding but my sister insisted c wasnt part of the wedding party but she was still invited and joined their special day while its not forgotten or really forgiven my sister is willing to move on at least finally c i think seeing her aunt so sick did help kickstart c realizing how wrong shed been since it was a domino effect of her actions in the first place that started all of this she herself admitted in therapy it was her jealousy over having to buy a wedding dress in the future instead of having one made for her like it was done for my sister she does still struggle with her anger at times but it is getting better it turns out she used to get all her anger and aggression in sports at school with her friends which is why she seemed so calm all other times but being in lockdown just forced everything to build up in an unhealthy way still not an excuse for what happened but at least an explanation as i said in an update last time my ex and i are paying for college for whatever scholarships c doesnt get so at the time taking the k for the dress seemed right i do still stand by that but after seeing how much shes worked on herself and on trying to repair things with my sister i have given her back the k that my sister didnt take for hospital bills shes also been working with my aunt and gpa one day a week as well as editing others essays to build back up her fun money i matched and gave it to her when she graduated she started college in the fall with a few scholarships and is continuing therapy things are still tedious with her and my sister but theyre working on it c has been trying hard shown she really is sorry and is trying to fix things i still think we have a while to go but well get there,564,YTA

1560,yqc7w7,AITA for taking all of my neighbor’s plants?,taking all of my neighbor’s plants,"I live next to a couple whom I’m friendly with but not much past “how are you” and chat about things in the neighborhood. Last week I was out for a morning walk and noticed Amber lugging a butt ton of plants from her backyard to her porch. She said hello so I stopped by to chat and see if she needed help. Looked like she was starting her own landscaping company!

Turns out she finally felt inspired to work on the new garden she’s been planning for months. She ripped out everything she currently had and was going to put it on the curb as freebies. I’ve always wanted to turn my lawn into a nice garden so I felt like I struck gold! I offered to pay her because there was a substantial amount of shrubbery but she refused. I wheelbarrowed everything over to my backyard, brought her some pastries as a thank you, offered cash again or to help with her new garden, she refused, and that was that. I spent the weekend with my boyfriend replanting everything and our backyard looks great!

…Until I get a knock on my door yesterday from her husband. Turns out (he said she gave permission for him to tell me this) she struggles with bipolar and was going through a manic episode. There is no “new garden” that she’s been plotting for months, just a bipolar-induced attack on their backyard that she now regrets. She’s too embarrassed to talk to me herself - I get it, I struggle with depression up the asshole and the fewer people I have the explain myself to, the better - but she wants her plants back. Apparently that garden was her baby and in a fit of mania, she destroyed it. 

I’m sad for her because shitty decisions when you’re in the mental toilet suck but like… everything is already planted in my backyard and I’m not willing to put in the effort to dig everything up. It’ll look awful, and yeah that’s what they’re dealing with now but it’s not my fault. I nicely told him pretty much that and he just said okay and left. 

Now when I see them they completely ignore me. I’ve crossed paths with them three times since and her husband waved but she didn’t even look at me. I saw them taking soil and compost bags out of their car today and Amber just looked really upset and not at all excited to be working on a new garden. My boyfriend thinks I should offer to give at least some of them back because I’m not exaggerating, she gave me a TON of plants. I just don’t want her to think she can be rude to me after her mistake then get what she wants. AITA?

Edit: read through the business y’all sent me and I’ve decided I’m going to give her a $100 gift card to our local nursery and see if she wants help planting.

1571,yqiduw,AITA for asking (not insisting) that my BF switch meals with me when I don’t like what I’ve ordered at a restaurant ?,asking not insisting that my bf switch meals with me when i don’t like what i’ve ordered at a restaurant,"Using a throwaway account since I’m a founder and moderator on my city’s subreddit and my BF could easily see this.

I have been friends with my BF for years, actually together for about 3 months now. He’s the sweetest guy and I know he’s been seriously hurt in the past and I’m so happy we are finally clicking after being “flirt buddies” since MS (we are 25 now). 

whenever we go out to eat he always orders the most basic thing—99% of the time it’s cheeseburger plain, ketchup on the side with honey mustard to dip his fries. He actually loves exotic food but he says that menus and making choices stresses him out so he doesn’t want to but thought into it. I love trying exotic things and to me that’s the reason to go out to eat. To me it’s so exciting. 

My issue is things always look and sound better than they turn out and I decide that I actually just wanted a burger. So usually I’ll ask him if he’ll switch with me and he always does and he never complains. Most of the time he even says how good his food was. To me it’s a win for both of us, it gets him out of his comfort zone and we don’t waste food.

Last night we both had to work really late so we met up at a sports bar. They were having a calamari special which sounded really good, he ordered a cheeseburger as usual. 

I just wasn’t feeling the calamari when it came out so I asked if he’d switch with me. He said no. I asked him why not and said I didn’t want it to go to waste. He said then you shouldn’t have ducking ordered it. I was like excuse me. He the went into a tirade and said I treat him like a garbage disposal, he’s a grown man, I’m being immature, don’t pin my crap on him, etc… I said it sounded like that was a rehearsed speech. He said maybe it was since I “insist” on stealing his food every time we go somewhere. I started crying and he (edited) said don’t start that bullshit with me, here have both meals and he got up and walked out.

He has not called or texted me and it’s 6am and I honestly thought he would call to apologize by now. I called my sister and near quote “you’re an asshole for waking me up at 5:30 and he’s going to see you as asking as insisting…that’s really crappy of you to put that pressure on him.” And she basically hung up.


since she said it…AITA ?

My son (33M) got “Erica” pregnant, who we knew as a daughter of a friend and she decided she didn’t want the baby, my son didn’t want the baby either…we offered to financially help Erica out, if we were able to adopt the baby as we’d always wanted another child but it never happened for us.

We paid her rent for 2 years whilst she went to college.

Cut to 11 years later.


We unfortunately have a poor relationship with our son, as he doesn’t want to be involved with our daughter but we see him and text him frequently enough, he visited us and told us Erica had asked to see our daughter - my husband had told her when she was pregnant that we MAY allow contact, but honestly we don’t think that’s best for our daughter at this stage

It’ll be confusing and upsetting, I told her when our daughter is emotionally well enough we’ll tell her, but right now she’s going through therapy for anxiety.

My son thinks I’m TA, Erica has a 2 year old now and said she “couldn’t even imagine” how our daughter will feel when she does find out that Erica has a family, my son and Erica both believe I’m TA, but not only that Ericas parents that I’ve known for over 25 years are now refusing contact and insulting us to common friends saying they “allowed” the adoption, but Erica has a right to know her daughter.

Nobody had a problem 3 years ago when we went through this, Erica contacted us then and we shot her down telling her that  we weren’t comfortable until our daughter was an adult, but now suddenly everyone is losing their mind.

1577,yqfxkm,AITA for getting tattoos when my bf hates them?,getting tattoos when my bf hates them,"Ever since the beginning of our relationship, I was aware of his feelings towards tattoos. I wanted to get a small one, and it was a whole thing. Ultimately, he accepted it because, at the time, I wanted it to only be one. But I started noticing I wanted to have another. And I genuinely believed, again, that I wouldn't want to have more. So he begrudgingly accepted it once again. 

Maybe I was naive to think that. Because now I have a whole list of ideas. And I've been wanting to get another small one. So I told him about it, and it didn't go over so well. He said I knew his stance on tattoos from the beginning, and asked me how I could expect him to be okay with it now. I honestly thought that it wouldn't matter as much, especially since we've been together for a couple of years now. 

I feel really hurt. I see a future where, every time I want to get another tattoo, I'll have to be afraid that he will not think I'm beautiful anymore. He thinks that I'll ruin my body with tattoos and that he won't like the way I look anymore. I get that he's not attracted to women with tattoos. But it's not like it's my style to cover everything. I'm more drawn to smaller tattoos. But perhaps that's naive of me to think that won't change either. 

In my opinion, this shouldn't be such a big issue. But it is, and maybe it's unfair of me to expect him to be ok with something he didn't like from the start. 

So AITA?

UPDATE: First of all, thank you for your replies! I noticed a trend of comments saying that my bf and I are incompatible and should break up. I get where you're coming from, but I don't agree. We had another conversation in the meantime, and we were able to be much more open to each other about what we feel and what we want from each other. We realized we were both being quite stubborn in our prior convo. So this time around it went much better. 

I asked him what he needs from me to meet him in the middle. And he said he would like me to show him different versions or options of the tattoo that I like, so he can decide with me. Alongside that, he likes to be able to talk about placement as well. So we talked about the specific tattoo I want right now, and he feels much better now that he has been involved. I also feel so much better, because I feel like we're more on the same page now. 

I know this might not be the solution everyone agrees with, but it feels like it's a good solution for us and our relationship. So again, thank you all so much for your insights!

1601,yqsgtc,AITA for not donating to a friend’s GoFundMe for their premature baby’s NICU stay?,not donating to a friend’s gofundme for their premature baby’s nicu stay,"I am still very good friends with an old high school classmate and his entire family. His sister and her husband just had a baby at 30 weeks via emergency C-Section due to severe preeclampsia. Now the baby has a lengthy NICU stay ahead. They started a GoFundMe to help pay for the hospital bills. This was a planned pregnancy (the sister posts excessively on social media about absolutely everything in their personal lives).

The family has asked if I would donate, and instead of lying and saying that I don’t have the means to donate, I said I wasn’t comfortable with donating, so now they’re curious as to why. 

First, they have health insurance through their employer. A lengthy NICU stay is undoubtedly more expensive than the out of pocket maximum on their health insurance. So they aren’t asking for help to pay for the baby’s entire NICU stay. They’re asking for help to pay their out of pocket maximum. This is a known amount when you sign up for health insurance, and I feel any wise person takes this into account when selecting a health plan. In my experience, when you are selecting your health insurance for the year, you have a choice between a low cost plan with a high deductible / high out of pocket maximum, or a high cost plan with a low deductible / low out of pocket maximum. So they either made a poor decision by selecting a plan with an out of pocket maximum they can’t afford, or maybe their employer just doesn’t offer very good health insurance, and they didn’t have an option for a low out of pocket maximum.

Either way, when they were signing up for health insurance and saw that the out of pocket maximum was more than they can afford, why not sign up for hospital indemnity insurance? It is extremely low cost. So even without knowing their specifics, I feel confident that their poor decision making / planning contributed to them being in this financial hole.

The second element as to why I am hesitant to donate is because I feel like they are asking for a handout instead of making a reasonable effort to address the problem themselves. I can’t imagine the out of pocket maximum for their insurance is any more than $20,000. Anything higher is unheard of. They have been homeowners for 4 years, and regardless of how much money they put down, they have a good chunk of equity based on how much property values have gone up in this area. At the current WSJ Prime Rate (7%), a $20,000 HELOC would cost $117/month for 10 years (interest only payments) and $232/month for years 10-20. I see their lifestyle on instagram daily. They can absolutely afford this, and could probably pay the HELOC off in 5 years or less. But instead of taking responsibility for their poor decision making / planning and paying it off themselves, they’re asking for a handout.

Am I the asshole for not donating?

I raised my children on my own and my oldest daughter who is out of the house has been very entitled since moving out. 

My daughter moved out around mid April of this year, I am not sure why but she grabbed all of her things after we had a disagreement which wasn’t unusual for us, and she left. I didn’t say anything harsh or do anything harsh and I am under the impression she may have been chasing after a boy which isn’t out of the norm for her. 

I’ve been estranged from my daughter since April and each time I’ve tried to contact her, none of my messages go through and when I try to reach out through social media, I can’t find her moniker. I tried calling her number today and it told me the phone was no longer in service which means she either didn’t pay her bill or the number is changed. 


Last month, my 18 year old reached out to my younger daughter to ask if she could stay for a few days (she sent this message at 2am) so I’m not sure what was going on but my younger daughter stays up late on weekends and I told my younger daughter to let her know it was fine. She decided she never wanted to come “after thinking” which was a bummer since I cleared up her room for her while waiting for her arrival.

I invited a few of my friends 23-27f. 

My friend (we can call her Amy) said that I should raise my standards and asked what my current ones are. I basically said 1) doesn’t cheat 2) tells the truth. everyone started laughing because yeah not likely to find. 

Amy 26f didnt laugh and said something along what you accept is what you allow. So, I asked what hers are. 

She told me its not about her but I insisted she tell me because I was curious. Amy has always been known to be a little uppity and intimidating to guys since shes tall and curvy but all of her breakups have been good and shes the only one who’s never been in a toxic relationship. 

She told me she always leaves on the first mess up, and if she sees a red flag she stops speaking to them. “I protect myself like I would protect a child because I have my own inner child to protect. I may lose out on one or two okay guys, but I want more than okay.” 

She said she doesnt forgive cheating, only dates if they are in the same range as her financially and are pro-choice and her height or taller, and ghosts if she finds out they do one nighters and dont take sex seriously. 

I did lose my temper some. Because when she was talking it felt like she was saying my dating history is my own fault. And I told her she was going to die alone because every guy thats proposed to her she said no to since shes still traveling a lot. 

Amy didnt get mad at me but 3 of our other friends said I was a bitch and arent talking to me/responsing to texts.

1617,yr0y2p,AITA for refusing to borrow my wedding (made by my mum) dress to my sister?,refusing to borrow my wedding made by my mum dress to my sister," EDIT: someone told me that should be ""lend"" not borrow, Sorry for my mistake.

I (32F) got married 7 years ago. 

My mom made my wedding dress and she also did the same for my older sister at her wedding 9 years ago. 

Sadly, my mother passed away 3 years ago from cancer. 

My younger sister Jess (27F) is currently engaged and her wedding will be in 1 year. 

We recently met for coffee and she commented that she always wanted our mother to make her dress, but at the time she wasn't even with her current fiancé and now she can't anymore. 

After a little chat, she asked if I still had my wedding dress, as shevwould like to wear it too, as it is something my mother made.

 I was a little disconcerted and asked if it could be our sister's dress (she already borrow it to someone else), as I was very attached to the wedding dress. She said she didn't want hers, because it wasn't white (pastel pink) and my body and hers were more similar. 

I said I didn't want to, because even though we have similar bodies, it would need adjustment in the breasts and hips area. I don't want to ""modify"" the dress. But that I could borrow her the veil so she can have something from our mother. 


She started complaining, saying that it wouldn't hurt me to borrow the dress, the adjustments would be minimal, she was the only one of the sisters who can't have something done by our mom and she basically has to turn to me to get something of hers. She practically begged me to borrow the dress. 

I feel bad for her, but I really don''t want to modify something in the dress, because it's a memory of my mom and one of the best days of my life, it was just for me. In the face of all this, I don't feel comfortable borrowing the dress, but that I could make the concession of the veil. 

She walked away crying after I stood by my decision, saying that I was being selfish not to allow her to have any feeling close to having something done for our mother and not being able to share something so special with her too, when she never will have something close to that.

 People are calling me an AH (our father, fiancé and in-laws - except my older sister who didn't chose ""sides"")

AITA?

Extra: It's not a dress I wear all the time ofc, but it's literally something that is unique to each daughter. The 3 of us have flower names, on my dress and my older sister's had details of our flowers.

1621,yr1nri,AITA for telling my daughter I couldn’t have known my parenting style would cause mental issues and say its partly her personality?,telling my daughter i couldn’t have known my parenting style would cause mental issues and say its partly her personality,"Me (62) and my oldest daughter (f28) always have had a rough relationship. I had ptsd after fleeing my home country and looking back I might’ve also have had postpartum depression after she was born.

I admit I’ve been very hard and strict with her, more than I did with her younger sister/my youngest daughter (24). I raised my daughter with outdated non-western principles, I see that now. But back then it seemed right because I was raised the same way.

My daughter has been struggling with depression and in my attempt to understand why we got into an argument. I’ve tried to talk about it a few times but she never wanted to. Today she was upset about her grades. She’s a masters student. She passed all her exams but she gets very upset and frustrated when she doesn’t get the highest score. I was trying to calm her down and cheer her on. At one point asked her: why are you like this?

She got furious and told me that me and her dad were the reason why. That her whole life she had to earn our approval. She brought up the time where she scored “middle education” instead of “higher education”, (our country has a three school system depending on your degrees) Me and my husband were angry and disappointed, we did not talk to her for 2 weeks and she could noteat with us at the dinner table. She ate in the kitchen standing up or would put her plate in front of her door and knock. I’m very embarrassed looking back at it and when she brought it up I got tears thinking that I did that to my child.

I told her that looking back we see that negative reinforcement wasn’t the right way.  I told her that we fled our home and started over elsewhere for her future so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees, a good job and a good salary so they have a better life than we had. It was frustrating to us to see that she could do better than average or middle and we handled it wrongly.

I then said: “but we could’ve never known it would have such effects on your mental health when you got older, your sister was raised the same way and isn’t so insecure so you it’s also a little bit -you as a person-“.

The conversation then escalated. She asked me where I got the nerve to blame her personality while her whole life we made her feel like she had to earn our love and approval. She said this affected her life in every aspect and it’s why she’s has a depression. She called me an asshole and said that I was basically saying she has a weak personality.

I know we made horrible mistakes and I’m ashamed of some of the things I’ve done. But I feel that it’s true. Her sister was pushed the same way and isn’t so insecure to the point it effects her mental health. She isn’t insecure at all.

My husband said there was no reason to bring that up. I believe it’s not completely our parenting style that caused her depression.

AITA for saying that to her?

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I understand the confusion about how strict we were with her little sister. I admit that her sister was given more freedom when it comes to social life. She was allowed to hang out with her friends outside of school more than her older sister. When it comes to school and grades we were as strict, but my youngest did better in highschool than her older sister. Thats also why my youngest was allowed to go out more and we would not let the oldest go out either as punishment or because we felt she needed to study more.

This has happened basically the same most times I ask. 

So we were chatting and he was waiting for a friend to turn up and drop stuff off and I was sleepy, he usually chats for a long time to her so I went for a nap after asking him to wake me up in 1 to 2 hours, he agreed. This was at about 9ish

I woke up at 3:30am. He seemed to be trying not to wake me up while going to bed.

He hadnt woke me up but he also hadnt taken out the rubbish so the cat had dug through it in the hallway and in the sitting room the 2 carrier bags of rubbish out of the little bin were sat there still.

He said he had washed towels and they would be dry soon about 2 days ago, turns out he just fully dried one and the rest are in a shopping bag next to the tumble dryer. 

So now I'd slept too much and was awake at 3:30am, on my own. I couldnt shower and get dressed, didnt want to get dressed while messy and waist clean clothes. And there is rubbish everywhere. 

So after I went to the bathroom I went back to the bedroom and asked him why he cant even follow basic instructions.

He said he tried and he even spoke to me briefly and I had said ""Whatever"" and rolled over, I dont remember this. 

But he says something similar most times this happens, I never remember and he does successfully wake me up if we are going somewhere or I have an appointment. 

So I asked why he did this and asked if he was trying to avoid me or upset me, he looked pretty upset or panicky but went to the toilet then streight to sleep. And  now I'm on my own.

I specifically did this so I wouldn't be on my own too much because me MH is bad. 

EDIT TO ADD: I wanted him to wake me after she had left, about 1 or 2 hours probably but i didnt want to wake up before he was back from seeing her or before he left, so I didnt set an alarm.

My husband (37) suffers from a medical condition which got more and more severe the past 4 months. He is now following a diet and has a strict eating schedule as part of his health management.


The kids and I eat regular food that I cook everyday. The problem is that whenever we sit to eat, my husband would try to join us. I don't mean join us in eating though he tried it once but swore he wouldn't touch any of the food again. But it was hard to take his word for it. Now he's asking to be allowed to sit with me and the kids while we eat just so he doesn't miss out on this bonding time together as a family. I refused because he might try to get his hands on the food, and also it would be awkeard for him to sit by and watch us eat. He argued that he wants to feel included at the table, and be able to chat with the kids and bond with them. I told him he can do that literally anytime anywhere just not the dining table. The kids and I should be able to eat quietly and peacefully without having to get busy talking. He got mad saying I don't get it and that by not allowing him to join us I'm trying to control what places he can be at and how he bonds with the kids. I refused to discuss it but he threw a hissy fit calling me unreasonable and claiming that I was isolating him because of his condition.


AITA for putting my foot down on this? - the kids are 10yo and 13yo.

Few points:

* His eating time conflicts with the kids eating time.

* He tends to violate his diet whenever he's around food that he shouldn't have or that isn't part of the diet. I of course would have to deal with the results.

* all I'm trying to do is make sure both he and the kids are well fed and like I said there's plenty of time for him to bond and have conversations about their day.

We checked in together and had different boarding groups - he was group 1, since he is active duty military, I was group 3, for being a platinum card holder on the airline. This is significant since both groups are considered priority boarding.

We are both under the impression that boarding groups do not necessarily matter - we are seasoned travelers, very efficient when boarding planes, and the only thing that does matter is that we are on the plane before the main groups, which are the people who do not travel often and are generally slower when boarding planes.

When the plane started boarding they obviously called group one first, the group for active duty military and unaccompanied minors - and my boyfriend gets up and boards without me. I was annoyed, since groups 1 and 2 are both super small, and group 3, my group, usually gets called super fast, if not combined with group two.

After my group gets called (literally less than 5 minutes later) and I get on the plane, I told him he could have waited for my group to get called and we could have boarded together. He told me that it wasn't a big deal, and I said it was since we were traveling together, he had never done that before, why would he do it randomly now, and he didn't have a reason besides ""it's for me, why wouldn't I use that group"" even though my group is still considered priority boarding?

We got into a mild argument about it on the plane, nothing huge since we were, well, on a plane. He thinks I'm being an asshole for starting an argument and being upset about him boarding before me but I think it's justified since he had never done it before and he didn't say anything prior.

This isn't a new thing, where he just joined the military, he's been AD for 8 years. We have travelled together multiple times. I think I have seen him use his military ID for a discount ONE time in the entire time I have known him.

**EDIT 2: i accept that i was being a huge asshole, and that i should have picked my battles and not started an argument over something so petty and small. i will be giving him a big apology this morning**

Anyway, AITA for being annoyed at him and starting an argument for boarding before me?

1657,yrh2hq,AITA for calling her unbearable?,calling her unbearable,"My wife has sensory issues. She's never been to a doctor for these issues so it's truly self diagnosed. She thinks that since she hates loud noises and doesn't like being looked at that she has sensory issues. Not trying to discredit her or anything but it's over the top some days. Like if two people are talking at once she gets super overwhelmed and irritated. Or as mentioned above, if anyone or any **thing** is looking at her, she gets self conscious and pissed off. 

On to the real issue. I got a dog about a year ago. Her name is Lola and she is a Corgi. She's very energetic and needy but training is going well. My wife has a cat, whom we have had for like 4 years I believe. She has always had a problem with my dog. Reason being is the fact that my dog is needy. She loves being touched. She wants to follow us everywhere. She whines when she wants attention She will sleep on any article of clothing we have on the floor that has our scent before sleeping on her dog bed/kennel. She is constantly sniffing the air/floor whenever we are eating and often sniffs the trash can or litter box. But my wife has an issue with most of these behaviors. Mostly the whining but due to the resentment she has gotten from the whining, she takes issue with the dog sleeping on our clothing or even sniffing around whenever we have food. It irritates her to no end. So like whenever the dog starts walking around sniffing us when eating, my wife uses an irritated tone to tell her to get out of the room. Or whenever my wife sees her sleeping on our clothing, she immediately takes the clothes away and says she is ""fucking sick"" of constantly having dog hair on her clothing. I could almost understand if she didn't get as pissed as she does. 

On to the big problem.. yesterday we ate dinner in our bedroom while watching a movie. As soon as Lola saw we had food she came out of her kennel and started sniffing the air and dead pan staring at us while we ate and whined a few times. My wife starts fidgeting but doesn't say anything. Lola starts inching closer to us while staring at my wife because my wife was closest. My wife looks at me and says ""you want to speak to her? Since you get pissed whenever I do."" I told her to just ignore her and act like she isn't there. So my wife just gets up with her plate and says ""I don't fucking want a dog staring at me while I'm eating! I don't even like it when people stare at me so why should I change how I feel or fake it till I make it to accommodate to your dog?"" I told her she was being fucking unbearable. She takes off and doesn't come home. I'm being told I'm an AH for disrespecting my wife's feelings. AITA?

ETA: I don't want this pushed solely off in my favor here so there are a few things I want to point out. I want legit judgement, not biased. My wife wants to get in to therapy but we are trying to save for a house so it's my fault that she hasn't gotten it. I have mentioned a few times whenever she suggests it that we are trying to save for a house so that is my fault that she hasn't yet been to therapy. She will get her therapy eventually however. As for the clothing on the floor issue.. my wife is very tidy. None of her clothing are ever originally on the floor but mine are. Lola does reach up and take my wife's clothing off of the hooks in the closet and makes nests out of them. We do not have a closet door.",my wife has sensory issues shes never been to a doctor for these issues so its truly self diagnosed she thinks that since she hates loud noises and doesnt like being looked at that she has sensory issues not trying to discredit her or anything but its over the top some days like if two people are talking at once she gets super overwhelmed and irritated or as mentioned above if anyone or any thing is looking at her she gets self conscious and pissed off on to the real issue i got a dog about a year ago her name is lola and she is a corgi shes very energetic and needy but training is going well my wife has a cat whom we have had for like years i believe she has always had a problem with my dog reason being is the fact that my dog is needy she loves being touched she wants to follow us everywhere she whines when she wants attention she will sleep on any article of clothing we have on the floor that has our scent before sleeping on her dog bedkennel she is constantly sniffing the airfloor whenever we are eating and often sniffs the trash can or litter box but my wife has an issue with most of these behaviors mostly the whining but due to the resentment she has gotten from the whining she takes issue with the dog sleeping on our clothing or even sniffing around whenever we have food it irritates her to no end so like whenever the dog starts walking around sniffing us when eating my wife uses an irritated tone to tell her to get out of the room or whenever my wife sees her sleeping on our clothing she immediately takes the clothes away and says she is fucking sick of constantly having dog hair on her clothing i could almost understand if she didnt get as pissed as she does on to the big problem yesterday we ate dinner in our bedroom while watching a movie as soon as lola saw we had food she came out of her kennel and started sniffing the air and dead pan staring at us while we ate and whined a few times my wife starts fidgeting but doesnt say anything lola starts inching closer to us while staring at my wife because my wife was closest my wife looks at me and says you want to speak to her since you get pissed whenever i do i told her to just ignore her and act like she isnt there so my wife just gets up with her plate and says i dont fucking want a dog staring at me while im eating i dont even like it when people stare at me so why should i change how i feel or fake it till i make it to accommodate to your dog i told her she was being fucking unbearable she takes off and doesnt come home im being told im an ah for disrespecting my wifes feelings  eta i dont want this pushed solely off in my favor here so there are a few things i want to point out i want legit judgement not biased my wife wants to get in to therapy but we are trying to save for a house so its my fault that she hasnt gotten it i have mentioned a few times whenever she suggests it that we are trying to save for a house so that is my fault that she hasnt yet been to therapy she will get her therapy eventually however as for the clothing on the floor issue my wife is very tidy none of her clothing are ever originally on the floor but mine are lola does reach up and take my wifes clothing off of the hooks in the closet and makes nests out of them we do not have a closet door,662,YTA

1660,yrjzny,AITA for calling out my ex's new wife for being unemployed,calling out my exs new wife for being unemployed,"This is a weird title but here's what actually happened. My ex and I broke up 5 years ago after a year-long relationship, he broke up with me and I took it very hard back then. I can't say I did anything crazy, aside from a few weeks after the break up getting really drunk on a night out and sending him some embarrassing texts. It was the worst heartbreak I've ever had, and it didn't help that he kept messaging me to be ""friends"" even though I tried to set boundaries and say I need space to heal. 

Anyways, that's all in the past. I can confidently say that I have indeed healed from that and am over him. He recently got married to a girl he started dating like 2 months after we broke up. Honestly, I'm happy for him. Good for them. Me, on the other hand, I've dated since then but haven't been able to find anyone worth marrying; I haven't even had another serious relationship since him. 

He's still in the periphery of my social circle, because we still have a lot of mutual friends from uni. And sometimes I see both of them in social settings. While he and I have buried the hatchet and usually just chat when we happen to be in the same room for a bit (although we never text or meet up outside of these contexts), his wife and I have always treated each other with polite disinterest. I know she really doesn't like me. An important note about her is that she's been unemployed for a loooong time. Idk if its because she wants to be a stay-at-home-wife (completely valid choice if that's her thing!) or because she's been unable to find work, but she hasn't worked in many years despite having a masters degree. I've been really able to advance in my career in the past 5 years, and I'm quite far ahead in my field for someone my age and I'm very proud of myself because I worked extremely hard. 

Anyways here's the issue: the other day a bunch of people went for drinks. I came. They were both there. We were all sitting at the same table in a bar. Someone I haven't seen in awhile asked me if I'm dating anyone. I replied ""no, not right now."" My ex's wife quickly made a snark comment ""aw it's okay, some people just stay single"" in front of everyone, like 10 of our friends.  Without missing a beat, I blurted out ""yeah just like some people are meant to stay unemployed"". 

She got really upset, cried and left. Her husband messaged me that I should apologize to her for embarrassing her. I said I will if she apologizes first. He said she refused because what I said was worse, apparently.

1677,yrlpv0,AITA for eating my daughter's sandwich?,eating my daughters sandwich,"My middle daughter (18) and my MIL go out every Tuesday. My daughter picks MIL up after her class is over, they go shopping, then they go out to eat. MIL always pays. 

I'm not stoked about my daughter spending this much time with MIL because MIL clearly favors middle. She always denies having a favorite but she does subtle things like always saying yes if middle wants to go out, even if she just said no to another grandkid but she'll try to make it seem like middle asked first. Middle was also wearing these ""fake"" diamond earrings that she said she bought at a craft fair but they look very similar to my MIL's diamond earrings. Since she's getting older, she's been inviting all of her grandkids over to take her jewelry but middle walks around with jewelry that wasn't up for grabs for the other kids. 

Anyways, on Tuesday middle and MIL went to a deli that's famous for their sandwiches. They each got a sandwich but they're huge so middle only ate half and MIL ate a third. MIL doesn't eat leftovers so she told middle to take the sandwiches home and let someone else eat hers. 

I got home and middle showed me MIL's sandwich and told me I can take it for lunch, so yesterday I took a sandwich and left for work. Middle called me during my lunch and told me that I took her sandwich. She asked me to come home and get the one I was supposed to take but that would take half my lunch break so I said no. She started to get upset and said that she really wanted to eat that sandwich for lunch but I told her I wouldn't be able to go home and switch the sandwiches. Then Middle said either I have to return her sandwich or go to the deli and buy her a new one. I'm not driving 30 minutes to spend $20 on a sandwich. 

Middle started crying because she ""really wanted that sandwich"" and hung up on me. I guess her next move was to call MIL and tell her what happened because when I came home, there was a new sandwich in the fridge with middle's name on it and I got an angry text from FIL's phone.

1678,yrq8if,AITA For refusing to put my 2 dogs in a long-term kennel,refusing to put my dogs in a longterm kennel,"I (28F) live with my BF (27M) of 3 years.  I have 2 large Bernese Mountain dogs.  I've had them both for longer than I've been with my BF.  They are like my babies.  My BF likes them, but he doesn't do much in regards to caring for them.  We live in a duplex and don't really have a yard, so I have to walk them or take them to a dog park to get their energy out. I work from home so it's pretty easy for me to take them out for a 15-30 minute walk on breaks or lunch and then a longer walk after work. My BF very, very rarely takes my dogs out.  Sure, he'll feed them and give them water, but he doesn't really play with them or do anything else to care for them.

Last week I received some bad news.  My grandma, who lives about a 12-hour drive away, had a fall and broke her hip.  She lives on her own and doesn't have anyone else to care for her.  My parents live overseas and aren't in a position to come back to help her.  I'm literally the only person she has that can help.  So, of course I volunteered to go take care of her.  I took a leave of absence from my job (they've been very understanding and I'm so grateful).  

I told my BF my plan to go help my grandma and told him that he's going to have to take care of my dogs while I'm gone.  His first question was how long I am going to be gone, but I don't have an answer for that.  There's not really a timetable for how long my grandma is going to need help.  I am going to look into caregivers when I get there, but I have no idea how long that will take.  I don't like that it's open-ended either, but my grandma needs help and I'm the only one who can give it.

My BF told me he doesn't want the responsibility of taking care of my dogs and that I should put them in a long-term kennel while I'm gone.  He said that I'm asking too much of him and that he doesn't think he can give them the proper care.  He doesn't work from home and has a 45-minute commute, so he's going to be out of the house for about 10 hours every day.  He said he's not going to have the energy to walk them when he gets home.  

I explained to him that I can't afford to kennel them for so long, especially when I don't know how long I'll be gone.  I don't have anyone else that can take them in or come stay with us either.  I explained to him that I need his help right now just like my grandma needs my help.  I told him I know this isn't ideal, but it's something we need to work through together.  

He isn't refusing to help with my dogs, but he's made it very clear he doesn't want to do it.  I'm trying to make it as easy as possible for him by teaching him everything my dogs need, but he's constantly rolling his eyes or giving me a hard time about it and keeps bringing up his kennel idea.  

Finally, I just snapped at him and told him that I'm already stressed out enough as it is and that I don't need him adding extra stress right now.  I told him that taking care of my dogs is not hard and that he's just going to have to suck it up.",i f live with my bf m of years i have large bernese mountain dogs ive had them both for longer than ive been with my bf they are like my babies my bf likes them but he doesnt do much in regards to caring for them we live in a duplex and dont really have a yard so i have to walk them or take them to a dog park to get their energy out i work from home so its pretty easy for me to take them out for a minute walk on breaks or lunch and then a longer walk after work my bf very very rarely takes my dogs out sure hell feed them and give them water but he doesnt really play with them or do anything else to care for them last week i received some bad news my grandma who lives about a hour drive away had a fall and broke her hip she lives on her own and doesnt have anyone else to care for her my parents live overseas and arent in a position to come back to help her im literally the only person she has that can help so of course i volunteered to go take care of her i took a leave of absence from my job theyve been very understanding and im so grateful i told my bf my plan to go help my grandma and told him that hes going to have to take care of my dogs while im gone his first question was how long i am going to be gone but i dont have an answer for that theres not really a timetable for how long my grandma is going to need help i am going to look into caregivers when i get there but i have no idea how long that will take i dont like that its openended either but my grandma needs help and im the only one who can give it my bf told me he doesnt want the responsibility of taking care of my dogs and that i should put them in a longterm kennel while im gone he said that im asking too much of him and that he doesnt think he can give them the proper care he doesnt work from home and has a minute commute so hes going to be out of the house for about hours every day he said hes not going to have the energy to walk them when he gets home i explained to him that i cant afford to kennel them for so long especially when i dont know how long ill be gone i dont have anyone else that can take them in or come stay with us either i explained to him that i need his help right now just like my grandma needs my help i told him i know this isnt ideal but its something we need to work through together he isnt refusing to help with my dogs but hes made it very clear he doesnt want to do it im trying to make it as easy as possible for him by teaching him everything my dogs need but hes constantly rolling his eyes or giving me a hard time about it and keeps bringing up his kennel idea finally i just snapped at him and told him that im already stressed out enough as it is and that i dont need him adding extra stress right now i told him that taking care of my dogs is not hard and that hes just going to have to suck it up,607,YTA

I (18F) am a very giving person. I show love through gifts. I tend to go all out; wrapping paper, gift bags, tissue paper– you get the idea. Most of the time, I do not care to get anything in return— but recently i have been trying to not be so giving to people that aren't deserving of my expenses and efforts. 

My sister is 21. I don't know if it's because she is family or because of how we were treated differently as little kids, but every time i gift her something, i end up with an insane amount of guilt for the days following. 

2-3 years ago i bought her a ps4 game bundle that came with a figuring for christmas. 6 months ago for her birthday i got her some stuff for her nintendo switch. I'd understand if she kept them in the packaging as a collectors item, but they've all been sitting in the same spot in our living room since she opened them. 

My sister has never gifted me anything without my mom telling her to. normally, i wouldn't care– but it's just hurtful that i put all this effort into her gifts just for them to sit and collect dust. 

i told my mom i was going to return them to get my money back. she told me it was rude. i don't think my sister would notice they're gone, but my mom is insisting on letting my sister know that i'm taking them back. i told her that was fine, as long as she tells her why i am taking them back.

honestly at this point i don't really care if i'm being an asshole. i just wanna know what others would do in my position.

1685,yrrojm,AITA for calling my sister selfish for announcing her pregnancy at our parents house?,calling my sister selfish for announcing her pregnancy at our parents house,"


My husband and I have been having a long struggle with infertility. We have been getting treated and trying for a baby since 2017. But nothing worked! My husband is understandably devastated as he'd always wanted kids but never got the chance to be a father.


He's super sensitive aroubd the infertility topic. This my family knows. Days ago, we got together with family for dinner. All of a sudden, my sister and her husband announced that they were expecting. We were stunned, me and my husband I mean. As for the others they were thrilled. As everyone got up to congratulate them. My husband got up, pushed his chair to the side and walked out. They all stared at me but I got up and told my sister she messed up by announcing her pregnancy like this and with 0 consideration for my husband knowing how he feels about this topic. She got defensive saying his ""issues"" with the topic wasn't her problem and that she and her husband were fed up walking on eggshells around him. I called her selfish and cruel but she complained that he ruined their joy and that I made it worse by making a scene.

1686,yrt3ma,AITA for asking my girlfriend not to swim in the morning?,asking my girlfriend not to swim in the morning,"We, 26M and 23F rent a place from her family, said place has a swimming pool.

We have a 2.5 year old.

My brother and his girlfriend are visiting (30 and 32)

My girlfriend likes to swim in the morning from about 6-630, and then for another 10-15 minutes she swims with our daughter because it’s a good bonding experience as well as exercise for both of them.

We’ve never had any complaints from neighbours, my girlfriend isn’t exactly loud but our daughter can be, not every morning and as much noise as you’d expect from a toddler.

My brother’s girlfriend asked if we’d stop this for just while they’re staying due to noise and the fact she’s a light sleeper, plus my girlfriend spends every Sunday in the pool and she and my brother don’t feel comfortable being around her in her swimming costume (but then said “but the noise and not being able to sleep are important”) she did ask very nicely, I joked “at least she’s wearing a swimming costume while you’re here!” But I did ask my girlfriend because I know my brothers girlfriend has complained for a while about her sleeping problems.

But my girlfriend says it’s a perfectly reasonable time, citing that she’s silent till 630 and “her house so until neighbours complain!” But I just think it’s an easy request to maybe change it from 6-630 to 630-7 or something, well  she’s upset with me and things are tense but I knew had I not asked things would be awkward with family, over such a simple thing.

1706,yrw01o,AITA for saying my step daughter could be more popular if she just tried?,saying my step daughter could be more popular if she just tried,"I am the step mother to a 16 year old daughter. I have been her step mom for 6 years. I love my step daughter and think she is a good kid. For instance, she’s polite, in the top 5% of her class, doesn’t get into trouble, helps with house work proactively and is extremely compassionate, probably more so than the average teenager is at 16. She has her eyes set on being valedictorian.

The thing is with her, is that she’s only had the same steady group of friends (2-4 other kids) since elementary school, which is fine. But as opposed to doing what seems normal among kids her age, she is perpetually upstairs in her room on her laptop, For the past three years I have watched her actively decide against going to prom, home-coming, any party or outing even with her own friends etc. She doesn’t wear makeup, she dresses extremely homely in exclusively sweat pants, and outside of going to school everyday, she doesn’t leave the house. Like I said, she does have a handful of friends who come over sometimes. Teachers have said in the past that she is polite to them but quiet and prefers to work alone. She doesn’t socialize well with the other kids and I’m told she is bullied for a speech impediment. Even when her friends are over she just sits in silence.

The other day at the dinner table I offered to take her on a shopping spree for her birthday to get some more adult makeup and some clothes, and it took some convincing but today after school, we went. I mentioned to her how nice it would be to get dolled up together for thanksgiving at her grandparents and she told me it’s not really her thing but that she would try and dress up a little. Naturally, she picked out a giant turtle neck that was 3 sizes too big and swallowed her whole. It wasn’t what I had in mind but a step in the right direction, so we got it and left.

In the car on the way home I asked her what she thought about going to prom this year, even just with friends just to make the memories and have the photos to look back on, and she said she has no interest in that. I tried to ease into the conversation and verbatim told her:

 “Look, you’re a really pretty and smart girl and I’m just worried that in a few years you’ll have nothing to look back on. You aren’t making the memories or connections that most other girls your age make, and I think that maybe if you just put in a little more effort into yourself and stepped out of your shell a little bit, you could easily be your absolute best self. You could be so much more popular if you just tried.”

She immediately started crying and asking me what I thought was wrong with her and why I thought she was “the worst or something” and no matter how much I tried to explain, she just wouldn’t stop crying. When we got home, my husband hounded me and told me I was just contributing to what she already deals with at school, when I personally felt like I made good points and articulated them in a healthy way.",i am the step mother to a year old daughter i have been her step mom for years i love my step daughter and think she is a good kid for instance she’s polite in the top of her class doesn’t get into trouble helps with house work proactively and is extremely compassionate probably more so than the average teenager is at she has her eyes set on being valedictorian the thing is with her is that she’s only had the same steady group of friends other kids since elementary school which is fine but as opposed to doing what seems normal among kids her age she is perpetually upstairs in her room on her laptop for the past three years i have watched her actively decide against going to prom homecoming any party or outing even with her own friends etc she doesn’t wear makeup she dresses extremely homely in exclusively sweat pants and outside of going to school everyday she doesn’t leave the house like i said she does have a handful of friends who come over sometimes teachers have said in the past that she is polite to them but quiet and prefers to work alone she doesn’t socialize well with the other kids and i’m told she is bullied for a speech impediment even when her friends are over she just sits in silence the other day at the dinner table i offered to take her on a shopping spree for her birthday to get some more adult makeup and some clothes and it took some convincing but today after school we went i mentioned to her how nice it would be to get dolled up together for thanksgiving at her grandparents and she told me it’s not really her thing but that she would try and dress up a little naturally she picked out a giant turtle neck that was sizes too big and swallowed her whole it wasn’t what i had in mind but a step in the right direction so we got it and left in the car on the way home i asked her what she thought about going to prom this year even just with friends just to make the memories and have the photos to look back on and she said she has no interest in that i tried to ease into the conversation and verbatim told her “look you’re a really pretty and smart girl and i’m just worried that in a few years you’ll have nothing to look back on you aren’t making the memories or connections that most other girls your age make and i think that maybe if you just put in a little more effort into yourself and stepped out of your shell a little bit you could easily be your absolute best self you could be so much more popular if you just tried” she immediately started crying and asking me what i thought was wrong with her and why i thought she was “the worst or something” and no matter how much i tried to explain she just wouldn’t stop crying when we got home my husband hounded me and told me i was just contributing to what she already deals with at school when i personally felt like i made good points and articulated them in a healthy way,557,YTA

Hello all, I have 2 daughters named Kate (23F) and Alexa (16F). For starters Kate lives with me rent free and bill free. She used to live with her mother full time but her mom kicked her out at 18. I don’t blame her mother though. Kate was absolutely terrible in her teenager years. She was rude, disrespectful and would steal,smoke, skip class,etc. Kate barely finished high school and was put in a continuation school. Since this though Kate is doing a lot better, she didn’t want to go to college but she works at a fast food restaurant and is saving up for her own apartment. 

Alexa on the other hand is the opposite, she’s amazing in school, works, volunteers  and still has time to do sports and clubs. I’m extremely proud of her and feel as if she puts too much pressure on herself. Me and my girlfriend decided to surprise her on a vacation. Alexa has always wanted to go there and it wasn’t as pricey as we expected. We planned this in early October.

I told Kate about the vacation and asked if she wanted to come, but she would have to pay her own ticket.She said yes and would give me the money before Halloween. Well she never gave me the money even after being reminded, so I booked the trip November 1 for the 18-21 of November. I told my daughter this Sunday at dinner and she was very excited, Kate then said “ you’ll have to cancel and hope they refund. I work those days.” I told her she wasn’t coming since she didn’t pay. She was confused and thought I was paying for her. I told her that she was an adult who worked and lived  free, why would I pay. She got upset and said because I’m her daughter and that I was paying for Alexa so why not her. An argument then happened which resulted in Alexa and Kate crying and Kate saying she hated me.

 Kate has been ignoring us until we apologize and pay her ticket, which I won’t. Well yesterday Alexa sent me a link to a video on tick Tock where it shows Kate crying and explaining the situation, but she lied about a lot of things in the videos and made Alexa and I look like bad guys. The video got a lot of attention and support. She even opened up a go fund me where she received close to 500 dollars. I showed my girlfriend and we were both livid, Alexa was also very upset about the comments which fueled my anger. When she came home a huge argument broke out and I basically kicked her out for the week. 

She’s been posting on social media platforms talking about me, my daughter and girlfriend. My daughter even got some nasty messages on her social media. My girlfriend told me I’m right on this but my daughter told me to just pay for her ticket.

We bought him a new sedan, it was a little over 30k. He was very appreciative, though he said he didn't need a brand new one. Everything was in his name.







Almost immediately he sells it to carmax and gets some old cheap no frills sedan with roll-up windows. We were floored, he said it was to help him pay for college, which was weird because we agreed we would help him split the costs. He probably made at least 22k in profit from doing this.






We feel this was a total slap in the face, and we told him how disrespected ~~he~~ *we* felt, but he said, and I quote, ""If I'm going to survive long-term in the 21st century, I need to save as much as possible."" Does this really mean you have to sell gifts other people give you?

1714,ys2lpz,AITA for “kicking” my girlfriend out my my room because my son had a migraine?,“kicking” my girlfriend out my my room because my son had a migraine,"My son and only child has struggled with migraines since he was about six. He just turned 13 two weeks ago. Every time he gets one, which isn’t very often now, we have the same routine. He soaks in the tub with the lights off while I throw a pair of underwear in the dryer. 
Once he gets out, I give him a warm or cold cloth, depending on what he wants, and he’ll get into my bed. He likes being close to me whenever these happen, and I’ll massage his head until he falls asleep. The other night, he started to get a migraine. When he was in the bath, I told my girlfriend, who was staying the night, that he sleeps with me whenever these happen. I told her politely that if she didn’t feel comfortable, then she would have to leave. His bed is too small to fit both of us, so that wasn’t really an option. 
She decided that she would go home but was upset about it. He was still feeling bad the next day, so I called her and let her know that he’d probably still be sleeping with me tonight and that I would be in between them the entire time. 
She said no and that she didn’t feel comfortable sharing a bed with a teenager. I said that was completely fine and I’ll call her whenever he was feeling better.

1719,ys7a08,"AITA for telling my cousin that playing her ""sport"" in college isn't some kind of achievement.",telling my cousin that playing her sport in college isnt some kind of achievement,"About 6 months ago, my (21F) cousin ""Lily"" (18F) committed to the university of her choice, and around the same time, she signed on to the university's cheerleading program. I remember the day my entire family celebrating this as if being a cheerleader in college was some kind of major accomplishment or whatever. It was somewhat weird too, considering that even other people who sign on to play other sports in college, ones that take a lot of energy and practice to not get the same reactions, but whatever. Anyway, Lily signed on, everyone celebrated and in August, she left for college. Ever since then Lily has been going on to social media and essentially made cheerleading her entire personality, and acting like it's the best thing in the world, even though she has been in cheer since her freshman year of high school, and there's really not that much of a difference between her college program and her high school program. The average person would look at her posts and think that she's not even in college, since so far, I have seen virtually nothing related to her academics. You know, the thing that she's actually spending money at the college to do?

I'm currently in college as well (a different one), and last week I went home to visit my family. Coincidentally, Lily decided to go home at the same time. We had dinner with our extended family, during which Lily decided to go on and on about her ""sport"" and how it's the best thing ever, and how she loves it. Which is great and all, but I asked her what she actually wants to do with her life, what career she thinks she's going into, what options she's thinking about etc. Lily said that she didn't know exactly what she wanted to do, but she's trying to narrow it down. I told her that hearing that was kind of a relief for me, since she actually wants to do something productive in her life instead of clapping her hands and yelling. Lily got defensive and said that cheerleading was more than just that and that it's been her entire lifestyle so far. I told Lily that she could like cheer all she wants but at the end of the day, it's not some kind of achievement that most people would respect, and how there are people who play actual sports who know that it's not something that you can pursue as a career and she should take the education that she's paying thousands of dollars for and make real acheivements with that. Lily got really quiet and then left the dinner table early. After she left, I had some family members go off on me for ""hurting her feelings."" I was just seeing this as a wake up call. My uncle agreed with my statement and said that there plenty of things that Lily needs to think about, It's been about a week since this happened and Lily is refusing to answer any of my texts.

1728,ysbg8c,AITA defending my husband after a prank went horribly wrong,defending my husband after a prank went horribly wrong,"My husband, Jayden (26), loves jokes and pranks and stuff. I'll admit I'm not one for them, and find most of them dumb, but our daughter Lucy (5) loves them. They basically do a bunch of stupid pranks to each other, and to be fair Jayden does keep it harmless. Last month we got some realistic looking spider toys with other decorations. Since we got them, Jayden and Lucy have basically taken turns putting them around the house to scare each other or me. I honestly find it annoying but the two of them love it. Lucy does usually get scared, but when she realises what it is she laughs and finds it funny or tells her dad off (it's actually adorable when she tells him off though), and Jayden always pretends he is scared even when she gives it away beforehand by giggling and watching him. 

So about two weeks ago Jayden set it to fall on her when she opened her toybox in the playroom. Lucy didn't open it and apparently he forgot it. Later that week we had my family over including my brother Leon, and my nieces (Tara 3 and Zoe 6) over. Zoe was badly bitten by a spider when she was younger, even had to go to the hospital. Since then she is deathly afraid of them, I would go as far as to call it a phobia. 

The kids went to play and the spiders fell on them. Zoe completely freaked out and just melted down. We came down and saw what happened. Jayden did apologise and try to cheer her up, but Leon was furious. He basically accused us of doing it on purpose, that we should know better and just calling us assholes. We did apologise and explained that it wasn't meant for Zoe, but my brother did not listen to him at all. Leon left early with my SIL and nieces, and the whole night was kind of ruined.

I've tried to talk.to him after, but Leon is still pretty pissed with us. It's been a week and he's still acting like we tried to murder Zoe. I've tried explaining again that it was an accident and mistake. But he basically thinks it's too convenient a mistake, and that if it is Jayden is still an asshole for being so immature and I'm an asshole for defending him.

It was meant to be for Lucy who likes these stupid pranks. I think Leon's overreacting and he thinks I just don't really care about my niece.",my husband jayden loves jokes and pranks and stuff ill admit im not one for them and find most of them dumb but our daughter lucy loves them they basically do a bunch of stupid pranks to each other and to be fair jayden does keep it harmless last month we got some realistic looking spider toys with other decorations since we got them jayden and lucy have basically taken turns putting them around the house to scare each other or me i honestly find it annoying but the two of them love it lucy does usually get scared but when she realises what it is she laughs and finds it funny or tells her dad off its actually adorable when she tells him off though and jayden always pretends he is scared even when she gives it away beforehand by giggling and watching him so about two weeks ago jayden set it to fall on her when she opened her toybox in the playroom lucy didnt open it and apparently he forgot it later that week we had my family over including my brother leon and my nieces tara and zoe over zoe was badly bitten by a spider when she was younger even had to go to the hospital since then she is deathly afraid of them i would go as far as to call it a phobia the kids went to play and the spiders fell on them zoe completely freaked out and just melted down we came down and saw what happened jayden did apologise and try to cheer her up but leon was furious he basically accused us of doing it on purpose that we should know better and just calling us assholes we did apologise and explained that it wasnt meant for zoe but my brother did not listen to him at all leon left early with my sil and nieces and the whole night was kind of ruined ive tried to talkto him after but leon is still pretty pissed with us its been a week and hes still acting like we tried to murder zoe ive tried explaining again that it was an accident and mistake but he basically thinks its too convenient a mistake and that if it is jayden is still an asshole for being so immature and im an asshole for defending him so now he basically refuses to see us unless jayden is banned which is ridiculous i do feel bad that it went so wrong and i understand that it was horrible mistake but it wasnt meant to happen it was meant to be for lucy who likes these stupid pranks i think leons overreacting and he thinks i just dont really care about my niece,459,NAH
1729,ysd99c,WIBTA to ask someone to return a baby gift i want a more expensive version of?,wibta to ask someone to return a baby gift i want a more expensive version of,"
im having my first child in a couple of weeks and my in laws asked what i was missing to buy for the baby. i sent a link to a playpen that i wanted to get for the baby which is $125 on sale from $180. it is the color i want, with music and vibration features. it has multiple pockets and a big space for pampers bottles etc. plus it has near perfect reviews. yesterday my SIL showed me the one they got me which is $90 but in a color i don’t like, with a smaller area to put baby things and no outside pocket. it was like they didn’t put in the effort to order the one i wanted and ordered the first one they saw at target. personally i feel awkward with these things and just said thank you and its cute but i truly don’t want it. 

WIBTA to request they return it and get the one i asked for and sent the link to?


edit: some people seem to think im being entitled so maybe i didn’t give enough information. the playpen i actually wanted is only $35 more than the one they got which means less than $20 a person would be spent extra. and why ask for what i want if you’re going to get whatever you want? im due in two weeks… they had months to get me the more affordable things on my registry. when they facetimed me to show me the gift they said that they liked the one they chose better because it was cute…. not because of monetary reasons. something cute over something i researched and picked out…. 

and if i just return it without them knowing they will be hurt when they see i don’t have it in my house

edit again: its not about money for all the “maybe they couldn’t afford it” ppl. they offered me to buy a $200 present that i already had and i told them so. so they asked what specifically was left that i needed. i send them a link to something that cost $70 below what they would have bought me had i not already had it. they just wanted to get me what THEY LIKED. just because they liked the design more. 

and i can’t return something to target and pay the difference to get what i want from amazon. thats why i can’t return it myself.",im having my first child in a couple of weeks and my in laws asked what i was missing to buy for the baby i sent a link to a playpen that i wanted to get for the baby which is on sale from it is the color i want with music and vibration features it has multiple pockets and a big space for pampers bottles etc plus it has near perfect reviews yesterday my sil showed me the one they got me which is but in a color i don’t like with a smaller area to put baby things and no outside pocket it was like they didn’t put in the effort to order the one i wanted and ordered the first one they saw at target personally i feel awkward with these things and just said thank you and its cute but i truly don’t want it wibta to request they return it and get the one i asked for and sent the link to edit some people seem to think im being entitled so maybe i didn’t give enough information the playpen i actually wanted is only more than the one they got which means less than a person would be spent extra and why ask for what i want if you’re going to get whatever you want im due in two weeks… they had months to get me the more affordable things on my registry when they facetimed me to show me the gift they said that they liked the one they chose better because it was cute… not because of monetary reasons something cute over something i researched and picked out… and if i just return it without them knowing they will be hurt when they see i don’t have it in my house edit again its not about money for all the “maybe they couldn’t afford it” ppl they offered me to buy a present that i already had and i told them so so they asked what specifically was left that i needed i send them a link to something that cost below what they would have bought me had i not already had it they just wanted to get me what they liked just because they liked the design more and i can’t return something to target and pay the difference to get what i want from amazon thats why i can’t return it myself,403,YTA
1738,ysdtlk,AITA for yelling at my DnD group over myself being late?,yelling at my dnd group over myself being late,"So I made this DnD group a while back to play with my friends and it's changed a lot over the past few months, mainly I went from DM to player because I just wasn't having fun as DM.

So enough backstory on to the situation. I live with my grandma and often help her with her little home improvement projects. This one involved putting up a railing, and I was unaware that it would take as long as it did and was late to DND. I was also unable to text too much, just little snip its. One of my party mates, I will refer to as Amy, started to spam @ to me on discord. I quickly say ""I'm busy"" because that's all I have time to type. So the dm asks how am I busy, and I don't see the message because I am holding up the railing and not looking at my phone. So Amy starts to spam me again, but I holding the railing steady with the same leg I have my phone in the pocket of. So the vibration of my phone causes my leg to twitch and completely unaligned the railing. My grandma proceeds to to start yelling and getting pissed, which I understand this took forever to get set up, and I quickly text my party to ""Fuck off, I'm busy dipshits"". After I do so I shut off my phone so it doesn't happen again, and it takes another hour to get everything set up and drill all the screws in place. I turn my phone back on afterwards and Amy and the DM are pissed at me asking for my apologies for erupting at them. I do apologize but it feels wrong to me that they didn't apologize to me. After all that I wasn't in the mood to play DND so I didn't show and then Amy gets pissed because I didn't want to play. So after all of this Am I the AssholE?

EDIT: Apologies for all this as this is my first post but I forgot a few key details. 1) The group is online. 2) When I was dm I never expected people to show all the time. 3) other people had been late but this hadn't happened to them. If you have other questions let me know and I will do all I can to answer

EDIT 2: I understand I am the ah for swearing at my party, however a lot of people seem to be ignoring the fact that other members of my party have done the exact same thing and no one bat an eye. I honestly feel singed out that I have to give an explanation of my personal life when another person says I'm busy they don't have to say anything.

1739,ysgicj,AITA for asking my wife to apologize to my mom but not vice versa?,asking my wife to apologize to my mom but not vice versa,"My mom and wife have a bad history, lots of issues, but I think it simply boils down to they do not like each other. If they were not family they would never speak, and neither of them cope well with it well. in the past I've stood up for my wife every time my mom was catty.

My wife is currently pregnant and my mom is planning a wedding, so great more tension. Now i fully acknowledge I fucked up here but my wife has been feeling pretty down lately  and I felt she needed to get out. I pressured my mom to take her wedding dress shopping because my wife loves fashion and I'm an idiot who thought maybe they could bond. Also my wife really really wanted to go. She loves clothes and wanted to go to the restaurant they were going to. My mom reluctantly agreed and again I'm a huge idiot.

So they went and my mom came out in a dress and my wife just began sobbing. Being pregnant she cries very easily these days and she was mortified but just couldn't control it. My mom took it badly which i understand, but my mom began telling everyone there that see my wife just hates her, she is crying because she wants my mom to die alone, etc. Then my mom apparently giggled and a few other people laughed. My wife was humiliated and left in an Uber.

my wife explained to me that she was just jealous of the dress/wedding/how thin my mom is as my wife feels like shit. She said she missed being a bride as she loved it so much, and just seeing my mom made her feel worse. I told her I totally get it and we all have irrational moments sometimes, but I can see why my mom took it the way she did and I think my wife should apologize and explain. She asked if I was going to make my mom apologize and I said no, as I can understand why she would think that and I think the laughter was because she was uncomfortable.

My wife blew up and said I was being a mama's boy and trying to shame her for her feelings. She said my mom owes her an apology and until i ""get my head out of my ass and tell her that"" she won't be apologizing. I feel horrible right now.",my mom and wife have a bad history lots of issues but i think it simply boils down to they do not like each other if they were not family they would never speak and neither of them cope well with it well in the past ive stood up for my wife every time my mom was catty my wife is currently pregnant and my mom is planning a wedding so great more tension now i fully acknowledge i fucked up here but my wife has been feeling pretty down lately and i felt she needed to get out i pressured my mom to take her wedding dress shopping because my wife loves fashion and im an idiot who thought maybe they could bond also my wife really really wanted to go she loves clothes and wanted to go to the restaurant they were going to my mom reluctantly agreed and again im a huge idiot so they went and my mom came out in a dress and my wife just began sobbing being pregnant she cries very easily these days and she was mortified but just couldnt control it my mom took it badly which i understand but my mom began telling everyone there that see my wife just hates her she is crying because she wants my mom to die alone etc then my mom apparently giggled and a few other people laughed my wife was humiliated and left in an uber my wife explained to me that she was just jealous of the dressweddinghow thin my mom is as my wife feels like shit she said she missed being a bride as she loved it so much and just seeing my mom made her feel worse i told her i totally get it and we all have irrational moments sometimes but i can see why my mom took it the way she did and i think my wife should apologize and explain she asked if i was going to make my mom apologize and i said no as i can understand why she would think that and i think the laughter was because she was uncomfortable my wife blew up and said i was being a mamas boy and trying to shame her for her feelings she said my mom owes her an apology and until i get my head out of my ass and tell her that she wont be apologizing i feel horrible right now,410,ESH
1741,ysejfr,AITA for getting mad that my “friend” didn’t invite me to her wedding?,getting mad that my “friend” didn’t invite me to her wedding,"First of all im sorry for my english, is my second lenguage. 

I (32F) have known this girl, we will call her Amy(Also 32F) since first grade, we were best friends all through school until we went to different colleges (on the same city).
At 23 we both started dating (i happened to introduce her to her boyfriend), we will call him Mike. At the time everything was fine, but Mike started showing some AH behaviours and Amy tried to end it and couldn’t because he used some manipulative tactics that worked perfectly. All of our common friends told Amy they didn’t like Mike for her, that she deserved better, but she stayed with him.

Our “fallout” happened about 5 years ago, when some friends told me they found Mike on a dating app. Nobody wanted to tell Amy so i did(because if that happened to me i would like to know). The thing is, instead of believing her friend, she told Mike what i told her and from that day on he hated my guts and without words he let me know, with nasty stares, etc.

Fast forward to current events, Amy got engaged, and also i got engaged and my friends threw me a bachelorette party, where i decided on the list (6 friends) that didn’t include Amy (whom i haven’t really talked to or seen for over 2 years) and apparently she was pissed she wasn’t invited. I got married at city hall with only our families and best friends, and that was it, though at a moment we thought of doing something else of about 50 people where she wasn’t going to be invited (only my best friend knew that).

Now is time for her wedding, which is not going to be small (i assume at least 150 people) and i was not invited. It was hurtful considering there is a long relationship that had some rocky places but still. Talking to my best friend, she blames me saying i started it all by not inviting her to my bachelorette where we could have mended things and because i was thinking about doing a small gathering and not inviting her, which i told her didn’t matter because that never happened, it was only a thought.

So, am i the asshole for getting mad i wasn’t invited or is Amy right?

Additional info:
Maybe the part about my wedding wasn’t clear, i only got married at city hall with our inmediate families and one friend each, nothing else. The “bigger” 50 person wedding didn’t happen.

The three oldest grew up with their dad in another state from the ages 8&7.  Their dad kept all contact with me to nothing because of who i was dating. I raised my younger daughter (now 13) who is their half sister and knew before they left to live with their dad. A few years later i had my youngest (now 6F) . Right before COVID hit I had reconnected with my children and started repairing my relationships with them. I went up to the state they were living in to arrange transfer of custody. That fell apart and so I went back home and continued with raising my youngest two, all while keeping in touch with the older three. I became a grandmother and I was ecstatic to have a grandbaby. I was repairing the relationship with my daughter and getting to know my granddaughter.

I had moved to a different part of my state which happened to be closer to my grandchild and daughter. So I was able to see them more. My grandchild came and spent time with me and my younger daughters, getting to now this side of her family. This also gave my daughter a chance to reconnect with her younger sister and get to now her youngest sister. All was well. We were happy. Then it happened.

My sister and I saw a post by daughter saying happy sisters day to her sister that is 19 and other girls she calls her "" sister"". Not anywhere in the post did she recognize her two youngest sister. MY sister and I had made a generalized post on FB about how when you call out one sister you should recognize all sisters. My 13y daughter was crying because her sister did not recognize her as her sister.

My mom never really liked Alana and the wedding as heightened that tension.

My dad recently married his affair partner and the woman he left my mom for. i'll call her ""Gabrielle"" Obviously my siblings and I don't like Gabrielle very much but we do understand she is a packaged deal with my father so she is begrudgingly invited to the wedding.

Alana does not like Gabrielle and thinks she is attention seeking and spoiled. We recently had dinner with my mom and sister and Alana was talking about how she is worried about what Gabrielle would wear to the wedding. My mom asked why she cared and Alana explained it is disrespectful to try and upstage the bride and Gabrielle seems like the type who would do that. She then made, honestly a not nice comment about Gabrielle isn't even as hot as everyone thinks she is, and my dad must just like the sex, because she is pretty but not midlife crisis losing your mind pretty.

My mom looked right at Alana and said ""oh I get it you want to punish her for being prettier than you."" I was in shock and Alana's face dropped. I asked her why she would even defend Gabrielle and she said she doesn't like jealous insecure women. My mom's boyfriend chimed in and said Alana also isn't midlife crisis pretty so why is she even talking. Alana was clearly humiliated and looked like she was going to tear up. She has always been very insecure about her looks.

I yelled at my mom and demanded she apologize. I said she was acting like one of those jealous pathetic MILs and I wasn't going to let her tear Alana down. My mom said no and Alana started it and set the precedent that it was alright to critique other women's appearance. She said Alana is just insecure because Gabrielle or someone else could upstage her, and she doesn't have to coddle an ""insecure little girl"" just because she is going to be her DIL.

We left the restaurant and I told my mom that if she wants to come she needs to apologize, as does her boyfriend, and it needs to be sincere as it is beyond fucked up she would treat Alana like that just for blowing off steam.

Here we are.

My brother posted a few days ago about my wedding. Here's the whole story.

I (35M) asked my half-brother (27M) to be the best man at my wedding because I got into a disagreement with my other brothers over who gets to be my best man. I wanted them to be pissed that neither of them stood with me at all. Not even as groomsmen. AH move. I know.

The day of my wedding was great until he left. He gave quite the emotional best man speech. Brought me to tears if I'm being honest.

The family kept approaching him but he's always been shy. He said hi to some of them but he seemed out of his element. I kept trying to stay with him as much as I could. He, my wife, and his fiancée really hit it off. I was glad. When he excused himself to grab some champagne, I saw our mom approach him, and immediately got worried.

I'd already felt horrible about all the stuff he went through when we were younger, and didn't want him to know the real reason why he was the best man. Our mom kept talking to him, but I couldn't hear what she was saying.

He suddenly looked shocked, and asked me if he was only the best man to make our other siblings pissed. I said yes, I'm not the best liar. I kept apologizing and begging him to forgive me. All of this was away from the guests.

I never said he wasn't getting invited. Our mom did. His invite was one of the first to go out.

He didn't make a scene, but he did leave with his fiancée, everyone saw them leaving and kept questioning us why he left, including my wife. I told her the truth and she got very mad at our mom. The whole atmosphere was awkward from that point on.

I did text him after the wedding. I told him he could've just stayed and then we would've chatted later. But he said that he didn't want to talk to me and blocked me.

The real AH is mostly our mom.

Our sister sent me his post and told me to look at the comments, I was getting bashed left and right. I couldn't text him about it so I thought maybe he'll see this. Still think I'm the AH?",since my halfbrother wanted to bring family issues to social media here we are my brother posted a few days ago about my wedding heres the whole story i m asked my halfbrother m to be the best man at my wedding because i got into a disagreement with my other brothers over who gets to be my best man i wanted them to be pissed that neither of them stood with me at all not even as groomsmen ah move i know the day of my wedding was great until he left he gave quite the emotional best man speech brought me to tears if im being honest the family kept approaching him but hes always been shy he said hi to some of them but he seemed out of his element i kept trying to stay with him as much as i could he my wife and his fiancée really hit it off i was glad when he excused himself to grab some champagne i saw our mom approach him and immediately got worried id already felt horrible about all the stuff he went through when we were younger and didnt want him to know the real reason why he was the best man our mom kept talking to him but i couldnt hear what she was saying he suddenly looked shocked and asked me if he was only the best man to make our other siblings pissed i said yes im not the best liar i kept apologizing and begging him to forgive me all of this was away from the guests i never said he wasnt getting invited our mom did his invite was one of the first to go out he didnt make a scene but he did leave with his fiancée everyone saw them leaving and kept questioning us why he left including my wife i told her the truth and she got very mad at our mom the whole atmosphere was awkward from that point on i did text him after the wedding i told him he couldve just stayed and then we wouldve chatted later but he said that he didnt want to talk to me and blocked me the real ah is mostly our mom our sister sent me his post and told me to look at the comments i was getting bashed left and right i couldnt text him about it so i thought maybe hell see this still think im the ah,413,YTA
1751,yseola,AITA for telling a new employee not to ask me for favors?,telling a new employee not to ask me for favors,"I work as an assistant to the President and VP of our company. We also have bookkeepers and accountants. Our boss doesn't care when we WFH or in the office as long as we get our work done. There are definitely times when we need to be in the office for meetings or mail.

I've been here for four years and had been taken advantage of by people who didn't want to show up to do their office work. I was coming in almost everyday because it made my day go faster. All of a sudden I started getting bombarded by coworkers to do favors so they wouldn't have to come in. 

Basically I was using my office time to do their office work. They just came to expect it so I stopped coming in. I never got a thank you or anything. 

Those who took advantage of me all had one thing in common - they talked about nothing but their kids. The more they talked about their kids, the more ""crises"" they had that prevented them from coming to the office.

For example, one coworker talked forever about how her daughter was going to a new school far away. All of a sudden she's emailing me to do favors because she's stuck in traffic picking up her kid (yes on office hours).

Another example was a coworker talked endlessly about her kid's gymnastics. I start getting calls from her to go through her mail at the office and to scan it because she's at her daughter's gymnastics competition.

They all acted like I ""knew"" about their kid stuff so it was okay.

All of that ended when I stopped coming in and it forced them to come in.

My firm hired a new person and all she talks about is her kid and how she's going through a separation blah blah. It was deja vu. I bluntly told her that she better not call me to do any office favors if she can't come to work because of her kid. She was a bit taken aback but I made my point. I'm happy I did that.

To be clear, I'm NOT the office assistant. I'm here for two people not 50.

Also, like 90% of the things that these people talk about are about their kid. Not work, not the weather, etc. They just bring it up all the time.

Everyone else talks about their kids like 10% of the time and the rest is about work. 

I'm not a kid hater. I'm actually a single dad with a 8yo son. Only three coworkers know about that and I've been here for 4 years.

1756,ysp5fn,AITA for expecting accommodation for my vegan boyfriend from my mom at Thanksgiving?.,expecting accommodation for my vegan boyfriend from my mom at thanksgiving,"

My f24 mom had invited us to thanksgiving with her and the family. I called her saying that I'll accept the invite on one condition and that is to make sure that my vegan boyfriend m25 is accommodated. She asked what that meant and I sent her a list of options to cook for him since he can't be having any meals that contain meat and the main dish at thanksgiving is *obviously* meat. She got back to me later calling ridiculous for expecting her to cook an ""elaborate"" meal for my boyfriend. I told her I was just making sure he'll have something to eat when the time comes but she turned it back on me asking why don't I choose a meal from the list I sent her and cook it for him myself and bring it. This was a hard no from because for one, she's the host. And besides that I'm busy with school and she should consider how I sacrificed my study time to come celebrate thanksgiving with her and the family. She said that I was out of line and hung up. Dad called me and was furious sayin he could not believe this ""attitude"" I'm giving about the whole thing but I said that I was just making sure that my boyfriend *who's a guest* at their event, is accomodated that's all. We had an argument and he hung up upon telling me to get over myself.


We haven't talked after that. My siblings want me to attend but mom thinks it's unfair what I'm asking of her.

Caden's mother got institutionalized a few months after he was born and my ex got full custody. Now I wasn't a mom to him at all, just a responsible adult who cooked meals for him , kept him safe and looked after him when he was sick. 

I finally left my situation was Caden was 3 and I still babysit Caden sometimes because I'm the only one he feels comfortable with other than his own daddy. 

Now after struggling with infertility for years I had a surprise baby with my friend Will. It was a shock for both of us but we decided to embrace the gift and co-parent together. Will is my best friend and his son Aiden (5 year old) is a doting big brother to my daughter (now 7 months old). 

The other day I was babysitting Caden for a few hours when the kids (Caden and Aiden) got into a fight over my daughter.

 Caden told Aiden that my daughter was his sister, and not Aiden's. I gently explained to him that even though he was not my daughter's big brother, he could definitely be her buddy. He was inconsolable. I had to tell him that Aiden was indeed her big brother.

My ex is furious with me for telling him that my daughter isn't his sister. He thinks that my comments were harsh and inappropriate for a 5 year old. I think that my comments were okay. I don't want to confuse a little boy and create expectations and disappointments down the line.

They are taking care of most things but I want to help my brother. I offered a few options and then I thought I could get the cake for them. My brother agreed.

Recently however I saw him and my SIL in person for the first time in a long time (they just had a baby and I was traveling a lot for work during the pregnancy and the last 4 months so we just FaceTimed to keep everyone healthy).

I’m not going to sugar coat it. My future SIL gained A LOT of weight. More than you would see during an average pregnancy and she has not been pregnant for almost 5 months now.

So I had what I thought was a great idea and decided to get a watermelon cake for the wedding rather than a traditional cake. This so SIL can actually have it without feeling bad or guilty or anything like that. Also a little selfishly I do a strict diet and exercise regime so it would be nice if I also could enjoy something I’m paying for.

We were never married and they have custody of my son (informal arrangement, we never went to court or anything but we wanted to both have a relationship with him). He is over a year old now and I have had him for many overnights and we often do things together, including with both our families. I pay for part of his daycare tuition.

I thought things were going well, but today my ex  called me and said they need me to take care of my son all weekend because their relative (not a super close relative) died and they need to go to a funeral out of town and don’t want to have to deal with my son on a plane or at the funeral service. I already had plans to go away for the weekend with friends, so I said no, get a babysitter.

My ex blew up at me and said a family funeral trumps a trip with friends, and that it was selfish, psychopathic and narcissistic of me not to cancel. I have been known to misjudge stuff sometimes, which is why I’m posting here as a self-check, but I really don’t agree, I think I had existing plans, my ex gave me basically no notice, and I can’t bring a baby on this trip (long drive, not appropriate atmosphere).

I thought about how much our sitter came through with everything. He deserves some kind of one time bonus. 

The thing is that my ex has mostly benefitted from our sitter and she should be the one to pay out the bonus. I totally would give a bonus if I had a female sitter helping my daughter bathing and getting dressed because it would feel weird to my daughter to have dad do it (I only two boys).

I spoke to my ex and said she ought to payout our sitter with a generous cash bonus. She agreed but said I should pay half. I disagreed because he's helped her far more than me. 

Currently we pay our sitter separately. I pay him for the days that I have my son's and my ex pays for the days that she has them.

1778,ysxsgm,AITA for telling my wife it's her own fault for not getting invited on a group trip?,telling my wife its her own fault for not getting invited on a group trip,"Me (32M) and my wife (31F) have been together for about 6 years. We get along wonderfully and through everything, have never had any major fights except for one thing.

I personally feel like my wife makes no effort to get along with my friends.

Now to give context, all my friends and I went to the same university for undergrad (3 guys and 3 girls that are married). My wife is the only one that did not have this common trait of attending undergrad between the 8 of us, which is really not a big deal if you ask me.

Early on in our relationship, my friends would always try and be friendly to her and talk to her when we would mutually hang out. My wife was cordial, but you could tell that she was uncomfortable. I would speak with her about this, and she would always comment that she was an “outsider” to all of us.

This always personally made me slightly miffed because I felt that my friends always made an effort to include her and make sure that she wasn’t singled out.

Throughout the years, my wife would attend events with me but would seem distant and would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned. My friends never said anything but were always nice and treated her kindly.

Well this week I got a group text from my friends about planning a group vacation to somewhere next year. I quickly noticed my wife wasn’t on the group text and asked about it. I got a call from one of my friends who basically said that they didn’t invite my wife because:

1.	Based on all the previous interactions they didn’t think she would want to attend 
2.	Even if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don’t want it to ruin the vacation 

I thanked my friend for his honesty and told him I’d think about it. And while I love my wife, I figured she more than likely wouldn’t want to go on a vacation with them.

So I told my wife about the trip, and she asked about details. I told her that while I was invited, she wasn’t, and it wasn’t because of anything she did, but because they thought she wouldn’t want to attend.

Well this statement just seemed to about how she is an outsider. She said that because of the history us 7 had together, she had no chance of ever being a part of the group. She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn’t want to be there because she is my wife.

I sat there and listened to her vent and then finally I calmly told her that it was pretty much her own fault for not being invited, because she had taken such a hostile stance with them from the get go. She became a self fulfilling prophecy about being an outsider. That’s paraphrasing but something along those lines. 

She left the house and went to her mothers.

I haven’t spoken to her in several days despite texts and phone calls to try and talk to her. I probably should have been more diplomatic about what I said, but I do feel my friends have been treated unfairly.

I won't say what they are out of respect for her privacy but she's in and out of the hospital and is being monitored almost 24/7 at home. 

Everly was just in the hospital and came home yesterday. When my husband took her home, he got distracted with a work call and I was with our 3 month old so my mom got her something to eat and tucked her in for a nap. When my husband was done with his call he went into Everly's room to check on her. She was supposed to be asleep so he didn't knock because he didn't want to wake her up. When he went in Everly dove under the covers and told him to get me or my mom. He got me and I checked on her and gave her meds. She explained that she kicked my husband out because she was topless and panicked when she came in (she had a shirt on by the time I came in). She and I talked about it then I went to tell my husband that everything was fine and she wasn't mad. I explained the situation to him and he was relieved that he hadn't done anything wrong and that she wasn't upset but he was confused why she was comfortable with me coming in when I've only been in her life for 3 years, especially when she's never been uncomfortable with him before. 

I told him that she's 14 and things are changing and she might want to talk to me about certain things and she might change her mind on what she's comfortable with.

1785,ysxs6m,AITA- Stepsister will not speak to me years after not attending her wedding,stepsister will not speak to me years after not attending her wedding,"I was invited to attend my little stepsister’s wedding a few years back. Our families were blended at a young age, so there’s a natural sense of closeness growing up together in our family. At the time, I was expecting to be out of town for military training when I received an invitation. So I let her know well in advance that I wouldn’t be able to attend. 

When the weekend of the wedding came, I had forgotten about the date of the event because I wasn’t going anyway. It was also a long weekend where I was afforded a 4-day break from my training. I decided last minute to purchase a plane ticket and fly across the country to visit my girlfriend at the time. On the second day of my long weekend (the day of my little stepsister’s wedding), my father called me to chit-chat about my training I had been doing. I let him know it was fun and challenging but stressful still. I also mentioned to him that I took advantage of the long weekend and flew back home.

He politely mentioned that it’s my little sister’s wedding today and that I had plenty of time to attend still. Looking at my watch, I had two hours before it started. It’s also a two hour drive. Even if I dropped everything I was doing and immediately left, I’d be late and stressed about the whole ordeal. I wanted to relax and clear my mind from the stress of training. I had just finished working out, I wasn’t ready for the day, I hadn’t prepared any decent clothes for the wedding, and simply put: I just wasn’t willing to change my plans last minute for an event I wasn’t planning on attending anyway. I told my dad I wasn’t coming. 

Somewhere along the conversation with my dad, word got out I was back in the state. My littlest stepsister called and asked me to please come. I politely declined. I didn’t give an excuse because I knew it wouldn’t matter to her. So I didn’t show up to my stepsister’s wedding. I enjoyed the rest of my weekend, then flew back to my training and completed it successfully.

Years later, if I had run into my sister and her husband at family gatherings up to this point, we were cordial and friendly. But nothing like how we used to call or text each other. When I was getting married (4 years later) I invited my entire family and had planned for my sister’s little girl to be a flower girl for my own wedding. When my then fiancé tried to reach out to my sister to see if she would like our niece to be part of the wedding, she was ignored. No returned calls or texts.

My stepmother informed me and my fiancé that my stepsister is still upset about skipping her wedding years back. She suggested I apologize and make up. I was annoyed that she wasn’t adult enough to vent her own grievances directly to me, instead completely ignoring my now wife. I found it childish and disrespectful. Being stubborn as I am, I refused to apologize and 3 more years after my own wedding, my stepsister and I haven spoken.

AITA?


EDIT 1: I am content with the general consensus as TA. But there seems to be confusion as to why I’m upset at my sister. I’ll clarify…

I didn’t expect her to attend my wedding when I asked (which we didn’t have a formal ceremony anyway because of the COVID nonsense). Especially since I skipped hers for my own mental maintenance.

Not acknowledging communication is rude. My wife had nothing to with any of my decisions before this.",i was invited to attend my little stepsister’s wedding a few years back our families were blended at a young age so there’s a natural sense of closeness growing up together in our family at the time i was expecting to be out of town for military training when i received an invitation so i let her know well in advance that i wouldn’t be able to attend when the weekend of the wedding came i had forgotten about the date of the event because i wasn’t going anyway it was also a long weekend where i was afforded a day break from my training i decided last minute to purchase a plane ticket and fly across the country to visit my girlfriend at the time on the second day of my long weekend the day of my little stepsister’s wedding my father called me to chitchat about my training i had been doing i let him know it was fun and challenging but stressful still i also mentioned to him that i took advantage of the long weekend and flew back home he politely mentioned that it’s my little sister’s wedding today and that i had plenty of time to attend still looking at my watch i had two hours before it started it’s also a two hour drive even if i dropped everything i was doing and immediately left i’d be late and stressed about the whole ordeal i wanted to relax and clear my mind from the stress of training i had just finished working out i wasn’t ready for the day i hadn’t prepared any decent clothes for the wedding and simply put i just wasn’t willing to change my plans last minute for an event i wasn’t planning on attending anyway i told my dad i wasn’t coming somewhere along the conversation with my dad word got out i was back in the state my littlest stepsister called and asked me to please come i politely declined i didn’t give an excuse because i knew it wouldn’t matter to her so i didn’t show up to my stepsister’s wedding i enjoyed the rest of my weekend then flew back to my training and completed it successfully years later if i had run into my sister and her husband at family gatherings up to this point we were cordial and friendly but nothing like how we used to call or text each other when i was getting married years later i invited my entire family and had planned for my sister’s little girl to be a flower girl for my own wedding when my then fiancé tried to reach out to my sister to see if she would like our niece to be part of the wedding she was ignored no returned calls or texts my stepmother informed me and my fiancé that my stepsister is still upset about skipping her wedding years back she suggested i apologize and make up i was annoyed that she wasn’t adult enough to vent her own grievances directly to me instead completely ignoring my now wife i found it childish and disrespectful being stubborn as i am i refused to apologize and more years after my own wedding my stepsister and i haven spoken  edit i am content with the general consensus as ta but there seems to be confusion as to why i’m upset at my sister i’ll clarify… i didn’t expect her to attend my wedding when i asked which we didn’t have a formal ceremony anyway because of the covid nonsense especially since i skipped hers for my own mental maintenance i can live with reaping what i’ve sewed i did however expect my sister to respond to my nowwife’s invitation of her daughter as a flower girl even if she declined not acknowledging communication is rude my wife had nothing to with any of my decisions before this,654,YTA
1792,yt3u13,AITA for telling my daughter I don’t want her half sibling sleeping over my house?,telling my daughter i don’t want her half sibling sleeping over my house,"I (36) share a  daughter (6) with my ex-husband (38) We got divorced three years ago when he decided out of the blue marriage wasn’t for him, but I guess it was only marriage to me because he was married again less than a year later to the little girl who lived down the street from us (28f). (For background, I know he cheated. He claims he did not and hid it all very well but I know he did).  Now they’re expecting their first child and my daughter is obviously very excited to be a big sister. 

The other day she asked me who I was going to be to her little sister, and I told her I wasn’t anything to it. She seemed confused so I had to explain to her that even though me and her father had her together he decided that he wanted to have a family with someone else so I wasn’t involved with this kid. She asked if that means the kid won’t be coming to my house and I said nope, then she asked if the kid would be able to go to her grandparents (my parents) and I told her no again and she got pretty upset at that. 

So I guess when she went to her fathers she was still upset and she told them why and to comfort her I guess the new wife told her that when the baby got older they could have sleepovers here so she came home all excited for that. (She’s also told my daughter that we’d go on vacations together….etc). 

I don’t want this kid at my house, I don’t want it over for sleepovers or vacation or anything. I told my daughter that and she got upset.

1794,yt3n93,AITA for asking my sister to stop using her breastmilk pump at night and offering to buy her formula?,asking my sister to stop using her breastmilk pump at night and offering to buy her formula,"I [m30s] live with my wife [f30s] and our two kids [f7 and f4].

My sister Jean [f20s] is in a very tough situation. She got evicted from her apartment, and she has an 8 month old baby. The father was never in the picture but he does pay child support.

Jean asked me if she could stay with me and my family for free until she got back on her feet. I talked to my wife and we agreed to let Jean stay, and set up our spare bedroom.

There's just one problem. Jean breastfeeds her baby and uses a breastmilk pump. The breastmilk pump is very, very loud and Jean frequently uses it in the middle of the night, even though her baby sleeps through the night.

Jean has woken up me, my wife and my kids several times in the night with the breastmilk pump and I think she's being a bit inconsiderate. My wife is really annoyed by it and thinks Jean has no self-awareness.

I talked to Jean and explained that the pump is noisy and the walls in our home are very thin, I asked if she could use it during the day and not when everyone else is sleeping. Jean seemed shocked that I'd ask her that, and said that she's in a routine and that she read online that night time is the best time to pump.

I told Jean that I understand but my family and I really need to sleep, and I offered to buy her a tub of baby formula for in case her milk supply runs low.

This really set her off, she said that breastmilk is liquid gold and that she couldn't believe I'd offer her formula, and said that me and my family need to stay out of her business and wear earplugs.

I think Jean is overreacting and needs to compromise because she is living with other people. I told my wife about what happened and she thinks I should ask Jean to find somewhere else to live because if she won't compromise on this she won't compromise on other issues. But with Jean's strong reaction I'm wondering if I was the AH and there was a better way to deal with it.",i ms live with my wife fs and our two kids f and f my sister jean fs is in a very tough situation she got evicted from her apartment and she has an month old baby the father was never in the picture but he does pay child support jean asked me if she could stay with me and my family for free until she got back on her feet i talked to my wife and we agreed to let jean stay and set up our spare bedroom theres just one problem jean breastfeeds her baby and uses a breastmilk pump the breastmilk pump is very very loud and jean frequently uses it in the middle of the night even though her baby sleeps through the night jean has woken up me my wife and my kids several times in the night with the breastmilk pump and i think shes being a bit inconsiderate my wife is really annoyed by it and thinks jean has no selfawareness i talked to jean and explained that the pump is noisy and the walls in our home are very thin i asked if she could use it during the day and not when everyone else is sleeping jean seemed shocked that id ask her that and said that shes in a routine and that she read online that night time is the best time to pump i told jean that i understand but my family and i really need to sleep and i offered to buy her a tub of baby formula for in case her milk supply runs low this really set her off she said that breastmilk is liquid gold and that she couldnt believe id offer her formula and said that me and my family need to stay out of her business and wear earplugs i think jean is overreacting and needs to compromise because she is living with other people i told my wife about what happened and she thinks i should ask jean to find somewhere else to live because if she wont compromise on this she wont compromise on other issues but with jeans strong reaction im wondering if i was the ah and there was a better way to deal with it,377,YTA
1797,yt1zar,AITA for allowing my daughter to call my wife (her stepmom) the best mother ever,allowing my daughter to call my wife her stepmom the best mother ever,"I (31m have a 10yrs old daughter with a woman named Emily(31F). Emily and I never got along when our daughter was born, mainly because she always calls cps on me about child maintenance(support when we have shared custody). i was financially stable at 21 because i had won the loterry recently and invested  it in a successful business. On the other hand, Emily was from the USA and had to drop out of university for out baby which caused a lot of issues when raising our daughter. This is because she had a full time job to help raise her daughter meaning she was always busy. While I chose  to work at home on my buisness until my daughter was 4 (we both lived separately). Around this time i married another woman (katie) who I had twins with. Katie always loved my daughter as her own and never chose favourites between mine and hers. My daughter eventually began calling her mommy katie which infuriated Emily for no reason. Long story short it was recently my 10yrs old daughter birthday party, and when she blew out her candle she wished for a hug from her mom. She ran to katie. I was obvivously happy to see my daughter happy, though emily was in tears. She began shouting at both me and katie for spoiling our daughter to like us better. Then she began ranting on how horrible we are to treat her like this for 6yrs. I was about to kick her out before our daughter sreamed she hated Emily and that Katie was the best mother. This happened a 3 days ago and i haven't heard from her since. Her parents called me shouting for always treating their daughter like crap and nor finacially providing for her like a man. I told them to fuck off brfore I hung up. I don't think I did anything wron but i keep getting angry phone calls from her family members. katie says we didn't do anything wrong and it's her fault for being a horrible mother. My daughter is pretty much ok and is enjoying her presents. So AITA here or not.

Just to clear a few ponits that everyone is commenting. I always disipline my daughter when she needs its and i teach her responsibility all the time. so I'm not the just the ""fun"" dad i'm a father who rewards her child when they listen and does great in school. Second point is that blood doesn't make family love does. I hated nearly everyone blood related to me but i was force to act like i love them. Never gonna happen with my kids. I can't force my daughter to love someone. if anything I'm proud that my daughter was able to scream what she said. i never had that courage as a child. Also my number one responsibility is to do what is best in my daughter life not mine.  

Because you all wanted to here things that make emily a horrible mother here it is.
while my daughter is at  emily place she prefers to stay in her room most of the time but whenever emily has family over she forces my daughter to interact with them. If my daughter wants to stay in her room she should be allowed. that is her right. They have the aducity to make a few jokes about my daughter growing up in the ""posh"" area. My daughter hates these jokes but emily does nothing. My daughter usally refuses to eat with strangers but here is emily forcing her to do so never the less most food she makes is unhealthy. She also forces her to share her things ( that i dam bought her) with her cousins) especially her phone and tablet. Even some of her clothes. Emily keeps telling me she is teaching our daughter to share but my daughter hates to share just like i hated it too. Why should she  have to share her own stuff epecialy when emily didn't buy it for her. This is fucking disgusting. SO here is why i hate emily more than ever

Just to make this clear me and my daughter of course are two different people but i'm one of the few adults who know her the best. I understand she hates to share and she tells me she hates to share with her mother side of the family. I buy her everything when she stays at her mothers because i thought that would solve the issue of sharing her mothers stuff. but no these people think touching my daughter property is ok because we are ""family"". I told them to stop with what i call abuse and have made my daughter to put locks and passowrds on everything. Emily exuse was she wanted to help bond her with her family. I even bought my daughter a sectret walkie talkie for an emergency incase anything happens. I can't deal with this woman so i need full custody of my child. My daughter has hobies like horse ridding and swimming sometimes but because of emily she has missed a few lessons. Emily told me it was better to spend time with the ""family"". instead my daughter doing her fucking hobby. I don't know how you can defend this woman. My daughter still hasn't even gone through her first period and i already know that is going to start another fuss on who is going to teach her to be clean or whatever. 


IT'S NOt MY RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PAY FOR SOMEONE else child EDUCATION THAT WAS HER PARENTS JOB NOT MINE. MY JOB IS TO PAY FOR MY CHILDREN EDUCATION WHICH I PAY BY MYSELF BY THE WAY. I   SEND all  MY KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL and i'm the only one paying here.
 I DIDNT HELP HER FINACIALLY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TOO. I DON'T CARE If SHE IS THE  MOTHER OF MY CHILD I  DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TP PAY FOR ""HER NEEDs"" i only pay for my child needs


I read a comment saying is the gender was reversed you would all be cheering for me and I agree. You mostly hate me for being a man with money BUT if i was a women it would be outrageous for a man to ask for money on 50/50 custody. My daughter is upstairs doing her homework now before she can go have fun. We plan on having dinner like a family later. Christmans is coming and i can' wait to see my daughter smile when she opens her gifts. Thank you for all the people who saw my side of the post. I may post an update the next time i talk to emily but i don't know or csre right now. I'm about to help my daughter with her homework if she needs it.

JUST TO MAKE THIS CLEAR SHE COULD HAVE HAD AN ABORTION i even offered to help pay but she refused. she wanted to be a mother and now shie is a mother of a 10yrs old girl. i never forced her to be pregnant.

To make this clear i always wanted to be a father since i was a litte kid but i was never going to force someone to carry my child so that is why i offered to pay for an abortion if she wanted one. I was not mad that she chose to keep it ; i was really exited actually. I also paid for the whole medical bill and all hospital expenses. incuding all the baby clothes and baby food for nearly a whole dam year. What i didn't pay for was her need such as her : clothes, food, phone, fun expenses, and so on. She wanted to be treated like a queen and i refused. I have always been paying for my child school trips, medical bills, holidays, toys, bikes, and what ever.

Horse riding is for my daughter sake not mine. I began giving her lseson when she was 5 but i wanted to stop a few years later after she gotten hurt. But she began to cry and scream but i stopped anyway. then my daughter began to get worse kind of and the teachers notice. horse ridding helps her emtionally i think i don't know. So i let her carry one as long she promised she would behave and be safe. So horse ridding is kind of a must for her. Emily knows this and is disturning her lessons on purpose.

1799,yt750d,AITA for telling my wife that she can stay home this Thanksgiving?,telling my wife that she can stay home this thanksgiving,"

My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.


As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.

She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the ""perfect compromise"".


Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision.

1809,yt8wo0,AITA for assuming “don’t worry about it” means “you don’t have to pay for that” at a bar?,assuming “don’t worry about it” means “you don’t have to pay for that” at a bar,"Last weekend I went to a casino for one of my old friend’s birthday. It’s a weekend thing, we stay Friday night through Sunday morning 

So Saturday night, our last night at the casino, I’m down $200 because my friends don’t let me stop gambling until they’re ready to stop gambling. I just want to lock my wallet in a safe at this point and leave the casino but we’ve got this dinner at a fancy restaurant booked and then reservations at a nightclub VIP thing after. I just got the side salad and a water at dinner because I can’t afford any of this. Then we go to the night club and I just get water again. My friend says “why are you getting water here?” I say I’m just gonna stay on the cheap for the rest of the night because money is tight now. He says “hey don’t worry about it”. I say “really?” And he says again “Yeah, don’t worry about it.”

I assume this phrase, when said in this context, means “I’m buying your next drink”. So I order my favorite cocktail, tell the bartender to put it on my friend’s tab, and go back to the dance floor. When the end of the night came and we were closing out our tabs, my one drink was on my friend’s tab. He told the bartender there was a mistake because he didn’t order that. I reminded him that he said he was buying it for me. He said “I never said that. I just told you not to worry about it. Like, we’re on vacation. Life is short. Don’t worry about stuff like that.”

At this point I’m a little pissed because I would normally never buy that drink at that price given the current situation I’m in. The only reason I didn’t get water or soda was because I thought my friend was offering to paying for it. We got into a small argument there in the bar, but I dropped it because it was his birthday. Days later he’s still joking about it in the group chat like “I can’t believe you thought I was buying your drink” and I keep telling him it’s a dick move to say what he said without realizing that most people mean that phrase to mean they’re paying for it. My friend group is weirdly split, people who knew about it that night seem to side with me but people who found out later on are siding with my friend and saying I shouldn’t be putting drinks on other people’s tabs unless I’m 100% they’re OK with that. AITA?

Edit: Getting a lot of questions about the “my friends don’t let me stop gambling until they’re ready to stop gambling” kind so I thought I’d add on to that part. We were there from Friday night until Sunday morning and the plan was to play blackjack and games like that most of the time we were there. Within a couple hours of showing up, I’m UP about $100 from when I walked in and I was content with that because it would’ve paid for my split of the hotel room. My friends then all started giving me shit for cashing out so early. The comment that got me was from a different friend was “Why would you even come on a casino weekend if you’re going to stop playing on the first night? What are you even going to do for the next two days?” and everyone seemed to agree with that statement so I went and got more chips to avoid bringing people down at what is supposed to be a celebration",last weekend i went to a casino for one of my old friend’s birthday it’s a weekend thing we stay friday night through sunday morning so saturday night our last night at the casino i’m down because my friends don’t let me stop gambling until they’re ready to stop gambling i just want to lock my wallet in a safe at this point and leave the casino but we’ve got this dinner at a fancy restaurant booked and then reservations at a nightclub vip thing after i just got the side salad and a water at dinner because i can’t afford any of this then we go to the night club and i just get water again my friend says “why are you getting water here” i say i’m just gonna stay on the cheap for the rest of the night because money is tight now he says “hey don’t worry about it” i say “really” and he says again “yeah don’t worry about it” i assume this phrase when said in this context means “i’m buying your next drink” so i order my favorite cocktail tell the bartender to put it on my friend’s tab and go back to the dance floor when the end of the night came and we were closing out our tabs my one drink was on my friend’s tab he told the bartender there was a mistake because he didn’t order that i reminded him that he said he was buying it for me he said “i never said that i just told you not to worry about it like we’re on vacation life is short don’t worry about stuff like that” at this point i’m a little pissed because i would normally never buy that drink at that price given the current situation i’m in the only reason i didn’t get water or soda was because i thought my friend was offering to paying for it we got into a small argument there in the bar but i dropped it because it was his birthday days later he’s still joking about it in the group chat like “i can’t believe you thought i was buying your drink” and i keep telling him it’s a dick move to say what he said without realizing that most people mean that phrase to mean they’re paying for it my friend group is weirdly split people who knew about it that night seem to side with me but people who found out later on are siding with my friend and saying i shouldn’t be putting drinks on other people’s tabs unless i’m they’re ok with that  edit getting a lot of questions about the “my friends don’t let me stop gambling until they’re ready to stop gambling” kind so i thought i’d add on to that part we were there from friday night until sunday morning and the plan was to play blackjack and games like that most of the time we were there within a couple hours of showing up i’m up about from when i walked in and i was content with that because it would’ve paid for my split of the hotel room my friends then all started giving me shit for cashing out so early the comment that got me was from a different friend was “why would you even come on a casino weekend if you’re going to stop playing on the first night what are you even going to do for the next two days” and everyone seemed to agree with that statement so i went and got more chips to avoid bringing people down at what is supposed to be a celebration,613,ESH
1810,yt9zvh,AITA for backing my fiancee in not inviting my dad's affair partner to the wedding even though this situation is embarrassing my mom?,backing my fiancee in not inviting my dads affair partner to the wedding even though this situation is embarrassing my mom,"My fiancee hates cheaters. I'd assume most people do, but she really hates them as her previous partner cheated on her and it was very traumatic. They had just moved in together and she was fantasizing about the wedding and having kids, and he blew that all up. She has zero sympathy for cheaters. Her dad also cheated a few times and MIL keeps taking him back but it has clearly hurt her self esteem.

Anyway my dad cheated on my mom about two years ago. it was this big dramatic affair, him acting like an idiot claiming he'd never be in love before, and then leaving my mom. He is seriously a different person now, affectionate, he seems to have emotions, it is weird. 

My mom claims she doesn't care. i mean I know on some level he must have hurt her ego, but I don't think she was that hurt or traumatized, certainly nothing close to what my fiancee experienced with her ex. My mom and dad can be in the same room, act civil, and neither seems uncomfortable.

Still my fiancee has a very low opinion of my father and hates the other woman. Note this is strictly about the cheating. She is not at all protective of my mom as they don't even get along. She decided she doesn't want my dad's new wife at the wedding. I agreed as her comfort is my priority.

We told my dad and he was furious and said he will not be coming. When my mom found out she freaked and said everyone is going to think this came from her and she asked for it. She said we had no right to do that and we made her look like some pathetic scorned ex. I tried to reason with her but she was pissed. She accused my fiancee of being over dramatic and said we had no right to have any opinion on her marriage ending.

My fiancee got pretty pissed and told her it wasn't her wedding. I did feel bad but said my fiancee's feelings matter much more and she doesn't want this woman at the wedding. My mom stormed off and I feel bad.

1818,yt6w6o,AITA for disinviting my cousin to my wedding?,disinviting my cousin to my wedding,"I (25m) am getting married on December 31st of this year. Invitations have long been sent out. My cousin (41f) RSVP'd that she would be there with her three children (20m, 18f, 16m) and her boyfriend (47m).

I grew up around my cousin (she was a teenager when I was born so she was my number one babysitter growing up). There was a time when I was younger that we were close, but as I grew and moved away to college, that relationship has faded and we really only ever see each other during holidays now. 

I have never met her boyfriend. They met online. He lives in Las Vegas and she lives in Tallahassee with her boys (her daughter is attending college in South Florida). I know they have been together for more than a year But because we have never met him, my fiance and I decided we did not want him at our wedding.

Yesterday I called my cousin to speak with her about our concerns. As you may imagine, the phone call did not go well. She said he had already bought his plane ticket and she had already bought her dress. She was bawling by the end of it and asked if there was anything she could do that would change my mind. I stood fast.

Because we decided to get married on New Year's Eve, this is quite possibly the last time all three of her children will be together for this particular holiday. It's not that I don't want my cousin to be at my wedding, I just don't want her to bring her online boyfriend. She says they are spending the rest of their lives together and that he is her other half, But why would I want to have a complete stranger at my wedding?

For background my parents got divorced when I was 5. The divorce happened after my dad fell in love with his current wife/my stepmom Alice. They claim they didn't cheat but waited to be separated before anything physical happened. I dont know or need to know whether thats true at this point. My dad and Alice got married and were living together by the time I was 7. They had my two siblings within the next 4 years. My parents had split custody and Alice was 100% a mother figure to me. We are very close, she's been there for me for every tough moment of my life. She also helped pay for my college and grad school which Im extremely appreciative of. My mom is a good mom but we've never been as close as I am with my dad and Alice. Our personalities are just very different.

We're planning the first dances right now and have my first dance with my fiancee and she has hers picked out with her dad. Her parents are still married so there's no drama there. Being so close to Alice, I really dont feel right excluding her and only doing a dance with my mom, so I asked her if she'd be comfortable doing one with me as well. She was overjoyed and cried with emotion. Im really excited for it. But once my mom found out she flipped out. Said Im replacing her like my dad replaced her. I told her its not a replacement but she's been so supportive of me my entire life and I consider her a true ""bonus mother"" so I dont want to exclude her. She doesnt want to accept that.

I don’t like Nora at all. She’s lazy, nosy, a know it all, and lacks all social skills. Once Amy and I were debating about the best way to sear a steak when Nora injected herself into our conversation and tried to explain to us the exact method and type of pan to use. I didn’t call her out but I silently asked myself what the hell does she know about cooking steak, she’s a vegan. Another time Nora asked me about my 401k account and how much I have in it. Again, I was silently thinking to myself about how rude she was for asking about how much money I have in there (not much btw). No matter what you’re talking about, she’ll have something to say. Another time she was talking about dinosaurs for a good hour at dinner. We all just sat there (long after we were done eating) to be polite but no one talked because no one cared about dinosaurs and she never paused to take a breath to give anyone a chance to change the topic. Worst of all, she’s a stay at home wife.

Not a stay at home mom, they have no kids, a stay at home wife. There’s nothing wrong with her physically to prevent her from working, she claimed she has anxiety that prevents her from working. I’m not a doctor but I don’t see any anxiety when she’s shopping at Target or out at the beach during our family outings. Normally I wouldn’t concern myself with Sam’s family but it’s affecting me.

I don’t see anything wrong with a one income family as long as that income can support that family. In Sam’s case, his income can’t support him and his wife. I’ve had to loan him money at least a dozen times since he married Nora. They’re always short on the rent or don’t have money for the utility bills or whatever. Last week Sam asked to borrow $50 for lunch for the week because he’s short again. I love my kid brother but I had enough. I told him no and that he would have lunch money if his lazy wife works. We argued because he took offense at me calling her lazy. He later told Amy about our argument and she yelled at me for willing to let him go hungry. She loaned him the money. I told her he needs to go hungry to see that his wife is a leech.

1833,yt9dsl,AITA for asking my bridesmaid to cut her hair for my wedding?,asking my bridesmaid to cut her hair for my wedding,"I (mid 20's F) am getting married. My fiancé (late 20's M) and I are paying for everything for our bridal party as we want their support without anyone getting in debt for us as we know not all our friends are in as good a financial position as we are. However, I'm having a problem with how much it's going to cost to do the hair of one of my bridesmaids.

The bridesmaid (Adie, early 20's F) has extremely long, thick hair, past her knees. I don't think she has ever cut her hair. Adie is the best man’s (late 20's M) wife who also has extremely long hair. Due to the length of her hair, the hairdresser's that I am using has advised that to do Adie's hair, it's going to cost double due to the current length as they will need to dedicate just one person to do Adie's hair as it will take much longer to do her hair. Another stylist will be able to do the hair of the other 3 bridesmaids in the same amount of time. We had a trial and it took 50 minutes to do Adie's hair compared to the 20 minutes each for the others. It didn't look as nice as the others due to how much hair was braided up. I don't want to have to pay for additional person because Adie's hair is ridiculously long. Adie's husband had already said he will cut his hair so that he looked neat but won’t say when its getting cut. I asked Adie to also cut her hair to at least her waist so that it's of similar length to my other bridesmaids.

Adie was upset when I asked her to cut her hair as she got upset and told me that I was being insensitive asking her to cut her hair as I know that she doesn't cut her hair for cultural reasons. I honestly thought this was a reasonable request. It's my wedding, surely, she wants to make me happy. Adie said it was one step too far for her as I had already asked her to not use her rosemary hair oil as I didn't want her to smell like a woody scented hippie at the wedding - the stuff stinks, but she swears by it for her hair. Adie suggested that she did her own hair, but I said no as I want my bridesmaids to all look the same and she'd look different if she did her own hair. I asked if she would pay the £200 that I'm being charged extra for her hair, and she's refused saying they can't afford it. Adie has said that I'm being a bridezilla, but I disagree. I don't think I'm being unreasonably. Adie has since spoken with her husband, and he's now told my fiancé that he won't be cutting his hair either and will be instead putting it back nicely. He wasn't happy that I was 'pushing' Adie to cutting her hair. Fiancé isn't bothered because he just wants his friend next to him, but I'm upset that they're not willing to do this one thing.

I thought I would come to reddit to ask if I am being the asshole in this situation, just for an outsider opinion. Am I being an asshole? I don't think I am because it's not unreasonable to ask someone to do something for my wedding, but Adie thinks I am as she doesn't cut her hair.

Edit: Ok, I realise I'm the asshole. I'm going to call Adie later and apologise for asking her to cut hair but ask her if she would prefer to just be a guest as I would like to have my bridesmaids all look the same.

Edit 2: Ok, I get it. I'm the asshole and that my apology plan doesn't sound great. I'm going to talk with Adie and revisit the idea of her doing her own hair and maybe look for another style that would work better for all the different hair lengths and types my bridesmaids have. While I would like my bridesmaids to all look the same, I know it wasn't right to ask her to cut her hair or kick her out of the wedding. I asked her to be a bridesmaid as her husband is the best man - we aren't very close, but they are a package deal and I know he wouldn't want to walk down the aisle with anyone else. I respect that these are his boundaries, and I should have respected that with Adie. I have asked her not to use the oil just due to the fact she can be heavy handed with it and one of my bridesmaids is really sensitive to smells and it can be strong. When I asked her not to wear it, she was ok with it as she understood and didn't want to cause the other bridesmaid a migraine.

Edit 3: I have spoken with Adie; I have apologised for asking her to cut her hair. I have offered to take her and her husband out for dinner next week as a way to apologise for my lack of judgement. I have asked Adie if she was still open to doing her own hair, if not I would pay the extra money. Adie said she would prefer to do her own hair, and we have agreed to do some hair trials next weekend to see if we can find a style that suits her. Adie has advised that her husband is still upset that I asked her to cut her hair as he felt as if I was being pushy, but she said he will calm down in time. Adie and I are also going for lunch in the week so we can get to know each other better, her husband adores her as she's a lovely person and I should get to know her as they are a big part of my fiancé's life.

My mom has always worked in creative fields including as a professional writer, so I would not expect this from her. 

Recently we both (meaning my mom and her husband, and my wife and I) went to visit my grandfather for his birthday. We were all staying at his house. My wife got up to make some breakfast and came back in tears. She said she overheard my mom and her husband making fun of her and they have her fanfiction profile up, and were reading her work. She said she didn't confront them as she was too embarrassed, and they didn't see her as they were both laying in the hammock thing outside and neither were facing her.

I went out and they were both leaned over my mom's phone giggling. I demanded to know what they were laughing at and my mom said nothing and told me to stop being weird. I told her I knew and she better not lie to me. She admitted she had been reading my wife's fanfiction but said it wasn't a big deal. I asked why they were laughing then. He said ""because it is fanfiction"" and my mom said because it was really poorly written and creepy.

I was like you literally are a published author, and my mom said that is totally different as she is coming up with her own ideas and not stealing someone elses. She said the stuff was just objectively funny and after reading it she was worried about our marriage. 

I blew up and said she should worry about her own marriage as her husband married a bitch. I said her whole career was a joke and she thinks she is smart, but she is dumb enough to isolate the woman her son loves. My mom giggled and said I was literally crazy and why can't we just admit fanfiction is lame and weird.

My poor wife pretty much hid all day and shed some tears over it. I ended up getting my hands on a copy of one of her books as my grandpa's wife had it in her book shelf. I pulled it out at dinner in front of a couple other people and handed it to her husband and said that maybe he should worry about their marriage because apparently my mom wants to fuck her stepbrother because she wrote some erotica about it.

We used to just rotate, but there was a huge debate over Christmas a few years ago and now she refuses to spend it with my mom.

Basically my mom never bought presents for our kids and my wife felt she was doing that to make a statement. my mom said she just thought gifts should be only for nuclear family and she was only interested in buying for her husband. she said we were being entitled. 

Now I agree she doesn't actually owe our kids gifts, but it was my wife's hill to die on. I even offered to buy gifts and give them to my mom to give to the kids, but she said I was just feeding into my wife's entitlement, so she lost Christmas.

The issue is my mom doesn't like thanksgiving. she complains every year that it is a pointless holiday and the food sucks. This year she wants to go to my dad's house so she doesn't have to cook food she doesn't like. I told her she can do what she wants, but that means no holidays with me and implied she was selfish.

My mom snapped at me that we should just come for Christmas and she is sick of being treated ""like a slave"" by having to cook Thanksgiving dinner, and she would rather let my dad's wife cook it. I blew up and said I really don't care if she is sad. I was sad when my own mom didn't care enough to give my kids the free gifts I would provide, and basically cry me a river. Nothing is going to change and if she goes to my dad's, yeah I'm going to judge her.

1849,ytmc99,AITA for telling my neighbour i will expect them to pick up my dogs mess?,telling my neighbour i will expect them to pick up my dogs mess,"I (25f) have just moved into a 2 bedroom house with my toddler and 2 dogs (doberman cross collie, Bruce and english bulldog, Cali) Im also 33 weeks pregnant. Now i am a mindful dog owner, i know alot of people dont tolerate dogs barking so i try to keep my dogs noise to a minimum. Obviously this does not workout all the time and Bruce does go on a barking spree (as im sure most dogs do on some days)

I let my dogs out on a 2:1 ratio. In the house for 2 hours and having a run in the garden for 1 (this is obviously depending on weather) this ratio works out for most the day. They first go out a 8am to do their business, have a run and come back in for 9am once my daughter has had breakfast. If im due to leave the house early then i leave them out for an extra half hour. Bruce loves to run after the birds in our garden and sometimes has a bark at them, his barking never goes on for more than 10 minutes and if it ever does i will bring him inside a little earlier. The last time they go out  an hour is at 7 when i go to bath my toddler and do bedtime routine. They are normally in by 8 at the latest and then between half 10-11 for their last toilet time.

Yesterday i had a knock on my door from a neighbour saying i was letting my dogs out too early and he demanded i keep them in until atleast 11am as when bruce barks it wakes him up (cali doesnt bark and when she does it sounds more like shes coughing). I told him that theres no way i could keep them in the house for 12 hours plus as its cruel and they need to be able to go to the bathroom. He then said its not his problem and i need to figure it out. So i politely said “ok, i can keep them in until 11 but what time should i expect you over to clean up the mess they make in the meantime?” 
He looks at me confused and i said “well if you are demanding i keep my dogs in then you must be willing to clean the mess they make when they need the toilet” he then started screaming about how i have no respct for people on the street and how he’s going to complain to the council about it.

I dont think ive done anything wrong as he shouldnt expect me to deal with my dogs mess in my house and around my toddler because he doesnt want them running around my garden before 11am but some of my friends are agreeing with him and telling me to keep them in…So AITA?


Edit to add a few things:
1. I do walk my dogs! I dont know where this assumption has come from but at 8am i am looking after my toddler. Also due to pregnancy issues ive had to look at getting a dog walker as they are getting too strong for me to walk being heavily pregnant.

2. Bruce doesnt bark constantly for 10 mins every 2 hours. He will give a few barks every couple of minutes for no more than 10 mins as it bugs me after about 5mins of hearing it. 

3. I would like to add that nearly every house on the street has dogs, during the day its like barking galore so the fact that bruce barks for maybe a total of 30 mins spread over 12 hours of the day doesnt seem excessive to me but he has a problem with my dog barking. None of the others (hes not even the loudest dog barking on the street, or the most annoying)

1857,ytp40i,AITA for truthfully telling my dad why I don’t want to go hiking with him anymore?,truthfully telling my dad why i don’t want to go hiking with him anymore,"My dad (40 something M) and I (15M) are both very athletic but he damaged his right knee 10 months ago in an accident. Before that we used to go hiking almost every weekend and do other sports like skiing/snowboarding together. He’s a lot slower because of his injury and when we hike I have to walk at a much slower pace and often wait for him to catch up with me. It’s also an hour drive to go to the trails, so I’d rather go only if the hike is at least 3+ hours and a workout.

My dad asked me to go hiking with him this morning again and I said no. He kept pressing me about why I don’t want to, how come I used to love the trails we used to hike in but now don’t seem interested. I was annoyed that he was acting like the problem was with me, like that I’ve fallen out of touch with nature or something. It rubbed me the wrong way. 

I decided to be honest with him and tell him the truth. I was blunt and said he’s so slow it’s not fun at all for me to go hiking with him and that it’s a waste of time because most of it is waiting around for him to catch up. I also don’t have much time anymore because I’m studying a lot and barely see my friends so I’d rather spend my time with my friends. This is the part where I may be in AH territory because I conveyed that I still do go hiking and spend time in the outdoors with my stepdad and mom so it’s not like I’m suddenly a nature-hater.

My dad just got really sad and left the room and then I felt bad but also glad I said it because I wanted to be straightforward about how I felt. My stepmom came into my room this afternoon and said my dad is really hurt by what I said to him and that I shouldn’t have said it because it’s not like he had control over his knee injury. My stepmom said he’s still struggling a lot emotionally with his knee injury as it is most likely permanent and it’s something he’s really sensitive about. She said I should apologize and tell my dad I didn’t mean any of what I said. I said no, I was just being honest and deserve to voice my thoughts.

1862,ytmwyh,AITA for not wanting to do funerals any more and not going to my late FIL's funeral? She's going to get mad at me.,not wanting to do funerals any more and not going to my late fils funeral shes going to get mad at me,"My MIL is very traditional. I don't mean that in the political sense, though I know she's a Republican but I mean in the sense that everything has to be done in the traditional way. Hallmark cards have to be given, not handwritten notes at birthdays. Christmas presents have to be wrapped with Christmas wrapping, not birthday wrapping or plain paper wrapping. 

My FIL just died in a tragic accident. 

I don't want to go to the funeral. I still haven't told her yet but I will likely say something about unable to get time off from work.

I avoided traditional burial/open casket funerals until I was nearly 40 years old when my (now 42 F) wife's (now 39 F) grandfather died. I had gone to funerals before then, like for my grandfather and uncle but they were both cremated so there was no casket. 

When my wife's grandfather died a few years ago right before COVID, I went and I'm not the better for it. It really creeped me out, seeing him dead in there. It's not like I liked my grandfather or uncle's funerals, but not seeing their dead bodies helped a lot. This on the other hand... I can't get my wife's grandfather's dead body out of my head.  The last thing I want to do is see my FIL's dead body. I was much closer to him. He was a cool guy and I'm going to miss him at Thanksgiving and Christmas and well all the time.

The problem is my MIL. She's going to be mad if I don't attend. No matter what the excuse is. Whether I tell her the truth I don't want my last memory of my FIL to be his body or whether I say I really can't get off work or even ""I just don't do funerals"". 

And because I expect someone might say ""you don't have to look"" this does nothing to protect against an accidental glance. Not to mention just seeing the side of his head/face in the coffin. I saw my wife's late grandfather's head quite easily from the seats and felt really uncomfortable there was a dead body in the room.

My wife feels the same as me, but she's going to go to not earn the wrath of her mom. She said she's not going to go up to the coffin though. The ""funny"" (probably not the right word) thing is, my MIL bought her plot next to my FIL for when she goes too, but I suspect my wife and her two brothers will likely just have her cremated and may not even have a traditional ceremony at all in a church or funeral home or what have you.",my mil is very traditional i dont mean that in the political sense though i know shes a republican but i mean in the sense that everything has to be done in the traditional way hallmark cards have to be given not handwritten notes at birthdays christmas presents have to be wrapped with christmas wrapping not birthday wrapping or plain paper wrapping my fil just died in a tragic accident i dont want to go to the funeral i still havent told her yet but i will likely say something about unable to get time off from work i avoided traditional burialopen casket funerals until i was nearly years old when my now f wifes now f grandfather died i had gone to funerals before then like for my grandfather and uncle but they were both cremated so there was no casket when my wifes grandfather died a few years ago right before covid i went and im not the better for it it really creeped me out seeing him dead in there its not like i liked my grandfather or uncles funerals but not seeing their dead bodies helped a lot this on the other hand i cant get my wifes grandfathers dead body out of my head the last thing i want to do is see my fils dead body i was much closer to him he was a cool guy and im going to miss him at thanksgiving and christmas and well all the time the problem is my mil shes going to be mad if i dont attend no matter what the excuse is whether i tell her the truth i dont want my last memory of my fil to be his body or whether i say i really cant get off work or even i just dont do funerals and because i expect someone might say you dont have to look this does nothing to protect against an accidental glance not to mention just seeing the side of his headface in the coffin i saw my wifes late grandfathers head quite easily from the seats and felt really uncomfortable there was a dead body in the room my wife feels the same as me but shes going to go to not earn the wrath of her mom she said shes not going to go up to the coffin though the funny probably not the right word thing is my mil bought her plot next to my fil for when she goes too but i suspect my wife and her two brothers will likely just have her cremated and may not even have a traditional ceremony at all in a church or funeral home or what have you,452,YTA

Part of my routine is a 15-20 minute shower of a morning and then a 5-10 shower of a night.

Me and my wife haven’t had much time to spend together, but I’m working towards a promotion and we spend all our free time with our baby, so she’s come up with the idea that we should share showers.

Problem being I take my showers as hot as they can go, it’s not hot enough until my skin turns red and my skins still warm from the shower like an hour later…(exaggerating, but yes hot as possible)

My wife likes colder showers, I can’t tolerate colder showers - it honestly stresses me out.

Anyway she’s insisting that I compromise, started “cutely” turning the shower down, but then I started locking the door and now she’s genuinely upset that I won’t compromise and spend my morning with her when it’s the only time we get

She says it’s our relaxing time, that it’s a slight compromise so we can spend time together and I’m refusing to budge despite her wanting to relax with me before staying home all alone with the baby (she works from home, once I get home from work though I take over baby care)

I told her no, she cited the fact that I only like hot showers because as a child I was bathed in scalding water, she knows my childhood is a topic I don’t like, so now we’re both upset with each other.

1871,ytdmtz,AITA for photo-shopping my brother-in-law out of a picture?,photoshopping my brotherinlaw out of a picture,"My whole family (my parents and all my siblings with their spouses and kids) recently took trip to Greece together. We don't all get together too often, so it was a nice occasion for all of us.

On the second to last day there, my parents and I got up early to have breakfast outside, and my brother-in-law was awake too so he ate with us. We were staying at a country inn, so it was pretty rustic, and halfway through breakfast a herd of goats came wandering out of a nearby olive grove and surrounded us at our table. The owner of the inn took a picture of us, smiling and laughing as we tried to keep the goats away from our food.

The lighting in the picture is perfect, and it's just full of so much dynamic movement and joy. It's my favorite picture from the trip, except for one thing-- my brother-in-law looks BAD. I'm not trying to judge him for looking bad-- he had stayed up late with a couple of my siblings the night before drinking heavily. He hadn't showered yet, so his hair was a mess, and he was unshaven. To top it off, he had what looks like some jelly on his nose.

I decided to crop him out of the picture (it was pretty easy to do, as the backdrop behind him was just the blue sky.) I didn't feel bad doing it, in fact I felt like I was doing him a favor. If I looked that bad in a picture, I would definitely want to be photo-shopped out of it if possible.

Anyway, my sister told me that he saw the picture on Facebook and got pissed. Apparently that was his favorite memory from the trip, and now he feels like my parents and I didn't want him there. I sent her the original picture as a way of explanation, but she says that's not the point.

Now he's threatening to skip Thanksgiving.

1885,ytwbwk,AITA for telling my boyfriend he should not turn on the heating without my permission?,telling my boyfriend he should not turn on the heating without my permission,"Hi everyone,

Me (M26) and my boyfriend (M25) have been together for over a year now. Things are going pretty well and we are getting along very nicely. Something happened though yesterday and I am not sure if I handled it correctly.

Basically, my boyfriend asked if he could stay with me for a week, because his roommate has covid and he is trying to not catch it. Because I had it recently already, I agreed. However, when I went to the gym yesterday morning, I noticed that when I got back he turned the heating on! I couldn't help but got annoyed that he would just do such a thing without asking me first. I mean, it's not that I can not afford the energy bill, it is just that he is turning on something that costs me (another person) money.

I get that my boyfriend gets cold quite quickly, but that doesn't mean he can just do whatever he wants and turn on the heating. I don't want him to pay for it or something, I just think it's polite to ask the home owner for permission before turning on the heating. If I were in his position, I would just grab a blanket until my boyfriend got home so I could ask if I can use his heating. Especially when gas prices are so high!

After I told this all to my boyfriend, he seemed to get annoyed and replied with ""if you're so concerned about the costs, I can help with your energy bill"". He just totally misses the point, I don't care about the money... Since then we haven't been talking a lot and he seems to be in his own bubble. I don't know what to do?

1890,ytu1pj,AITA for calling out my mother after a passive agressive FB post?,calling out my mother after a passive agressive fb post,"So my mom posted this article about ""things we did in the 60s that would horrify people today"", and went on to say that she felt sorry for her granddaughters (my children) because there were so many things she did that they won't get to experience.
My wife is the one who saw the post, and when I read it I immediately texted my mother asking ""what things did you do that MY daughters won't get to do? Ride in a car without a seat belt? Be outside on their own until nightfall? They're 5 and 2, not 13"".
She also had gone on to say that ""back in my day we didn't hear about all these allergies, they didn't exist, and visits to the doctor were very rare"". Again, in the fucking sixties! Jesus christ, people still believed cocaine was medicinal.
I also brought up the fact that she once lost me for hours as a child, she was attacked by a dog when she was a child because she was unsupervised. But yet she sits there and judges my parenting for actually wanting to be around my kids?
She started to say that her post wasn't about me or my wife. That she believed we were excellent parents and blah blah blah (why even bring up MY kids in the first place then?) But then she got super angry for the things I said about her mistakes as a parent. Which I wasn't attacking her, but I was highlighting that her standards of safety back then were NOT the right mindset to have.
We have an extremely volatile relationship. I have severe CPTSD, and I've tried to maintain a relationship with her solely for my daughters' sake. She steps over every single boundary we set. She disrespects my wife and me as parents constantly, and frankly we distrust her around the kids by herself. A few years ago we let her watch our first daughter while we went to work, only to find that she took her to a town 30 mins away, then to her house, and then back to my home WITHOUT TELLING US, until we came home. That was the last time we had her watch my daughter. Ever since, she's been extremely jealous that my MIL watches the girls ONCE a week while my wife and I work the weekend.

So after this whole debacle, she made the decision to cut us off completely. Blocked our numbers, and said she will never speak to us again.
Frankly I'm ok with it, but I'm so hurt that she would make such a decision without even considering how it would affect the kids. Should I not have said anything to her about her damn post? AITA?",so my mom posted this article about things we did in the s that would horrify people today and went on to say that she felt sorry for her granddaughters my children because there were so many things she did that they wont get to experience my wife is the one who saw the post and when i read it i immediately texted my mother asking what things did you do that my daughters wont get to do ride in a car without a seat belt be outside on their own until nightfall theyre and not she also had gone on to say that back in my day we didnt hear about all these allergies they didnt exist and visits to the doctor were very rare again in the fucking sixties jesus christ people still believed cocaine was medicinal i also brought up the fact that she once lost me for hours as a child she was attacked by a dog when she was a child because she was unsupervised but yet she sits there and judges my parenting for actually wanting to be around my kids she started to say that her post wasnt about me or my wife that she believed we were excellent parents and blah blah blah why even bring up my kids in the first place then but then she got super angry for the things i said about her mistakes as a parent which i wasnt attacking her but i was highlighting that her standards of safety back then were not the right mindset to have we have an extremely volatile relationship i have severe cptsd and ive tried to maintain a relationship with her solely for my daughters sake she steps over every single boundary we set she disrespects my wife and me as parents constantly and frankly we distrust her around the kids by herself a few years ago we let her watch our first daughter while we went to work only to find that she took her to a town mins away then to her house and then back to my home without telling us until we came home that was the last time we had her watch my daughter ever since shes been extremely jealous that my mil watches the girls once a week while my wife and i work the weekend so after this whole debacle she made the decision to cut us off completely blocked our numbers and said she will never speak to us again frankly im ok with it but im so hurt that she would make such a decision without even considering how it would affect the kids should i not have said anything to her about her damn post,456,YTA
1900,yu5o55,AITA for telling my soon to be SIL she's an AH for not respecting my brother's wishes for their wedding?,telling my soon to be sil shes an ah for not respecting my brothers wishes for their wedding,"(fake names)

My brother Jace is getting married in a month to his fiancée Mary and there have been a lot of instances where my brother is displeased with the bride to be's choices.

One instance is how he doesn't like the style of wedding dresses she likes. He hasn't seen her actual wedding dress (I have) but he knows the general direction of what she'd go for. I've seen the dress and honestly I'm certain my brother will despise it.

Secondly, she's died her hair into a dirty blonde shade and changed her natural hair color which was chocolate brown. My brother adores natural hair and everything natural to be honest so the drastic change she made just a while before the wedding, he's not a fan of it.

Thirdly it's the thing that broke the camel's back for me and lead me to speak up about her behavior. She's doing a full glam makeup for the wedding which my brother hates. He prefers a light, natural makeup. The whole thing bothers me because while I understand its her wedding, I think she fails to realise its also my brother's wedding and she doesn't respect any of his opinions regarding this. She just does whatever she pleases and expects my brother to just suck it up as if his opinion on how this wedding will unroll and his opinion on certain choices doesn't matter.

So couple days ago I addressed this to her and I made sure my brother knows he's on the right and that I'm on his side. So I addressed it while both of them were present and I said that Mary is being really self centered and kind of an AH for not taking into account my brother's opinions and I reminded her how it's also his wedding not just hers.

She went into full defense mode and said that she values his opinion on general stuff like the decorations or what kind of song they'll dance to but she won't let my brother dictate her appearance and that I should take my unsolicited advice and shove it. My brother barely reacted and when I looked at him to step in her said ""you reap what you sow"" which pretty much means I brought this on myself.

I was just trying to do a nice thing and stick up for my brother just for him to throw me under the bus. Anyone I've told this to has said I acted like an AH and it was not my business to get involved in the first place and I really don't understand this narrative.

Could I really be TA for wanting to defend my brother?",fake names my brother jace is getting married in a month to his fiancée mary and there have been a lot of instances where my brother is displeased with the bride to bes choices one instance is how he doesnt like the style of wedding dresses she likes he hasnt seen her actual wedding dress i have but he knows the general direction of what shed go for ive seen the dress and honestly im certain my brother will despise it secondly shes died her hair into a dirty blonde shade and changed her natural hair color which was chocolate brown my brother adores natural hair and everything natural to be honest so the drastic change she made just a while before the wedding hes not a fan of it thirdly its the thing that broke the camels back for me and lead me to speak up about her behavior shes doing a full glam makeup for the wedding which my brother hates he prefers a light natural makeup the whole thing bothers me because while i understand its her wedding i think she fails to realise its also my brothers wedding and she doesnt respect any of his opinions regarding this she just does whatever she pleases and expects my brother to just suck it up as if his opinion on how this wedding will unroll and his opinion on certain choices doesnt matter so couple days ago i addressed this to her and i made sure my brother knows hes on the right and that im on his side so i addressed it while both of them were present and i said that mary is being really self centered and kind of an ah for not taking into account my brothers opinions and i reminded her how its also his wedding not just hers she went into full defense mode and said that she values his opinion on general stuff like the decorations or what kind of song theyll dance to but she wont let my brother dictate her appearance and that i should take my unsolicited advice and shove it my brother barely reacted and when i looked at him to step in her said you reap what you sow which pretty much means i brought this on myself i was just trying to do a nice thing and stick up for my brother just for him to throw me under the bus anyone ive told this to has said i acted like an ah and it was not my business to get involved in the first place and i really dont understand this narrative could i really be ta for wanting to defend my brother,449,YTA
1901,yu4qkm,AITA for telling my mom she was not a single mother?,telling my mom she was not a single mother,"My parents divorced when I was seven as my dad had an affair. My mom has even admitted she didn't really love him and the affair hurt her pride more than anything else. They were also heavily pressured to marry by their parents, so that makes sense. I'm not condoning what my dad did but it was pretty clear the marriage was for show.

Anyway my dad married his affair partner ""Emma"" and she was the best stepmom a kid could ask for. She always tried to make me feel like her own. My mom married ""Owen"" a few years later and he really didn't give a shit about me. That being said Owen clearly loves my mom, lavishes her in attention, so she had emotional, financial support. Also if he needed to do something for me, like say she was sick and I needed a ride, he would. He just never really engaged with me.

As a result I preferred my dad's house. My mom didn't really put up a fuss when I began spending all of my time there. She would take me on some weekends to do fun stuff but she wasn't that into the day to day stuff. I don't hate her or anything and we have an ok relationship, but I do prefer my dad and Emma.

I am currently getting married. We'll call her ""Kate"" Kate has a civil but shallow relationship with my mom and a great relationship with Emma. Emma has been helping her with a lot of the wedding planning though my mom is literally a wedding planner so I think that might irritate her a bit.

Well recently Kate contacted my mom to talk to her about her mother of the groom dress. We want our parents to match our aesthetic. Kate asked my mom to wear yellow and my mom didn't seem to have a problem at first, but did make a snide comment about how it isn't fair that the bride's mom gets to chose first. Kate let it slip that her mom and Emma had already chosen and my mom lost it.

She called Kate disrespectful, said she couldn't wear yellow because she was blonde (what???) At this point Owen started laughing at our wedding colors so I got annoyed. My mom tried to guilt me by saying it wasn't fair and Emma and my dad could give me more attention and fun but my mom was a single mom.

I laughed and said she was not a single mom. She was married. He helped out if he had to, was a great financial provider, and clearly makes her happy so I don't want to hear her whining.

My mom snapped at me that she was a single mom and I'm devaluing that and choosing my cheating dad over her again. She called Kate a bitch and said she would not be wearing yellow.

1917,yu8tm5,AITA for leaving after being told to be quiet at dinner?,leaving after being told to be quiet at dinner,"The title probably makes it sound worse than it was, but I’m still conflicted.

My (f21) boyfriend (m24) of almost a year, invited me to dinner with his family. (Mom, dad and his 16yr old brother.) Never met them prior to that. The only thing I knew about them is that they’re conservative and christians but lovely people. 

And they were. I got along really well with them, before dinner. They were lovely and talkative. When it was time for dinner, my bfs dad wanted to pray. After praying he said, something alone the lines of “let us dig and let the food keep us quiet.” This is a pretty popular saying in our country, mostly told to young children in school. My understanding of this has always been that you shouldn’t speak with food in your mouth or be extremely loud at the table. I wouldn't say its a cultural thing, though.

I dug in, took a bite. It was fish soup. Absolutely delicious. And y’know, like a good guest I wanted to compliment the cook. “This is delicious - is it saffron? A perfect autumn soup!” My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, “Let the food keep us quiet.” I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word. Super awkward and weird, especially since they had been so talkative before. My bf was also unusually quiet. 

After a few minutes I was too weirded out and asked about their day, and how nice it was that they invited me there. And his mother did the hush thing? So awkward. I think this is when it clicked, no speaking at all at the table. Let the food keep us quiet. Really quiet. But this was a super awkward situation, and I couldn’t deal with that. Imagine sitting at a table with 5 people, everybody eating soup looking dead serious. So I laughed, it just slipped out. Ended up being told off by bfs parents that I was being disrespectful etc. and if I didn’t respect how their household worked I could eat alone in the kitchen. (We were eating in like a separate dining room.) Sooo I thanked them for the food and left to the hotel me and bf stayed at.

My boyfriend later told me that was an asshole move, that I should’ve just kept quiet or eat alone in the kitchen. I understand their family traditions and rules, but it was so weird. I just couldn't take it anymore.

1918,yuaual,AITA for 'crashing' my ex's mother's funeral and telling his children I'm carrying their sibling?,crashing my exs mothers funeral and telling his children im carrying their sibling,"My ex's mother and I were very close. I knew her from long before I started seeing her son. I saw her as my own mother. We kept close contact up until the end. When I found out she'd passed I was devastated. Her funeral was yesterday and I went without receiving an invite (didn't know you needed an invite to a funeral but I guess this is important for later).

If you didn't get it from the title, I'm pregnant with my ex's child. Unfortunate situation since he's back with his wife and things are tense but that's the current situation. I was going there just for the funeral and to pay respect to an amazing women who was treated me like her own child. I even sat at the back so as to avoid getting attention however attention came and my ex's wife came to me saying that I was not invited and crashing the funeral so I must leave. Luckily my ex's older brother intervened and said that I was welcomed. The only problem is that after this he basically forced me to sit further in the front (literally put his arm around me and led me to the front despite me saying I was fine) to sit in the row reserved for family, directly behind my ex, his wife and their kids. While people were looking at the body (open casket) their kids saw me they came to hug me and noticed my stomach was big so asked if I was pregnant. Their mother butted in and made a snarky comment like ""yes darlings, she just can't stop making them"". Mind you I only have one other child so this comment was purely just to make me sound like some loose woman. But still, I bit my tongue. 

The youngest then asked if the child will have my red hair and her mother scoffed and under her breath said something like God forbid. So I was like maybe but your dad has brown hair so the baby could just look exactly like you guys since the baby would be their younger sister or brother. Their mother overheard this and immediately called the kids back to her. I left as soon as the funeral was over. I got a call later that night from my ex saying that I was an asshole for telling their kids about the baby without talking to them first and told me to stay away from his family. Aita?

We used to be really close but have had some issues since he left my mom for another woman about four years ago. 

I want to have some sympathy because I get there were cultural issues at play and he is a different person right now. It's like he is really living for the first time, but I just can't forgive the adultery or what he did to my mom.

Out of my four siblings, three are on his side and one is on his side. She is the only one who attended their wedding or will spend holidays with him. Well apparently he was drunk the other weekend and said something to his wife about how being a parent his so thankless and sometimes he regrets it ""or at least regrets the other ones. Madeline is cool"" This was reported to be by his wife's son's girlfriend who is one of my bridesmaids.

It felt like a knife in my heart. I intimidately confronted him and he apologized profusely. He looked like he was about to cry, but said it really hurts that we won't except his wife and he feels like everyone just saw him as a paycheck and a person to fix their problems and no one cared if he was happy. I replied that it wasn't his kids job to make him happy and cheating still isn't ok. I said I couldn't let go of the hurt of what he said and I don't get how he could even say that, drunk or not, joking or not, and I no longer feel comfortable with him walking me down the aisle.

He was clearly upset but said there wasn't much he could do. He also threw his stepson and my friend out of his house which upset me, but he is still willing to pay for the wedding so I feel like it is ok to let him pay, but my sister called me a gold digger and my future MIL said he should cut me off.

1930,yuczt4,AITA for asking my fiancee to pay bills,asking my fiancee to pay bills,"A little background.  My (37m) fiancee (30f) and I have been butting heads about money.   I make about double what she does but ask her to pay for half of our very reasonable mortgage (540 each) and utilities (150-200 each). We both work full time. She makes about $60k and has a pretty high school loans balance that costs her 850 a month.  When it's all said and done this leaves her with about $45 a day budget. I also ask her to split things like groceries which we put on a joint cc in my name.  

Lately she's been talking about how low her bank account is and how stressed out she is.  She does things she likes such as go to yoga multiple times a week , goes to therapy weekly which I encourage, eats healthy foods etc.  She's taken this I'm going to do what I want and not sacrifice my mental health and happiness for money attitude.  This is fine but she said she might not be able to pay her personal card in full this month which stresses me out.

I use the extra money I make to help us do nice things like vacations. For the past two years I have been taking most of my extra money paying down our mortgage which I should be able to pay off in the spring.  I have also gone on a few vacations by myself so I don't want to make it sound like I'm not also using the extra income for any fun.  The main motivation for paying off the mortgage is making both of our lives better by lowering our overall bills. I also plan on taking all the tax and whatnot  after the mortgage is paid off so she is only paying utilities.  

My position is she makes enough money to have a reasonable budget and should be able to stick to that.  Being financially responsible is a very important thing to me. I've tried to talk to her repeatedly about this but it always devolves into a fight about how I'm not in her Position and how I have money to do whatever I want etc. So AITA for expecting her to be able to pay basic bills and balance her income?

Edit format



2nd edit .   I should have probably mentioned in the original post that we both have been splitting things equally for years and this was the expectation when we moved in together in 2020.  Also the cost of the mortgage we split is significantly cheaper than her rent was prior to moving in.





Final update.  Seems like responses are split for some but main takeaways here are 


Equitable % of mortgage and utilities seems more fair, I will look into this.  The fact that the mortgage is in my name is triggering some people here.  Sorry guys and gals I happened to buy a house before I met my SO, whoops.  

We should probably sit down and talk to a financial person, if nothing else maybe advice from a neutral 3rd person will be good for both of us to hear.

Thanks for those who had helpful thoughtful responses.  To those folks who are like why would a woman pay any rent all I can say is good luck out there !


This got more popular than expected so decided to make one last update.  Based on comments here I'm going to offer to pay 2/3rds mortgage and utilities which should free up more $ for her immediately to help with stress and be more equitable.  I left this out of the original post but I'm also planning on paying her car note off this month for the same reason.   This will benefit her more immediately and directly than paying off the mortgage quite as fast. 

  I have to say some of y'all have no idea how houses work.  You don't just throw someone on the deed , it doesn't work like that.  Also I owned the house for 8 years before we met and if she wasn't helping pay the mortgage at this cheap house she wouldn't be magically living for free or cheaper elsewhere.  Peace out thanks for the input ✌️",a little background my m fiancee f and i have been butting heads about money i make about double what she does but ask her to pay for half of our very reasonable mortgage each and utilities each we both work full time she makes about k and has a pretty high school loans balance that costs her a month when its all said and done this leaves her with about a day budget i also ask her to split things like groceries which we put on a joint cc in my name lately shes been talking about how low her bank account is and how stressed out she is she does things she likes such as go to yoga multiple times a week goes to therapy weekly which i encourage eats healthy foods etc shes taken this im going to do what i want and not sacrifice my mental health and happiness for money attitude this is fine but she said she might not be able to pay her personal card in full this month which stresses me out i use the extra money i make to help us do nice things like vacations for the past two years i have been taking most of my extra money paying down our mortgage which i should be able to pay off in the spring i have also gone on a few vacations by myself so i dont want to make it sound like im not also using the extra income for any fun the main motivation for paying off the mortgage is making both of our lives better by lowering our overall bills i also plan on taking all the tax and whatnot after the mortgage is paid off so she is only paying utilities my position is she makes enough money to have a reasonable budget and should be able to stick to that being financially responsible is a very important thing to me ive tried to talk to her repeatedly about this but it always devolves into a fight about how im not in her position and how i have money to do whatever i want etc so  for expecting her to be able to pay basic bills and balance her income edit format nd edit i should have probably mentioned in the original post that we both have been splitting things equally for years and this was the expectation when we moved in together in also the cost of the mortgage we split is significantly cheaper than her rent was prior to moving in final update seems like responses are split for some but main takeaways here are equitable of mortgage and utilities seems more fair i will look into this the fact that the mortgage is in my name is triggering some people here sorry guys and gals i happened to buy a house before i met my so whoops we should probably sit down and talk to a financial person if nothing else maybe advice from a neutral rd person will be good for both of us to hear thanks for those who had helpful thoughtful responses to those folks who are like why would a woman pay any rent all i can say is good luck out there this got more popular than expected so decided to make one last update based on comments here im going to offer to pay rds mortgage and utilities which should free up more for her immediately to help with stress and be more equitable i left this out of the original post but im also planning on paying her car note off this month for the same reason this will benefit her more immediately and directly than paying off the mortgage quite as fast i have to say some of yall have no idea how houses work you dont just throw someone on the deed it doesnt work like that also i owned the house for years before we met and if she wasnt helping pay the mortgage at this cheap house she wouldnt be magically living for free or cheaper elsewhere peace out thanks for the input ✌️,693,YTA
1931,yugqml,AITA for asking a former student to speak to my class?,asking a former student to speak to my class,"I (F55) am a teacher at a small elementary school. One of my former student has made a name for herself as an up and coming business woman in our state. I’m very proud and know I played a part in her success.

A couple days ago I was picking up coffee at a local coffee shop and happen to see this young woman at one of the tables. I walked up to her and said hello and asked her if she remembered me “Mrs. X her former Kindergarten teacher”. She looked up from her iPad and very curtly replied “Yes” before going back to her iPad.

I then proceeded to ask her if she would be willing to come and speak to my class about her success and encourage them. She looked up again and replied “No”. I then pressed her and asked her why she couldn’t spare any time to speak to my kindergartners. She replied that she didn’t want to. 

I pressed again and this time she exploded at me. She said that my actions of labeling her “special needs” and talking with her parents about holding her back a year had a significant impact on her self esteem and school life and she wanted nothing to do with me. I replied that I was looking out for her best interests and I wanted to make sure she didn’t struggle with school. She imploded again and said the only thing my actions did was cause her parents to not let her participate in extra curricular activities and enroll her in unnecessary remedial programs. She claims she spent the first 10 years of school thinking she was one of the “dumb kids” solely because of me.

1933,yufiyv,AITA for trying to contact my mom?,trying to contact my mom,"My mom (48F) and I (29M) have never really been close. We’re just two different people. When I was 7, my parents divorced. My dad had fallen in love with another woman. They had joint custody so I spent half my time with my mom in her tiny apartment and my time with my dad and stepmom in our house. My mom worked constantly. My stepmom was incredible and treated me like her own son. We grew very close and naturally I gravitated towards them especially in my teen years. My mom was upset. I’ve overheard her complaining about them constantly to her friends. She stopped once I stood up for my stepmom. 

It all came to a head when I got married almost 10 years ago. My mom wasn’t supportive of us getting married but my dad and stepmom were very happy. The last straw was when wedding invitations had an issue where it just said my dad and my stepmom’s name and they had accidentally left off the third name-my mom for my side of the family. My mom sent me a message that said she loved me. She wouldn’t come to the wedding and I should never contact her again. That was the last I heard from my mom.

I miss my mom more and more as the years went on. We might’ve not been best friends but she’s still my mom.

My wife was browsing on social media when she saw my mom in a mother’s day post. We did some digging and found that my mom had gotten remarried and had two kids-a boy and girl. It was my half sister’s account. I messaged my half sister, introduced myself, and asked if I could speak to my mom. She replied “MY mom doesn’t want to speak to you k bye” and a string of emojis. I messaged her again and she blocked me.

We told our friends about this and most of them are split.

I didn’t want to give him a plus one but my husband begged since he was traveling and didn’t know anyone else at the wedding and he didn’t want him to be uncomfortable or have to travel alone. I said fine just to make him happy. 

Flash forward to the reception I see him with some girl I have never seen before. I asked husband what was up and he told me that his friend and his gf broke up a few days before the wedding and since he already rsvped as 2 he brought a friend with him.

He said ok and didn’t make a fuss but he left with her and didn’t come back. I though on everything was fine and had a great night.

He suddenly flipped out and told me that he won't give me his boss's number and that I should quit asking and treating him like a 4 year old. I have to say that I found this reaction horrific because I already explained to him why I need the number. My husband told me to leave it alone and that I don't need the number just because I'm being ""paranoid"".

The thing is, I spent six years in prison. I got out when I was 29. 

My family, my brother and dad included, didn’t visit me inside at all. It hurt me more than I can imagine, and yeah I have held a bit of a grudge. 

Since my dad died, my brother has reached out to me and has asked me to help plan certain aspects of the service. While him and I have been working on our relationship, I won’t lie that I got upset and told him that I would go to the funeral but I wasn’t going to help plan it. 

When he asked me why I told him that the fact that he didn’t visit me at all when I was inside means that I don’t think I should have to be involved with the service.

Girl 15 and twin boys 14. They are at the stage where they want very expensive things for Christmas. Their grades are ok, they do their chores, and are mostly kind to each other. They are just normal kids. 
We asked them what they wanted for Christmas. A few things were reasonable, socks, hair stuff, things for sports. But they each wanted new iPhones, expensive name brand clothes and shoes, game systems, jewelry,bags etc. My wife and I added it up and it was a few thousand. My wife and I have jobs where we could “afford” this but it’s ridiculous. So she and I said that if the kids research the companies, where they source the material, how much the companies make, what they pay their employees etc. This is only for the expensive gifts. The research has to be detailed and they have to justify why they want the gifts and how it would improve their lives. 
Of course they “cried” about it. My daughter said “But that’s like 6 research papers!” and my sons are upset that they can’t share the work. 
Our families and friends heard about it. While some people approve of it, others called us terrible parents and assholes. My aunt said she would call CPS. Both of our mothers said that they should just be kids, and give them their presents. 
I want to say that they will get things that they need. My daughter needs new eyeglass and I will get her the pair she wants but she doesn’t need an iPhone 14, nor does she need Kylie makeup when Target exists. My sons don’t need several pairs of gym shoes. But they DO need shoes for basketball, but the ones they want they plan not to even play sports in.
I know Christmas is about giving but we think it’s fair to have them work for it. We are giving them until December 5th to finish the reports, if not then they won’t get that present.
Is this too far? Are we assholes?

She lived in the same neighbourhood and went to the same school as my son ""Sam"" (27m), where they became friends. They have been together for about 6 years and married for 2. Leylah is currently 6 months pregnant with my first grandchild. 

At some point in her life Leylah had a traumatic experience involving food, which caused her to eat only 3-4 things for a long time and she was diagnosed with eating disorder. With Sam she managed to expand her menu and is less scared to try new things. Normally when Leylah tries a new food and likes it Sam makes sure to celebrate it.

We had a pre thanksgiving dinner this weekend as Leylah and Sam were planning to have a small holiday with Leylah's aunty in Greece. We get talking and I have asked how they are doing and if they have any news, hoping they will share something about my grandchild. Instead Leylah started talking how she tried onion for the first time in years in that very nice Greek restaurant and how much she enjoyed the taste. I have stopped her half way there and said I don't think that trying an onion is an achievement and wanted to hear how my grandchild is doing and if they know the gender yet.

Leylah got really quiet and Sam told me and my husband they will be leaving. I have asked what is wrong and Sam had a go at me saying I am being a massive asshole for not caring about Leylah and her happiness, for putting her down and making her feel like an incubator for my grand babies and to her eating a new food is an achievement due to extremely traumatic past. He also said he is not sure if he wants to let me to have access to my grandchild due to how I have treated the future mother. After both of them left.

My ex husband and I got divorced when our daughter(F16) was 9. I got custody and he only had visitations. Nova was always a daddy's girl and hated being away from him and when we got divorced he was free to play the fun parent for her so it got even worse. She did everything she could to make me let her live with her dad. She was rude and misbehaved until when she was 14 I told her I can't do this anymore. I asked her why she is acting like this and she said she wants me to let her live with her dad so I told her she can live with her dad but if she changes her mind she can come back. She left and didn't even come to see me for 2 years. 

She called me a few weeks ago and said she wants to stay with me one or two weekends a month from now on. I told her I'm glad and I'm looking forward it.

Last weekend she came home I told her she can sleep on the couch. She asked me why she can't stay in her bedroom. I told her that my boyfriend who I live with has 2 daughters and that bedroom is theirs now. The room is too small for 3 people so she has to sleep on the couch.

She called me an asshole and and said there is no way she'll sleep on the couch. She called her dad who picked her up in an hour and left.

She sent me a text and said since I don't have a place for her in my home, she won't come back

I think she is acting very entitled because she left and didn't come back for 2 years. She can't expect me to keep her room empty

Edit: I called my daughter to apologize for not telling her about the room situation sooner and offer to do something together. It didn't go well. She was screaming at me the entire time for ""not wanting her"" and told me she doesn't want to see me again and wants to stay with the parent who ""actually loves her"" I tried to explain to her that it's not true and I love her and I want her but she hung up the phone and I think she's blocked me.

I didn't want to talk to her dad so I called her grandparents to ask them to get her to talk to me. They refused and accused me of being neglectful and told me they are against her coming back to my home.

1982,yuzl0p,AITA for letting my mother have a copy of the key to our new home despite my wife's objection?,letting my mother have a copy of the key to our new home despite my wifes objection,"

**situation**


I (M34) recently bought a one-story house. Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name.


When my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't say anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said ""why?!"" Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel ""comfortable"" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should ""disqualify her"" from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. She screamed at me saying that ""technically"" she did contribute towards the house savings back when she used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep undermining her input.


We've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now ""letting me know"" that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it.

1983,yuz19l,AITA for telling my daughter she can’t go to her dream school but paying for my son to go to his?,telling my daughter she can’t go to her dream school but paying for my son to go to his,"I’m 49m and I have 2 children, Jake (23) and Nikki (17). Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades.

Jake got into his dream school but didn’t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it’s expensive. I didn’t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I’m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He’s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I’m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he’ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure.

Nikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she’s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she’s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can’t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don’t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that’s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment. 

I’ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I’ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I’ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there’s no way I’m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she’s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites. 

I feel terrible so I’m beginning to doubt myself. Am I wrong?

Edit to answer a recurring question:

I thought I made it clear but apparently I didn’t. I’m not limiting Nikki’s education to $20,000 a year. I told her that’s the max I’m willing to pay for her education degree. I’m more than happy to pay $75,000 a year if she picks another degree that will have a better return. For a while she thought about being a doctor and fell in love with England (we have family there) so I even offered to pay for her to go to Oxford which will be double the cost of her brother’s tuition. But she’s adamant about being a middle school teacher and I’m unwilling to spend $300,000 that I worked hard for on an education degree.

Edit to add: Oxford is hard to get into, I know that she won’t be able to just walk in. I meant for her to apply and if she got in, I’m willing to pay the cost of that school and the expense of living in an expensive country if her degree earning potential warrants that cost.

Edit to answer a recurring question #2:

Why did I bring up the family tradition? Am I an elitist? Why does it matter?

I brought it up because getting into dental schools and graduating is tough. The reason why we have so many in our family is because we help each other out. The dentists and oral surgeons in the family happily tutor and give valuable internship experiences that would otherwise not be available.

My ex usually cuts our younger son's (6, almost 7) hair or takes him to the barber.  He's had the same hairstyle for most of his life which is a typical length boy's hairstyle, maybe 1-2 inches long with a fade on the side. We do not get along and he is high conflict about every little thing I do.

Well I got tired of the hairstyle and felt it was too long and decided to try and cut our son's hair.  My son refused and said he didn't want a haircut at first, that he wanted his dad to do it, but I figure I am the parent and he is 6, not 13, so I told him this had to be done. After the haircut admittedly it was a bit too short and uneven so I shaved it off and told my son it would grow back fast and I'd make sure not to cut it so short next time.  He was upset at first especially because his older brother started teasing him about it (I put a stop to that) and he got over it, and is fine with it now and just wears a hat or puts his hoodie over it if he is cold.

I took our sons to the exchange with their dad, and immediately my ex takes a look at him and says ""what happened, did he have lice?"" which of course makes my son feel self conscious about his hair again.  I guess my ex must have talked to our son about his haircut because he starts texting me the next day bossing me around and asking me if I could ""try not to cut his hair this way again as our son doesn't like it and it looks bad and there are uneven patches everywhere (which is BS because my son told me he is ok with it now before going to his dads)"".  He also told me he gets his hair cut at a barber and just had it cut 2 weeks prior so he felt it was ""unnecessary"" to ""shave him bald"" and if I feel it is too long I can just ""let him know and he can take him to the barber"". He was also apparently furious because our son told him if I didn't let him cut his hair I was going to take his tablet away.

I got mad and told him I am the parent, to mind his business and stop harassing me about what I do at my own house and that our son was fine with his haircut before my ex started meddling.  Which then prompted him to point to a ridiculous clause in our custody agreement stating that we have joint legal so we must ""consult before radically changing children's hairstyles"".

So 1) I just cut my son's hair. My ex cuts his hair all the time and doesn't ask me.

2) I don't think shaving a child's hair is considered ""radically changing hairstyles"". I did not dye his hair or give him a mohawk or something.

3) our son was fine with his haircut before my ex started meddling.

2006,yv9ub1,AITA For Taking Back Our Groceries That My Wife Gave to Her Sister,taking back our groceries that my wife gave to her sister,"My wife (30) wife has a younger sister (28) with four kids. My SIL is a married SAHM and her husband (31) works 35 hours per week. Money is tight for them, but they still go on annual vacations, drive newer cars etc. My wife and I keep separate finances except for a joint credit card and household bill. I also do most of the grocery shopping. This is relevant for later.

A couple years ago, I found out my wife had been buying groceries for my SIL on our joint card (about $150-$200 per month for a few months). She said that her sister had come to her saying they were tight on money and that she needed help feeding their kids. This about a month after they had got back from their most recent vacation in Mexico. I told my wife in no uncertain terms that I am not supporting their family. She argued with me saying that we could more than afford it. I replied that I don’t care if she wanted to support them, but that’s her business. My wife stopped buying them groceries on our joint card after, but I'm sure she told her sister because SIL has been standoffish since.

In the last few months grocery costs have been increasing thanks to inflation. As a cost-saving measure, I bought a whole cow for about $4K (which works out to about $9/lb and will last us more than a year) and my wife and I split the cost.

Yesterday I went to the freezer to pull some steaks and saw the amount of beef was visibly lower. I checked our security cameras and saw my wife leaving the house with a big box. I texted her demanding to know if she had taken a bunch of our meat to SIL, and she replied yes. I grabbed SIL’s keys (we have a copy), drove to their house, knocked on her door and when SIL answered I told her that and I was taking back what my wife brought over.

SIL protested saying I was taking food out of her kids mouths, but I said I don’t care. She already had one roast in the oven, I went to their freezer and they had about 40-50lbs of ground beef, steaks, and roasts from our cow, including a couple prime rib roasts. I grabbed it all except the roast in the oven and drove home. My wife yelled at me saying she couldn’t believe how selfish I was and that SIL called her crying. She also said that she paid for half of it and so she could do whatever she liked with it. I yelled back saying you don’t get to decide to give away anything that we pay for together and said she acted like a sneak thief for doing it behind my back.

My wife is still angry at me and says until I apologize to her sister. return the meat that I took back, and apologize for calling her a thief, she won’t speak to me.

She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one.

On the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways .

Recently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour.

But sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out.

Edit: why are all of you assuming I don’t support her? I go with her to every convention she’s speaking at and I also love that she started a group
for younger girls interested in stem. I support all of her endeavors.

Edit: I talked to her. We are now having the biggest argument we’ve ever had. I grilled her on whether or not she had attraction towards my dad. She said she didn’t but maybe she does now considering he’s willing to stick up for her and shows her loving behavior. I’m not answering anymore comments or updating anymore because I have a lot bigger issues to deal with.

I (26 M) started dating Riley (23 F) six months ago. Riley is in a masters program for astrophysics. My dad is a physics teachers at the local high school. As a result the two of them when together, chat about their interests and ideas for my dads lessons in the future. They get so absorbed into the conversation that they often forget about their surroundings and it can be quite aggravating. I can tell it bothers my mom as well.

This past Sunday, my parents invited us over for dinner with several of our family members as well. On Friday, I asked Riley if she could stop herself from talking about physics with my dad as my other family will be there and it will look rude. She seemed displeased and said she wasn’t happy because she loves talking to my dad about it but, she understood and wouldn’t do it. Sunday we arrived early to help my mom and dad set up and I asked my dad the same thing I asked Riley. He got very upset and told me that this was his house and I should not have asked Riley to stop herself from bonding with them (my parents) and talking about things they both enjoy. My mom sided with me saying it was obnoxious to hear the two of them blabber. I saw Riley’s expression fall when my mom said this. My dad got more upset and said it wasn’t blabbering. I agree it was a little harsh but at the same time it was true. After dinner during coffee my dad encouraged Riley to share her ideas if she had any and she smiled and said they will talk about it next time. When we left Riley said it hurt that my dad was the one who defended her from my moms comment and not me. I told her although it was harsh, I agree.

I'm sure I will miss details with the character limit. Wife and I have 3 kids and our last born almost did her in. She and our son were hospitalized for a week and it was incredibly nerve wracking and traumatic. Important info. Also the other part of important info.. my wife does not like dogs (more so she doesn't like ""dog mom's/dad's"" but you get my point). She has more than enough reason not to and I will answer questions on that but if asked in the comments. But either way, just know she has many, many reasons and all of them are valid. 

As you can imagine, we do not have dogs. Never plan to either. My family is huge on animals though, dogs especially. My parents however are very much so respectful of my wife's concerns when it comes to dogs around our kids and they never, ever push the issue. My sister is the complete opposite. She has 2 German Shepherds, a Great Dane and two ankle biters of some sort that are Heeler breed mixes. They go everywhere with her, including to her job. My wife avoids family gatherings that involve my sister and I don't blame her. When we host at our place, the dogs are not invited which means my sister hardly ever comes. This has caused fights in the past because my sister says we are denying ""her children"" happiness and family time. She knows about my wife's severe trauma and thinks she should just get over it, basically. My wife is in therapy, by the way. So please don't pull the ""your wife needs therapy"" lines. 

Anywho: we hosted dinner at our place yesterday evening and my sister decided to join for once. At some point it got on the topic of traumatic births. My wife doesn't generally talk about hers but my mom started asking questions (she went through a traumatic birth herself so it was an innocent conversation). My sister continuously interjected with stories about her dog and was minimizing my wife's struggles in a way that I'm sure affected her more than me. Basically saying ""every mom goes through struggles, *EVEN DOG MOMS* and it's not that serious"". At one point I did tell my sister to shut the fuck up but she kept at it. My wife full snaps. Stands up from the table, slams her fists and starts berating my sister saying ""I don't give a flying fuck about your mutts, nor do I care to hear about your imaginary struggles of being a mom when you don't have children and have never almost fucking died and lost your baby at the same god damn time."" This led to her screaming at my sister to get out of the house and told her she had better never show her face here again. I have never seen my wife like this. It was clearly bottled for a long time. Everyone was silent. I told my wife to calm down and stop engaging with the conversation. I wasn't condescending or being an AH. I was calm and just trying to calm her down.

I got a bit disappointed because I was looking forward to spending some time together with her and I told her as much and then I said that maybe it would be better if she'd just give up on seafood all together. 

I know she likes it but sometimes it can be an inconvenience to me and I feel like she should be willing to give up on such a small thing for us. She got upset by my request and said that she loves me but that she's sorry cuz she's not giving up on eating it and that lowering the amount of times she does was already enough.

Her family eats seafood often and she grew up eating a lot of it so I kinda get why it would be hard for her to give up on it but I think that if she cared enough she'd be willing to do it. 
So AITA.",i m am allergic to seafood unfortunately my f gf adores it ever since we got together abt years shes made an effort to eat it as less as possible which i appreciate however i wish shed completely stop tbh the other day she went out with her friends at a restaurant when she got back home i tried to kiss her but she stopped me and told me she just ate seafood i got a bit disappointed because i was looking forward to spending some time together with her and i told her as much and then i said that maybe it would be better if shed just give up on seafood all together i know she likes it but sometimes it can be an inconvenience to me and i feel like she should be willing to give up on such a small thing for us she got upset by my request and said that she loves me but that shes sorry cuz shes not giving up on eating it and that lowering the amount of times she does was already enough her family eats seafood often and she grew up eating a lot of it so i kinda get why it would be hard for her to give up on it but i think that if she cared enough shed be willing to do it so,229,YTA

I reminded him that he essentially had both his mom and I all to himself for a very long time and his brothers will never have that. What they can have is spending time with their Big Brother which is like hanging out with with a celebrity.

2029,yvjgbz,AITA for making my brother miss the birth of his first child?,making my brother miss the birth of his first child,"Background- My younger brother (Hameed) 19M, lives with my girlfriend and I. He lives with us both with rent at a discounted rate of 550, (our rent is 2900) he works part time and we encouraged him to save his money for emergencies thus he has spent his extra money on video games, remote controls and food. 

A week ago, my brother’s girlfriend was 9 months pregnant and since they’d split, they’ve been living apart. On the day she was giving birth and her water broke, my brother asked if I could give him a ride to the hospital so he could be there for his daughter’s birth - I told him no since my girlfriend and I had a date set and I wasn’t going to cancel the plans I had for her that day. She was already dressed up and the restaurant I was taking her to was high-end. 

We don’t have much family where we live outside of our aunt who lives 2 hours away and our mom who lives in another state. He has asked me to give him rides before, particularly to doctors appointments but I always refused because I told him if he’s having a kid, he’s not a kid and he should start carrying his adult responsibilities. He was distraught and started calling our aunt who told him she couldn’t help due to distance and he then called the hospital and ambulance, asking for transportation even though I told him that would be impossible for them to do so. He then tried calling an Uber and Lyft, but the hospital is 45 minutes away and we live in the city, so prices were steep. He began pacing back and forth through the halls and begged me to cashapp him $40 so we could go “half” on his Uber fare, and said he’d pay me back when he got his next check, I declined.

He then insisted that he ride along with my girlfriend and I, since the restaurant we were going to was in the same direction as the hospital, I refused again and explained to him that the hospital was 20 minutes further than our restaurant and that we would miss our reservation if we did so - and reminded him that this is not our responsibility. He became frantic and frustrated at once and started sobbing explaining that her pregnancy was high risk and that she didn’t have any “real family” outside of her grandmother who couldn’t be there for the birth due to health issues to my understanding. He explained that she was in the “hospital in labor alone” which I find hard to believe, but still, I stood my ground and told him we couldn’t help. 

He stormed to his room and told my girlfriend and I that he hated us both. I could hear him in his room crying before we headed out. While on our date, he sent a lengthy message telling me how much he hated me. I explained if he doesn’t like his living situation, he can move. This was a week ago and I feel as though he has been avoiding me. He hasn’t spoken to me except to ask for a ride to work and back. His responses are usually short now and he is very distant.

In the park was a skatepark.

It had these tiny like bollard entrances which I could not fit through if I wanted to. It just really bothered me that my tax dollars were being used to pay for a facility that I could not use if I wanted to. That did not seem fair. So I wrote emails to the parks department, they asked me if I wanted to come to a meeting and the board agreed with me to change the entrances. To me it was a small victory and made me feel good that my city government was sticking up for all of us. 

They had to cut out the bollard entrance and then the project ran into some delays. it wasn't too big of a deal but the park has to be shut down for about 3-6 months for safety reasons. 

People have somehow connected me to the skatepark being shut down. The kids have been especially cruel but some adults have been as well. All the normal f@t b!tch slings I've heard since I was in kindergarten but also K@ren has come into play. 

I am posting here today because I was just walking my dog and this group of 11 year olds started yelling at me and I asked them if they would like if someone spoke to their mothers like they were to me. One of them said ""it's always the 2's who mouth off, if she were hot she'd know to keep her mouth shut"" I asked him if his parents were around. He said his uncle was right over there. I went up to his uncle and his uncle said the kid was being generous calling me a 2. I asked him if he felt he was a good example to those boys. He made some really disgusting fat comments and I left trying but failing to maintain my composure. 


I'm afraid to go back to the park now obviously so now my small win feels like a major defeat and I feel like an asshole. Was I one?

2033,yvdhvr,AITA for being nude in front of friends,being nude in front of friends,"I have done some modeling over the years, and was recently approached by a photographer for a commissioned session. He paid very well - much more than I have ever been paid - so after speaking with my husband, I accepted. (My husband and I are both 27.) There were some nude shots involved, so my husband gave his ok with the condition that he must be present. The photographer said fine of course, but I was a little embarrassed to have to make that request. 

Anyway, the session went great, and the photographer is very talented. He gave me a framed print of one of the best shots as a gift, which I am super proud of. I’d like to hang it up in our room or bathroom, but my husband has forbid it, and said he’s actually not happy that I even have a copy. He doesn’t want to talk about it. 

Some close friends of ours (married couple) knew I was doing this shoot and asked about it, and I said it went great and I got a print that is beautiful. They asked to see it, if I’m fine with it. I said I am, but my husband isn’t. This led to a whole big discussion/argument among the 4 of us - my husband said I threw him under the bus, and not-very-jokingly accused them of only wanting to see me nude because I’m African American (he and this couple are white). Needless to say it was extremely embarrassing. (They had at one point made a comment about not having seen an AA woman nude before as an off handed silly comment that was taken out of context.) 

So, these friends stayed overnight at our place Saturday night, and before they arrived he reminded me AGAIN that they were not allowed to see the print. I said yes, fine, but I was seething, exhausted by how he was controlling this. At one point when he was in the bathroom I apologized to them for this whole thing, and they said they were fine (but said they were disappointed they wouldn’t finally be able to see an AA woman naked, which made me laugh so hard that my husband asked what was so funny and I said nothing.)

I didn’t sleep well that night - I was angry thinking about how I had close friends that wanted to share art I had created, but my husband wasn’t being supportive. So, in that state of mind I made a rash decision. After my husband left for a meeting Sunday morning, I didn’t show them the print, but I brought them coffee to their room, wearing absolutely nothing. 

We laughed our asses off. And they clapped! I felt great, but now am feeling guilty, as my husband doesn’t know I did this.

2038,yvccxa,AITA for letting my parents stay when they had nowhere to go?,letting my parents stay when they had nowhere to go,"Throwaway because gf uses reddit.

So my mom has always had an issue with my girlfriend. We have been together 4 years now. The first time they met my gf brought food over to my mom’s for a potluck type of deal. My gf is a very quiet, anxious and introverted person and I think my mom didn’t like that. In the beginning gf really wanted my mom to like her so she invited my mom to lunch after the potluck. My mom said she was busy and then used gf’s phone number from the text to google and found some personal info about gf that I already knew. My parents then called me and tried to use this info to get me to break up with her. They have also called her names, and made assumptions even though they don’t really know her. I do acknowledge this is their fault. Since this happened they have just not gotten along. Gf has avoided them which has been no big deal because they live in another state.

My parents have made some financial missteps and need somewhere to stay. They asked me about a month ago if they could stay with us for a few months because they know we have a spare room. I talked to gf about it and she was definitely weary but she agreed on two conditions: 1) We have a big talk about everything that has happened *before* they move in so she can feel comfortable and 2) That they don’t just immediately move in as soon as they get here.

My parents said this was fine because they planned to stay with a friend in our city for a week when they first got here so we’d have time to talk before they moved in. 

Well, my parents ended up leaving about a few days early and the friend they were supposed to stay with had family over so they couldn’t stay with them. They got here earlier than expected and didn’t have anywhere to go so I didn’t say anything. All four of us went out to dinner the first night and were supposed to talk about everything but I hadn’t seen them in awhile so we spent the time just talking and catching up and I didn’t end up bringing up any of the stuff gf wanted to talk about.

My parents have been here about 2 weeks now and my gf has been in our bedroom most of the time. She works from home so she literally hasn’t left our room. I have tried to talk to her about everything but I have had to work and friends visiting from out of town this past week. She told me I “made her an outsider in her own home,” and that I “don’t care about her boundaries,” which isn’t true I love and want to marry her I just didn’t know what else to do. 

My mom did send her an apology text about what happened before about 5 days before they got here. gf doesn’t think it was genuine because “they spent years ignoring me and are only apologizing now because they need a place to stay.” 

My gf is now saying she doesn’t know if we will make it through this and idk if she is overreacting (she has an anxiety disorder and cptsd) or if I’m in the wrong. AITA?

EDIT: I get it. I fucked up. Please stop sending me Reddit Care Resources and telling me my girlfriend is going to make me homeless. She would never do that. To answer your questions, No, I’m not on the deed and the info my mom found on gf was she used to be a sugar baby. They said she was “money hungry”.

They got engaged last week. This guy is four years older than her, and his first time meeting the family will be at my wedding. 

I’m pissed at her for diminishing the excitement of my wedding with the stress on my parents to have to plan another one so soon after, especially to a guy they haven’t even met.

2048,yvf2ik,"AITA for Wanting a ""Subsidized"" Cruise?",wanting a subsidized cruise," My boyfriend is planning to go on a cruise this winter with his two parents. He and his parents have told me that they would like me to come with them. I'd love to go but have tried to make it as clear as possible that I don't really feel comfortable spending the roughly $400 it would cost to evenly split a double occupancy room with my boyfriend. I live at home with my parents for now and could technically afford the $400 but I'm pretty young and have only just started the first real paid position of my life about half a year ago (a contract that has absolutely no job security) so I've just been trying to save up money and don't really feel like I can justify spending that much on a recreational trip right now.

My boyfriend/his parents have made it clear to me that they're planning on going on this cruise regardless of if I come with them or not. If I don't go my boyfriend will either get a single occupancy room or he and his parents will pay to upgrade his parent's room to a suite and he'll stay in that suite with them. Both of these options are more expensive to them than if I went and evenly split that cost of a double occupancy room with my boyfriend (so me going with them and paying for half the room with my boyfriend saves them money on the cruise). **I've told my boyfriend that what I'm willing to do is cover whatever the difference, if any, there is between the cost of having me join them and the cost they would otherwise pay for the three of them to go by themselves.**

My boyfriend was incensed by this suggestion because he thought it wouldn't be fair for me to pay less to go on this cruise than he and each of his parents were. He said that I would essentially be getting a subsidy paid for by him and/or his parents. But, in my eyes I feel like *I'd* be the one subsidizing the cost of *their* trip if I were to pay the $400 because I'm not the one who's trying to schedule a cruise at this point in my financial life even though I'd love to go.

I did tell my boyfriend that if he goes on the cruise without me I'll be pissed because if he really wanted me there, he'd accept that I'm making an offer to come along with him at no cost to him/his family. It's not like I'm asking him to buy my ticket. I'm willing to contribute money, but I'm asking to only pay whatever the actual additional costs are of me joining them on this cruise.

2051,yvvc84,AITA for not allowing my daughter's half sister to spend christmas with us?,not allowing my daughters half sister to spend christmas with us,"



My ex husband and I got divorced 7 years ago. We share custody of our 13 year old daughter. He got married and has a 5 year old daughter with his now wife.


His daughter would spend time with my daughter regularly. They adore each other but she doesn't come to my house and they rarely meet up there.


His wife has been diagnosed with cancer and has started treatment recently. The other day he came to drop our daughter off and asked to speak to me. He talked about his wife's circumstances then how his family won't be able to have a christmas celebration this year. He said it wasn't fair for his daughter and asked if I could ""include"" her in my family's celebration. He pointed out how the girls will have a great time together bonding and making memories, but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else.

I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feeling comfortable having this conversation. I asked him to leave and he did but still texted me asking me to agree to let his daughter come spend christmas even offered that he stays away if that'll make me less uncomfortable, I said no and now he's calling me selfish and unfeeling.

She asked if she’d replace it “plus a few, since she’s pregnant and craving it” and I said no, because it’s high in sugar (**type 1 diabetic**) and also expensive?

2055,yvivgo,AITA for not wanting an unleashed dog coming up to my wife and I in a dog friendly brewery,not wanting an unleashed dog coming up to my wife and i in a dog friendly brewery,"Throwaway as I don't want my real comment history altering judgement

Wife and I had a Pub Pass to use, its one of the last 5 places we need to finish the book.   Its something where you get a free beer for going to a brewery. Look it up its pretty cool.  Anyway, looking online at the place my wife and I were planning to go it said it was a dog friendly place.

Both my Wife and I are not dog people, we don't like them.  We do our best to avoid them and when they are present we don't interact with them, but are respectful.  Usually a gentle go away is enough.  Its amazing how many people expect you to interact with their dog though.  We knew it was possible that this was a place we wouldn't hang out at long, but went anyway to get our Pub Pass stamp and our free beer.   We didn't plan to be their more than 15 minutes.  This was just a taphouse with rotating food trucks.  No kitchen on site.

We arrive, head to the bar, and take our seat. Its apparent this place is very dog friendly based off the signage.  At the time we saw a few dogs but took seats as far away from dogs as possible.  Well within 2 minutes someone's unleashed dog comes walking up to us and sniffing around my wifes leg, she repositions and it keeps following.  We tell it to go away, it doesn't. I finally grab it by the collar and take it to the otherside of the bar and leave it.  Clearly the owner doesn't care if its wandering.  I go to wash my hands, and get gross dog germs off me.

I come out, sit down, 2 minutes later the dog is back and now is licking me.  Finally, i just yell, ""who's effing dog is this?, effing come get it"". Finally a guy comes over and says ""oh fido is just being friendly, just give it some pets and he'll move along"".  I kinda flipped out, Told him I don't like his dog, i don't know his dog, i don't trust his dog, i don't want to be around it and not so kindly suggested he leash it and keep his dog near him.  My wife agrees with me, but the bartender essentially kicked us out based on my reaction.  So AITA?

Edit:  I looked online at the breweries website.  It does mention leashes being required.  Obviously doesn't mean its enforced.

2065,yvyrhm,AITA for not letting my daughter skip her sister's birthday party?,not letting my daughter skip her sisters birthday party,"I 51m have 3 daughters. Kimberley 17f, Laura 15f and my step daughter Jessica 16f. Needless to say it's hard having 3 teens in the house but Kim and Laura spend 50% of their time at their mom's house which doesn't make it too bad.

Anyway Jessica's birthday is this Saturday and my wife and I were planning a birthday party for her at our house, which I assumed Kim and Laura would attend since Jessica has been their sister for over a year now. But when I asked Kim what she was getting Jessica for her birthday she said she completely forgot about it, I told her to buy something before the party this Saturday and she seemed confused and explained that she and Laura had plans to spend Saturday with my ex wife instead because family was visiting.

I told Kim that she would be attending Jessica's party and she could see her mom on Sunday instead. Kim was rude and back mouthed me, saying she's nearly an adult and I don't get to make these decisions for her.

I grounded Kim for talking back and took away her cell phone and now she's giving me the cold shoulder and my ex wife has been blowing up my phone asking when she can come collect Kim and Laura. I told my ex wife that she won't be collecting either of the girls this week because of Jessica's party, my ex told me that wasn't her problem and that our girls are old enough to decide where they live themselves.

2067,yvyjwy,AITA for having my gf and her child over most nights of the week in a 2/2 apartment with one roommate?,having my gf and her child over most nights of the week in a apartment with one roommate,"Hello everyone, so my (37m) gf (35f) has been spending most nights at my apartment, and even has some of her stuff in just my room (her storage unit is full, and where her apartment is (she pays rent at her sisters apartment, where 4 people live already) there isn't much space) and in my bathroom.

&#x200B;

My roommate (29f) has been having issues with her spending most nights at the apartment, since she feels like she is moving in, without her being in the loop about it.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't feel like she is moving in, since all of her stuff is in strictly my room, the common areas have 0 of her stuff, we hardly ever use the common areas (maybe once a week?) as my roommate is usually in there watching TV (which most of the stuff in the living room is mine).

&#x200B;

My roommate says that my gf doesn't pay rent or utilities, so she shouldn't be there and that we need to set strict rules on how often she is over. Which then she would say she doesn't even live her/isn't on the lease/etc. Which I said that I could get all of that arranged and make it official, which my roommate just said ""No"".

&#x200B;

I pay significantly more rent even though I don't have the ""master room"" (my roommate does and she has her own private bath and \*plenty\* of space to call her own), and the utilities my gf does use, are negligible at most (I compared bills, its maybe a two dollar difference?).

&#x200B;

My GF's daughter (9) does spend the night maybe 4-5 days a week at the apartment, but she is relatively quiet, doesn't bother my roommate and sleeps on an inflatable mattress either in my room or in the living room (my roommate \*usually\* goes to bed around 8 or 9pm, so if my roommate goes to her room, we move my GF's daughter to the living room that way everyone can have a bit more privacy) we have asked my roommate maybe twice what time she is planning on going to bed so we can try to adjust our plans if need be.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Notes: My roommate frequently leaves the front door unlocked with nobody being home, even though I've asked her plenty of times to please lock it behind her. Any mess that is made by us is immediately cleaned up. If my roommate is home she is always in the common areas. We try to keep noise down to a minimum, and adjust if my roommate mentions something (I've also asked to make sure she doesn't hear anything, but thankfully the walls are fairly thick in this apartment). My roommate also sometimes watches dogs for extra money in the apartment without strictly asking me about it, she just tells me the dates that there will be dogs in the apartment, which I also help walk if my roommate decides to spend hours away from the apartment (which is frequent).

2083,yvyt52,WIBTA if I put my foot down and make my parents not invite my uncle for the holidays?,wibta if i put my foot down and make my parents not invite my uncle for the holidays,"Hi! Thanks for your opinions, I really want input before making a decision because I am hurt at the moment and wouldn’t want to be unfair.

So I (female very early 20s) live with my parents (it’s not normal or usual to move out until late 20s or 30s here). Our relationship isn’t the best and I’ve been advised to move out before, I might, honestly.

My uncle cheated on his wife about 1,5-2 years ago and she threw him out (obviously). We took him in and housed all of his belongings (a lot, I had to give up my office room) until he could get back on his feet, gladly. Because he lost his wife and step daughter, he didn’t have anyone to spend some holidays with and we instantly told him to spend it with us (he used to spend some days w wife’s fam and others with us. Now more with us). All this feels normal and the right thing to do to me, because we could do it and had the space. I wouldn’t expect anything in return, ever. I wouldn’t even expect a “thank you” because it was implied.

Last year my bday happened during a low point for him, and he forgot. I was hurt because he is family and I wanted a happy birthday text, if not a call, but I never showed it because he wasn’t doing ok and helping him was a priority. 

This year, he has a gf. I haven’t met her but this info is important i think. He has been asking favors from us (my mom to help him with some finances for his business, favors to get out of doing his share of work to take care of grandma, and other financial and personal favors). I always said yes because he is family. 

Well, he forgot my bday again. Not a text, not a call. I was extremely hurt but didn’t say anything because what would I say? Today, he came to my house and I thought he’d say something. He just came to ask more favors, to which my parents said yes but I stayed out. I didn’t expect or want any presents, but just a happy bday. He was here, talking to me, and didn’t even suspect it had been my bday.

I informed my mom I didn’t want him over for the holidays this year, and that I won’t attend if he comes. He can stay with his gf for all I care, since that is all he cares about (he won’t be alone). She said she can’t not invite him and I said it was fine and I would just not attend dinner because that’s not what family is to me. I also realised that his ex wife always remembered my bdays and special ocassions, but not him. He is my only uncle and godfather. For his bday, we threw him a party with friends and family and I baked his fave cake and bought him a gift. My mom says I’m too dramatic and an AH, but this is normal for her, so I don’t trust her judgment.

I may be letting my anger get the best of me, but I don’t want someone so selfish around.

Elizabeth has only been married to this guy for 3 years so obviously I felt that this was inappropriate, especially since I am Rachel's legal father, my name is on the birth certificate. I chose not to talk to Rachel about it at the time and waited till Elizabeth came by to pick her up to say anything.

I asked Elizabeth if she thought it was appropriate for Rachel to be calling her step dad ""dad"". But Elizabeth said it was our girl's choice and the reason im not listed as dad is because she only sees me every two weeks.

2102,yw8fjo,WIBTA if I asked my sister not to invite two family friends to her wedding?,wibta if i asked my sister not to invite two family friends to her wedding,"My (30,F) sister (35,F) is getting married next summer and I couldn’t be happier for her. Not only am I MOH, I’m also planning the entire wedding. Too many details give my sister anxiety so she’s entrusted all of the planning to me. Basically my sister will tell me what she wants and I will make it happen. My parents are paying for the entire wedding.

Last week my sister gave me a list of wedding guests to review to make sure we didn’t miss anyone and I immediately got flustered when I saw she wanted to invite two of our family friends of 20 years, we’ll call them Sarah and Jeff. My parents met Sarah and Jeff 20 years ago through our church and I became very close friends with their daughter “Melissa”. Melissa and I remained the best of friends for almost 15 years but suddenly things changed and Melissa became a really crappy friend. Long story short: I was always there for her and she was never there for me. Whenever I confronted Melissa, she always claimed it had nothing to do with me, this was just the way she was now. It hurt me deeply and I’ve kept my distance ever since.  Sarah and Jeff are wonderful people and I have nothing against them. It’s just that being around them makes me uncomfortable at times because I have to pretend their daughter didn’t hurt me. My sister is having a micro wedding so I wouldn’t be able to avoid them. 

I know if I told my sister I would rather she not invite them, she would immediately take them off the list because she loves me. I do t want to take advantage of that though. She’s not very close to them. She just thinks they’re nice people and it would be a kind gesture to invite them. I also don’t know if it’s worth it to bring this up because the wedding is in a different state and Sarah and Jeff might decide not to come. So WIBTA if I asked her not to invite Sarah and Jeff?

Edit: thank you everyone for your responses. I’m not going to ask my sister to remove Jeff and Sarah from the list. Instead I’m just going to focus on my wedding planning and MOH duties and keep any interactions with Jeff and Sarah as brief as possible.",my f sister f is getting married next summer and i couldn’t be happier for her not only am i moh i’m also planning the entire wedding too many details give my sister anxiety so she’s entrusted all of the planning to me basically my sister will tell me what she wants and i will make it happen my parents are paying for the entire wedding last week my sister gave me a list of wedding guests to review to make sure we didn’t miss anyone and i immediately got flustered when i saw she wanted to invite two of our family friends of years we’ll call them sarah and jeff my parents met sarah and jeff years ago through our church and i became very close friends with their daughter “melissa” melissa and i remained the best of friends for almost years but suddenly things changed and melissa became a really crappy friend long story short i was always there for her and she was never there for me whenever i confronted melissa she always claimed it had nothing to do with me this was just the way she was now it hurt me deeply and i’ve kept my distance ever since sarah and jeff are wonderful people and i have nothing against them it’s just that being around them makes me uncomfortable at times because i have to pretend their daughter didn’t hurt me my sister is having a micro wedding so i wouldn’t be able to avoid them i know if i told my sister i would rather she not invite them she would immediately take them off the list because she loves me i do t want to take advantage of that though she’s not very close to them she just thinks they’re nice people and it would be a kind gesture to invite them i also don’t know if it’s worth it to bring this up because the wedding is in a different state and sarah and jeff might decide not to come so wibta if i asked her not to invite sarah and jeff edit thank you everyone for your responses i’m not going to ask my sister to remove jeff and sarah from the list instead i’m just going to focus on my wedding planning and moh duties and keep any interactions with jeff and sarah as brief as possible,397,YTA
2104,yw7y3e,"AITA for telling my wife that since she is home full time, she should be doing more?",telling my wife that since she is home full time she should be doing more,"My wife lost the drive she had to work when COVID hit. Kids came home full time and she had to stop work but just never went back to work when they went back to school, outside of collectively 4 months. Her and I worked together at one point at an incredibly well paying job but as soon as she got in to a position of power and people started giving her a hard time, she cracked and couldn't do it anymore. She quit the next day. People there really were pieces of absolute shit and I defended her when I could but she couldn't stick it out. She was making $28 an hour. It was a great loss with her quitting. Since then she has sat home and plays games that generate money on her phone. She has like 8 apps that generate money but it's not much. So she sits home, all day. Doing essentially nothing outside of cooking meals. She cleans thoroughly maybe once a week so I always come home from work to a semi-dirty house in-between the kids and the animals. 

I'm honestly becoming fed up due to the house looking the way that it does. At this point I'm starting to think she just lounges around all day. I've talked to her about getting a job and she will apply for places but if she doesn't get a call back or if they give the position to someone else, she immediately becomes discouraged and stops trying again. She gets child support for one of her kids (whom I consider mine but are not biologically) but both her children's father's are dead beats and do not take the kids at all and while she is pushing to go through the courts, that hasn't been much of anything either (that is not her fault- she is trying there). I absolutely know for certain that she is depressed but I'm starting to lose myself mentally because of the house clutter and being the sole provider. Of course I want her to get help but at this point I'm more concerned with the fact that I'm constantly broke. Sure, she absolutely makes up for it in other departments and she treats me incredibly well but I'm just frustrated.

So yesterday I was feeling off and didn't feel like speaking at all. She asked me what was wrong and I said nothing. That I was fine. Later on I caved and mentioned the job thing again and she asked if that was what was bothering me. I told her it was, mixed with the house looking the way it does. It's not even dirty dirty. Just unswept floors and dishes that always seem to pile up no matter how much they get washed. She asked if I understood how much she does during the day for upkeep and I was honest and said no. Doesn't look like she does anything at all and that it would be nice if she was doing more. She starts crying. Says I make her feel like an absolute burden and that she's tired of trying when it's not like I notice anyways. She then shows me pictures of the house absolutely trashed and says ""This is what I fucking deal with every single day while you're gone because of your unruly dog."" She then pulls up indeed. 181 applications sent out in the past 2 months. And now she says she is done trying.

2112,ywg85g,AITA for voicing unhappiness about my brother getting half of the inheritance?,voicing unhappiness about my brother getting half of the inheritance,"My older brother and I never really had any sort of relationship. He had his own life when he was pretty young. He married young and our family (parents and I) barely kept in contact with him. There were no disagreements, fights etc. He didn't cut us off, but never made any attempts to keep in contact and always rejected any invitations for family meals etc. He only hinted a few times that his wife didn't like our family too much. The only time we saw his kid in person was out at a shopping mall by chance.

&#x200B;

So over the past few years, my mum's health has worsened, requiring surgery and extra care. I got my folks to move in myself and my wife as it would be easier on them, along with getting professional care services in the daytime. I've always updated my brother from time to time about the situation but he has never visited in person and has only sent the odd fruit basket here and there.

  
Recently, I shared with my parents that we were looking to sell our current house to finance an upgrade to a bigger house in a better area. My dad stopped me and said there was no need to as they were able to finance that as they were selling off some properties they had (my parents were not wealthy. They were middle class folks who bought some properties while they were dirt cheap). My parents spoke abit about their plans and said that my brother would be receiving half too.  


I honestly got pissed off and questioned their decision given his utter lack of existence in the past 20 years. My parents said that at the end of the day, he is still their son and it is only fair to do so. I said that by giving him half, I'm put at a disadvantage to him given what I had done over the past few years. I told them that I didn't care about about his half of the inheritance and asked them to consider donating his half away.   


I found it extremely insulting to be at the end of the day, valued the same as my brother. One could say value goes beyond monetary items but I feel that action speaks louder than words. My wife chided me for being so confrontational about it, but idk man, this feels ridiculous.

2113,ywfob3,AITA for laughing at my husband's discomfort after he got mad at me for buying the wrong peppers.,laughing at my husbands discomfort after he got mad at me for buying the wrong peppers,"Dear AITA I never thought it would happen to me but I just got called an asshole by my husband so I am bringing it to you to judge.  

I do all the grocery shopping for my house.  My husband and I share all our finances and chores but he works long hours and so I take on the groceries because I like comparing prices and budgeting.  My husband likes to cook and will sometimes request certain things so he can make a special meal he wants.  

He wanted to make Thai chili lime shrimp. He asked me to pick up the hot chilies like you get at a Thai restaurant.  The grocery store didn't have any of those little ones but they did have the ones labeled as hot Thai chilies that were bright red but about the size of a jalapeno. 

He got really upset that I hadn't bought the right ones and that his meal wasn't going to turn out well.  I know he had a tough day so I said I would make sure I got the proper ones the next time I saw them. It was just a silly disagreement with no bitterness or anything. Just a little disappointment on his part.  

He still made the meal.  Including chopping up the chilies.  

After he was done prepping he needed to use the bathroom.  And he scratched his balls.  

Well let me tell you. The peppers had plenty of heat to them after all.  He is sitting on the edge of the tub with the hand held shower blasting cold water at his scrotum.  And every time he tries to stop he has to sit right back down and shoot more cold water at them. 

So I giggled. And he heard me. And then he called me an asshole for laughing at him. 

He also laughed at himself and apologized for saying I got the wrong chilies. Then he called me all sorts of names but I think he is just venting about his balls. 

But I do feel sort of bad for laughing.

2117,yw727z,AITA for telling my coworker no?,telling my coworker no,"Disclaimer: This is my first time posting, so apologies for any mistakes. I'm very new to Reddit.

I (27m) used to work at a popular local coffee shop. I quit a few years ago to pursue other passions, but recently came back. Previously, I had a great friendship with my coworkers and our regular customers. I love to talk with our regulars, it's one of my favourite parts of the day. Makes me feel like life is a movie.

Now that you're all caught up, I'll introduce the problem. While I was gone, a girl who we'll call Marie (fake name, 16f) joined.

No problem with that. She's sweet, and everyone treats her as if she was their younger sister or daughter- even the customers. She just gets on my nerves because it's like she *knows* that everyone loves her.

Now, Marie is allergic to nuts and freaks out when hazelnut syrup gets on her. She refuses to make drinks with almond or soy milk/acts all sad when customers bring doughnuts because she can't have them. I think she's being dramatic, but then again, I don't have any food allerges.

Anyways, we were pretty busy last Friday after school, my girlfriend came in to study, and I took her order. Marie was the only one making drinks because we were short-staffed and the other barista was on break, but she's an experienced barista at this point, and should've been fine. The only other employee was wearing a headset and taking orders through the window.

I was having a nice talk with my girlfriend when Marie came up to me and asked if she could take care of the rest of the line while I swapped her and made the drinks. I asked her why and she said it was because three of them had either hazelnut syrup or almond milk in them.

Here's where I may have been the AH:

Obviously, I told her no. and to just go get some gloves on and make them. I told her that she would be fine, because she would. She's not going to have a reaction just because she touches a tiny bit of it. If she was, why would she be working here? I'm allergic to cobalt, but you don't see me complaining about not having a tattoo.

She went and asked the coworker on headsets to trade before proceeding to tell him what I told her. They traded, and he came over to me to tell me I was an AH and needed to apologise.

My girlfriend told me that what I did was perfectly acceptable. I think what I did is perfectly fine. Marie needed to know that the world wasn't gonna change for her just because she has an allergy. But word spreads fast through shifts and all of my coworkers say otherwise. I'm starting to feel like I might have overreacted.

So, AITA?

2128,ywj2sp,AITA for attempting to psychoanalyze my sister?,attempting to psychoanalyze my sister,"a bit of background info: my sister (f20) absolutely does not want children, I (f17) do. This is a well established fact in our family and has never been a cause of tension, especially between the two of us. My sister also loves watching videos of animals, especially cats. I tease her about it lovingly since I think it's really cute, and it's basically an inside joke between us at this point.

Two weeks ago I made the observation that the extent to which she adores and fusses over cats is similar to the maternal instinct that most women feel for babies. It was a casual remark, not meant to be taken too seriously, but I must have struck a nerve because she yells at me about how she doesn't want kids and how she'll never change her mind, to which I'm like ""..ok?"". And then she shouts ""Why do you never apologize for the awful things you say? You never apologize, ever. And you know what, that's probably why you don't have any friends."" Then she ran upstairs to her room and slammed the door shut.

This came as a shock to me, since I can honestly say that I've never, as far back as I remember, said anything to her with the intention of hurting her, and she has never once (again, as far back as I remember) expressed hurt at something I said.

It's been two weeks since that happened and she hasn't spoken to me at all, even though we live together. She won't even look at me. aita?

edit: I wanted to clarify that I hardly bring up her decision to not have children, since like I said, it's an established fact in our family and I obviously have no reason to judge her for it.

2133,ywq3lh,AITA for not inviting my child free sister to a family day at my house.,not inviting my child free sister to a family day at my house,"I 38M have three kids with my beautiful wife. My extended family does not get together too often because everyone is older and busy. All of my cousins have children except for my sister who is married but “child free”.

My wife and I decided to invite all the cousins and their kids over also aunt and uncles so all the kids/grandparents can have a nice day and everyone can be together and all the kids can bond. It was an event meant for parents. 

My wife suggested not inviting my sister because she hates kids so much and never want to be around or help out with our. I agreed we have asked her more times then I can count to watch the kids overnight or for a weekend to give my wife and I a break but she always declines so we figured she would decline this too and did not extend an invite.

When everyone was over they kept asking where she was and I told them the truth. One cousin tried to claim that my sister doesn’t hate kids and she comes over and helps her with her kids all the time and has been a life saver with her newborn. She also claims my sister is her kids favorite aunt. Not my experience with my sister getting her babysit for our kids is like pulling teeth she always has something  better to do. 

I told them at the end of the day it’s my and my wife choice who we invite to our house. This soured the mood and things got awkward and most everyone left early.

2136,ywrqnu,AITA for choosing this hill to die on?,choosing this hill to die on,"I'm(27F) getting married to my boyfriend(31M) of 5 years. He is also a family friend so we knew eachother since we were very young. I have a niece(F17) who lost her parents when she was 10 and my parents took care of her after that and I helped them so we are very close and she is like a daughter to me. My boyfriend hated my brother(niece's dad) who was not a nice person(he bullied my boyfriend very badly when we were younger) however my niece loved him a lot. The other day I don't remember what we were talking about but my boyfriend said some harsh things about my brother and my niece heard him. She yelled at him and said some hurtful thing to him and I ended the argument by sending my niece to her room and asking my boyfriend to leave and I thought it would be the end of it since neither of them talked about it again

A few days ago I asked my niece to be my MOH in my wedding and she lashed out on me and told me she won't even attend my boyfriend's wedding let alone being a MOH. I told my boyfriend that he needs to apologize and convince her to be my moh but he said he won't apologize and doesn't care if she is my moh or not. I got angry and told him that he'd better start caring about my niece or we are done and told him to call me when he decided to apologize to her and not bother calling me before that.

His parents called me tonight and called me an asshole for choosing this hill to die on

Our friends were all on our side regarding the matter, but we wanted to get a more objective standpoint on our actions which is why we reached out to this sub.

The original post is in the comments.

Edit: 

Hi all, thanks for all the responses. We wanted to address a few of the frequent comments:

1) yes, we acknowledge we left after the closing time mentioned in the agreement. We agree that this wouldn’t have happened in the first place had we had better time management. However, has there never been a time you mismanaged your time incorrectly? Or ever a time you ran a few minutes late to something? We don’t thjnk we’re particularly assholes for that. In regards to us “blatantly being disrespectful” for doing so, other members in this community are also doing the exact same thing — one member who works FOR the studio once said “I do this all the time” when we stayed after asking if he needed help. While other’s behavior don’t excuse us of our behavior, it sets the tone that this deadline was a soft kind of deadline, especially since we didn’t know of the severity of leaving late. We’re not the only members apparently being “disrespectful.” We see others in the dark after the lights close, but they are able to leave a few seconds right before the alarm rings. (For reference, we have no clue when the alarm rings, we believe it is around 5 minutes after 10?) We have also never been egregious with how late we leave. I can tell you that we start cleaning up before 10. We never intend to stay after 10, it just happened. To all those that mentioned “what gets me is their inability to do both cleaning and leaving on time,” our point was that if we had known and were put in a difficult situation where we didn’t manage our time correctly, we would just leave the space and come back the next day to clean up so that we do not cause any financial damages to the business. We are not purposely letting this alarm ring. 

2) we didn’t know it was so commonplace for businesses to have alarms that call the police. The alarm ended up ringing right as we took the last few steps to leave the studio the first time, and ended ringing shortly after. We both thought this to be some personal alarm, we honestly never knew about these false alarm charges until our email exchange with the owner. Our point was that, had we known about the severe consequences, we would have taken this a lot more seriously, as opposed to thinking it was more of a soft closing time (especially as other members in the community leave really late, and we never knew about the financial consequences). That brings us to intent. We’re not trying to be assholes who leave late. 

3) intent (please read the other bullet points before this) - the community is something the studio stresses on. They mention, “if there’s a mess, just clean it up even if you didn’t do it. If the water is dirty in the buckets, replace it, we should act like a community when using this space.” Given that the closing time seemed like a soft closing time, and that others leave messes too, we decide “ok let’s clean up after them too.” We are trying to be members of the community, to all those that said “clean up ur shit and leave by 10” — yes that this the ideal scenario, and we definitely would have made sure of it if we had known we would be charged a fee. We also read some of the penal code for trespassing in California, and 1) we were never told to leave 2) we entered legally 3) we did not “occupy the space” nor did we enter the property to hinder business activity. He can see on the video footage that we are rushing to clean up and leave. We think given this, we have a case to explain why we’re not criminally trespassing. We also do not take his accusation lightly. 

Last few things:
- we are led to believe this has happened before us. The city only charges $250 after the 5th occurrence in the calendar year, and the owner mentioned this is the first time anyone has disputed paying the fee. Given that he is charging us $250 (meaning this happens often), we do believe that he should reflect on how to onboard members into the studio and to make this consequence clear in the guidelines.  

- clock: some mentioned that the clock running 5 minutes late is no excuse. We agree this is a weak excuse, but the clock only started running late the week that this happened twice (we guess someone had changed the time after day light savings). We didn’t know it was running late, and if anyone has done this type of art form, you would know your hands get really messy and you’re often not on your phone. Heck, often times my phone is dead. Sure, am I mess for my phone being dead? Yes, but am I TA? I personally didn’t think so when we initially wrote this post. Yes we could’ve set an alarm on our phones, but we didn’t know the clock was wrong. We also note that we’ve been members for HALF A YEAR at this point, and we haven’t been part of any issues until this past week. 

- we are offering to pay half. Sure, we rang the first alarm unknowingly, we didn’t know it had any repercussions other than possibly making him upset, but then we found out about the severity of the issue and we agree to this charge. However, we think him “not having the time to notify us the first time” is not our fault, and that his negligence in having the clock wrong also justifies why we don’t feel “100% responsible” (as he claims). We think for the second alarm, he has some responsibility there. He had over a day in between to tell us about the invoice. These occurrences did not happen back to back days.

In the end, thanks for taking the time to read all of this, and given that some people believe we are TA, we have realized our wrong way of thinking and will pay the fee.",edit thank you for all the

2143,ywt5rw,AITA for how I handled my wife’s birthday?,how i handled my wife’s birthday,"I (m42) I work a job where it’s possible, and usually happens a few times a week, that I could be at work until 7/8/9:00 at night, it depends on what job I’m assigned that day. A couple weeks ago after two weeks straight of 8/9:00 days my wife asked me if I was doing ok with this and said maybe I should talk to my boss about the frequency of the late nights, (we’re short people right now) I told her I was fine with the OT money and I’d rather keep working them knowing that if I need out on time any day I just have to tell them and it’s not a problem, they schedule me a lighter day. 

My wife’s (39f) birthday was last week. I took her out for dinner on Saturday and our kids and I made her dinner Sunday. The morning of her birthday I told her I had a job that would probably mean a late night. She got upset that I hadn’t told my boss I needed to leave on time that day since it was her birthday, bringing up the specific conversation about how I said I could ask for that any time I needed. I said that taking her to dinner and making her dinner over the weekend was all I planned to do and I didn’t think I needed to leave on time that day. Usually the kids have activities at night and she’s not home anyway. It ended up that I got home at 6:30 but by then she had already left to take our 4 kids out for dinner. 

Additional info before it’s asked- she also works full time and since she’s home she is the one who makes dinner and runs the kids to their activities, I help with that the days I’m home on time 

She says I hurt her feelings by not doing a simple thing to prioritize her actual birthday I said she’s overreacting because I already did something days before.

I know its her house too but I wish she would give us guy time and go to another room when I am over. When he comes to visit my parents and me he always brings her you get the point. He always busy with work the kid or her.

Before their kid they always used to go to this beer expo that is held a few times a year.

He called me up later and told me that they were in and he purchased tickets for the three of us. I was pissed I thought it would just be the two of us and assumed his wife would stay home with the kid so he could have a day off. I told him as much. He told me sorry but him and his wife haven't has a fun day out in forever and our mother agreed to take their kid for the day and overnight and they were looking forward to it. He also said this beer expo was always something they would do together and they have been going together for years just the two of them before they started inviting the big group so its kind of their thing.

2157,ywyzn8,AITA for spending $800 for concert tickets on behalf of my friends when they told me their hard limit was $300?,spending for concert tickets on behalf of my friends when they told me their hard limit was,"EDIT: I want to clarify that my friends wanted lower bowl seats (NOT nosebleeds) for $300. They thought the prices would be that range because of previous concerts from 4+ years ago even though I was skeptical since Taylor’s become much more popular. Taylor announced nosebleeds would be $50 and floor $500 which is why they believed this. I was under a lot of pressure to either get the nosebleeds for several times what they wanted or the lower bowl for also much more, I made a quick decision under pressure. I also want to repeat that I spent only my own money and they DO NOT have to buy the tickets from me if they don’t want to. If you check resell sites right now they could still get the worst seats for $300 but they don’t want to. I’m not a miracle worker, I can’t deliver both quality of seats and price.

I (30F) have a friend group of 6 people, and we’re all Taylor Swift fans. Of course, we’re all planning to go to her concert, but I was the only one to get a verified fan presale code, which means only I could buy tickets. Luckily they limit purchases to 6 a person, so I was tasked with buying all the tickets and getting my friends to pay me back.

Before sales were opened, we discussed how much money we were willing to spend. There’s a decently large income discrepancy in the group, as I and another friend have high paying ($100k+) jobs while the others work in retail/serving or are in school. Two of us (me included) were willing to pay up to the thousands while the others didn’t want to spend more than $100 to $200. I convinced them that there’s no way in hell we could get decent tickets for that price We negotiated and settled on a hard cap of $300.

Day of the presale it was a shitshow. I could literally see seats going unavailable in real time, and the website was displaying higher prices than expected. It was impossible to get anything other than nosebleed seats for under $300. I made the executive decision to get 6 lower bowl (not floor but closer to stage than upper) tickets that came out to $800 a person after fees.

I told my friends what had happened and apologized for the price, but it was really get these tickets or none. Very soon after I checked out the shows in our location were completely sold out. Four of my friends are extremely upset with me, ranting that they agreed on $300. One went so far as to insist she would only pay me that much and demanded I cover the $500 difference and give her the ticket. I tried to be apologetic but they said some nasty things and I told them they could go to hell.

It would be easy to sell these tickets for face value, especially since online scalpers have pumped the prices up to $1k+ already. I’m not worried about losing money and I told them so. My friend with the good job and I fully intend on going and having a good time regardless of what the other 4 decide. However, they’ve been posting on social media and publicly dragging us, and some other friends are also calling me TA.

2162,ywvw22,AITA for going off on my cousin after she locked the keys in the car?,going off on my cousin after she locked the keys in the car,"My cousin {18F} and my aunt {38F} have been with us for the past 2 weeks while they’re on vacation, they are visiting and  here resides my brother {40M} my pregnant girlfriend {19F} and myself {22M}. 

Yesterday, my cousin Mariah {18F} locked my brother’s keys into the car. I became extremely upset since it was 40• outside and it was raining. Although my girlfriend and I both had coats, we could’ve gotten sick and we were still very cold. We asked her to go into the car to start it up and warm it up until we came downstairs, 5 minutes later we come downstairs and she was outside trying to open the doors, and I asked her what she was doing. She explained that she locked the keys into the car and I said “what the fuck!” I lightly moved her away from me and tried opening the doors for at least 10 minutes. During this time I was getting increasingly upset because I cannot understand how a grown woman can be so clueless as to how to lock **keys** into a car I told her to start.

2167,yx48sc,AITA For not agreeing to an alcohol-free Thanksgiving,not agreeing to an alcoholfree thanksgiving,"My wife and I are hosting her family for Thanksgiving this year.  In total, we are expecting 15 people for dinner, but 6 of them are staying with us for a couple nights.  Two of my wife's family members are in recovery for alcoholism.  Her uncle has been sober for almost 6 years.  But one of her cousins from a different uncle has only recently started his recovery.  He was in treatment for a couple months and finished that maybe 2-3 months ago.  Everything I've heard is that he's doing much better and hasn't had any setbacks.  Her cousin and his mom are 2 of the people staying with us.

My wife's mom and aunt (cousin's mom) told my wife that we should make sure there is no alcohol for Thanksgiving.  Not asked, told.  My wife apparently agreed without discussing it with me.  She only told me about this plan this past weekend.  We were out shopping and stopped at a liquor store and I mentioned getting a few things for Thanksgiving.  She said she ""forgot"" to tell me, but we are having an alcohol-free Thanksgiving.  

When I asked why, she explained about her family members in recovery and that her mom and aunt think we should do this out of ""solidarity"" with them.  I told her that I understand that, but I also don't necessarily agree with forcing everyone else to change for 2 people.  She said that I can make this sacrifice for a few days and that it's not that big of a deal.  

I am the one who is going to be doing most of the cooking.  Neither my wife nor anyone in her family is great in the kitchen. My wife is OK as a sous chef if I need her to be, but that's about it.  When I cook, I like to enjoy a glass of wine, a beer, or a cocktail.  Especially if I'm going to be in the kitchen for a long time cooking a huge meal for over a dozen people.  

I told her that if she wants me to cook an entire Thanksgiving dinner for her family, then I should be able to dictate how I cook that meal, including having a drink while I do it.  She thinks that her request for a dry Thanksgiving is entirely reasonable and that I'm making this into a big deal when it doesn't have to be.  

It's not like I'm going to start drinking at 9am, nor do I intend on getting drunk.  But I'm going to be spending a lot of hours in the kitchen and I want to be able to cook the way I enjoy cooking.  I would even be ok without having a drink with dinner, but this compromise is not acceptable to my wife. It has to be 100% alcohol free.  

I understand wanting to make sure that her family members feel comfortable, especially her cousin since this is so new for him.  But this is my house too and I'm going to be the one doing the majority of the heavy lifting.  I don't feel like me having a few drinks in my own home while I'm cooking a huge meal is too much to ask.

Yes, I know it's only a few days and not drinking during that time is not going to kill me.  But I also feel like if I'm going to be spending hours cooking for these people, me having a few drinks would be a reasonable concession.",my wife and i are hosting her family for thanksgiving this year in total we are expecting people for dinner but of them are staying with us for a couple nights two of my wifes family members are in recovery for alcoholism her uncle has been sober for almost years but one of her cousins from a different uncle has only recently started his recovery he was in treatment for a couple months and finished that maybe months ago everything ive heard is that hes doing much better and hasnt had any setbacks her cousin and his mom are of the people staying with us my wifes mom and aunt cousins mom told my wife that we should make sure there is no alcohol for thanksgiving not asked told my wife apparently agreed without discussing it with me she only told me about this plan this past weekend we were out shopping and stopped at a liquor store and i mentioned getting a few things for thanksgiving she said she forgot to tell me but we are having an alcoholfree thanksgiving when i asked why she explained about her family members in recovery and that her mom and aunt think we should do this out of solidarity with them i told her that i understand that but i also dont necessarily agree with forcing everyone else to change for people she said that i can make this sacrifice for a few days and that its not that big of a deal i am the one who is going to be doing most of the cooking neither my wife nor anyone in her family is great in the kitchen my wife is ok as a sous chef if i need her to be but thats about it when i cook i like to enjoy a glass of wine a beer or a cocktail especially if im going to be in the kitchen for a long time cooking a huge meal for over a dozen people i told her that if she wants me to cook an entire thanksgiving dinner for her family then i should be able to dictate how i cook that meal including having a drink while i do it she thinks that her request for a dry thanksgiving is entirely reasonable and that im making this into a big deal when it doesnt have to be its not like im going to start drinking at am nor do i intend on getting drunk but im going to be spending a lot of hours in the kitchen and i want to be able to cook the way i enjoy cooking i would even be ok without having a drink with dinner but this compromise is not acceptable to my wife it has to be alcohol free i understand wanting to make sure that her family members feel comfortable especially her cousin since this is so new for him but this is my house too and im going to be the one doing the majority of the heavy lifting i dont feel like me having a few drinks in my own home while im cooking a huge meal is too much to ask yes i know its only a few days and not drinking during that time is not going to kill me but i also feel like if im going to be spending hours cooking for these people me having a few drinks would be a reasonable concession,579,NAH

2177,yx3cle,AITA for saying my girlfriend thinks she knows better than culinary professionals and expressing my disapproval?,saying my girlfriend thinks she knows better than culinary professionals and expressing my disapproval,"I (26M) live with my girlfriend (27F) of four years, and we try to split all grocery shopping and cooking duties equally. We both like cooking well enough and pay for subscriptions to several recipe websites (epicurious, nytimes) and consider it an investment because sometimes there's really creative stuff there. Especially since we've had to cut back on food spending recently and eating out often isn't viable, it's nice to have some decent options if we're feeling in the mood for something better than usual. (I make it sound like we're snobs but we eat box macaroni like once a week)

Because we work different hours, even though we're both WFH we almost never cook together, so I didn't find out until recently that she makes tweaks to basically every recipe she cooks. I had a suspicion for a while that she did this because I would use the same recipe to make something she did previously, and it would turn out noticeably different, but I brushed it off as her having more experience than me. But last week I had vet's day off on a day she always had off, and we decided to cook together because the chance to do it doesn't come up often. I like to have the recipe on my tablet, and while I was prepping stuff I kept noticing how she'd do things out of order or make substitutions for no reason and barely even glanced at the recipe.

It got to the point I was concerned she was going off the rails, so I would try to gently point out when she'd do things like put in red pepper when the recipe doesn't call for it or twice the salt. She dismissed it saying that we both prefer spicier food or that the recipe didn't call for enough salt to make it taste good because they were trying to make it look healthier for the nutrition section (???). It's not like I think her food tastes bad/too salty but i genuinely don't understand what the point of the recipe is or paying for the subs is if she's going to just make stuff up, and there's always a chance she's going to ruin it and waste food if she changes something. I got annoyed and said that the recipe was written with what it has for a reason, and she said she knows what we like (like I don't?), so I said she didn't know better than the professional chefs who make the recipes we use (& neither do I obviously)

She got really offended and said i always ""did this"" and when I asked what ""this"" was she said I also got mad at her once because she'd make all the bits left over after cooking into weird frankenstein meals. I barely remembered this until she brought up that time she made parm grilled cheese and I wouldn't even eat it (she mixed tomato paste, parm, & a bit of mayo to make a cheese filling because it was all we had.. yeah I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole even though she claimed it tasted good). She called me ""stiff"" and closed minded so I said i didn't get why she couldn't follow directions, even kids can follow a recipe, and it's been almost a week and we're both still sore about it.",i m live with my girlfriend f of four years and we try to split all grocery shopping and cooking duties equally we both like cooking well enough and pay for subscriptions to several recipe websites epicurious nytimes and consider it an investment because sometimes theres really creative stuff there especially since weve had to cut back on food spending recently and eating out often isnt viable its nice to have some decent options if were feeling in the mood for something better than usual i make it sound like were snobs but we eat box macaroni like once a week because we work different hours even though were both wfh we almost never cook together so i didnt find out until recently that she makes tweaks to basically every recipe she cooks i had a suspicion for a while that she did this because i would use the same recipe to make something she did previously and it would turn out noticeably different but i brushed it off as her having more experience than me but last week i had vets day off on a day she always had off and we decided to cook together because the chance to do it doesnt come up often i like to have the recipe on my tablet and while i was prepping stuff i kept noticing how shed do things out of order or make substitutions for no reason and barely even glanced at the recipe it got to the point i was concerned she was going off the rails so i would try to gently point out when shed do things like put in red pepper when the recipe doesnt call for it or twice the salt she dismissed it saying that we both prefer spicier food or that the recipe didnt call for enough salt to make it taste good because they were trying to make it look healthier for the nutrition section its not like i think her food tastes badtoo salty but i genuinely dont understand what the point of the recipe is or paying for the subs is if shes going to just make stuff up and theres always a chance shes going to ruin it and waste food if she changes something i got annoyed and said that the recipe was written with what it has for a reason and she said she knows what we like like i dont so i said she didnt know better than the professional chefs who make the recipes we use neither do i obviously she got really offended and said i always did this and when i asked what this was she said i also got mad at her once because shed make all the bits left over after cooking into weird frankenstein meals i barely remembered this until she brought up that time she made parm grilled cheese and i wouldnt even eat it she mixed tomato paste parm a bit of mayo to make a cheese filling because it was all we had yeah i wouldnt touch that with a ten foot pole even though she claimed it tasted good she called me stiff and closed minded so i said i didnt get why she couldnt follow directions even kids can follow a recipe and its been almost a week and were both still sore about it,561,YTA
2180,yx5idv,AITA for agreeing with her ex and not my sister?,agreeing with her ex and not my sister,"As a kid, I always looked up to my older sis because she was so cool, pretty, and the popular girl. I always tried to be like her, dressed like her, listen to her music, you get the idea. I was popular the 1st time I stepped through the HS door because I was basically a copy of her. I was overwhelmed by the attention but quickly found out she was mostly popular with only the guys. She “dated” many of the guys in our HS and they thought I would too. I was so embarrassed, I had our mom take me out to buy new clothes and everything. Whatever she did, I went the opposite way. She wore tons of makeup, I wore none. She listened to a certain type of music, I didn’t. We went to different colleges.

Fast forward to now. Sis must have figured out her lifestyle wasn’t healthy so she stopped “dating” a bunch of men, deleted all of those apps, and met Sam. He’s very good looking with a great personality and amazing job. He was smart, funny, outgoing, and can own the entire room when he walks in. He grew up in a different city so his family doesn’t live here but we’ve met and they’re amazing just like him. Sam quickly replaced us as mom’s favorite child and became our dad’s best friend. He eventually proposed and everyone was over the moon. I was very happy for sis.

Last week she came to my door looking like a complete wreck. She was crying so hard she couldn’t talk. After an hour or so, I calmed her down enough to get the story. Apparently they were at a party and was mingling separately when he over heard some guys talking about her popularity. Sam joined the group and got her “dating” history. 2 of the guys in that group “dated” her and about 4 other guys at that party did too, 1 of whom works with him (which is why they were there). He heard about the guys laughing about how all the men in the town were depressed when she went away to college but rejoiced when she came back. When they got home, he asked her, she told him the truth, and he left without saying a word.

I helped sis and she’s been staying with me for now. She hasn’t told anyone and have been trying to get in touch with Sam and his family but they’re all ignoring her. Everyone on our side is super confused because Sam just disappeared. Our cousin (my best friend) pinned me down the other day to ask what happened. I told her and she was appalled. She called him all sorts of names and insecure. I said I can understand from his view as we live in a small town and it’s hard to know many men and your coworkers “know” your future wife. Then my cousin and I got into it. She said I should be supporting my sis no matter what. I argued I am supporting her but supporting doesn’t mean I have to agree with her.

Now I might lose my best friend.

2183,yx77r4,AITA for using scented lotion even though it gives my roommate a headache?,using scented lotion even though it gives my roommate a headache,"My college roommate is ""allergic"" to fragrance. She says she's allergic, but when you ask clarifying questions like, ""Oh, have you been tested?"" she'll say that she's not actually allergic, it just gives her a headache sometimes.

When I found this out, I was kind of sad, because I love perfume and scented lotion and all kinds of stuff like that. But, to be considerate, I never spray perfume or put on lotion when she's in the room.

The other day, I took a shower in the communal bathroom on our floor. I put a scented lotion on in the bathroom when I was done. It was not a heavy scent. I came back into the room, and she made a big deal of gagging and leaving the room.

A few minutes later, she came back into the room and told me that I can never do that again. I replied back that I have already compromised by never spraying perfume or putting on lotion when she's in the room, and that is enough. She threw a little hissy fit, and she brings it up to our friends (who are all on my side, they smelled the lotion, it really isn't strong) whenever she can.

So, am I the asshole for refusing to stop?

Edit for more info:
I also have fragrance sensitivities to heavy fragrances, so I do not own any. Unlike her, I am actually diagnosed. Some of my friends who smelled it also have fragrance sensitivities. Roommate has several friends who smoke cigarettes, I have an allergy to cigarette smoke, I deal with the headaches when she comes back smelling like smoke because it's her space, too, she can't cater to my every desire. I think she should do the same thing on the rare occasion that I have to take a shower when she's in the room.

Edit two:
I am accepting my place as the asshole. I will get an unscented lotion and use that when she's in the room.

I (29M) had a kid with my ex-wife (32F) 10 years ago, my daughter. And there’s no real way to sugarcoat this but as soon as she was born, I left and I never ended up seeing her in the hospital as a baby. Was never really present in her life at any point but ended up getting a divorce 11 months later with her getting full custody of course. I married young, was really stupid and thought I’d end up being a good dad despite no skills but got scared that I’d turn out like my dad and chickened out. Not really an excuse but an explanation I guess. I paid child support for the first 3 years but stopped afterwards.

I’ve been speaking with the girl’s mother about reconnecting with her, but she thinks it’s best that I stay out of their lives majorly. But I think making amends is always possible so I’m not sure, I just really want to make things right but I will respect their decision. I’ve seen her a few times but her mother has always introduced me as a friend. She says she will tell her when she is ready. 

I’ve been dating a girl (28F) for about 10 months, and I really like her. I think I could definitely see a life for us and I know that sounds weird but she’s also said the same. I was also speaking to my daughter’s mother about meeting this girl, but she says absolutely not and that’s a bad idea. But if I want to reintroduce her into my life isn’t it fair that she gets to see my life too?

It was horrible and took a toll on everyone, but obviously my wife more than anything. They were very close, pretty much best friends. We knew it was coming and the illness took over our lives, which is to be expected. I also knew my wife would struggle when she finally did pass so I tried to convince her to go to therapy but she’s refused.

We have two older children (13 and 6) and this year, she gave birth to our youngest. This is the only grandchild my MIL never got to meet. The whole pregnancy was very bittersweet and my wife kept saying “I wish mom was here, I wish mom could meet him, etc”. Again, to be expected.

But the issue has come up that even before our son was born, every event went back to her mom. At first I understood but in time, it’s become like we have this cloud hanging over us, preventing us from fully enjoying happy moments. I’ve tried talking to my wife about it, gently but she gets super defensive and refuses to even talk about therapy.

Our eldest turned 13 over the weekend. She had spoken to her mom privately and said she’d really like for their to be no talk of her grandmother. She wanted to have a happy celebration and not get sad that her grandmother isn’t there. My wife agreed.

We went out to dinner and everything was fine. Towards the end, we had cake. My wife said “it’s just so sad that grandma can’t be here! She’d be so proud of who (eldest) has turned out to be! I wish she could be here!”

Our eldest got mad. She blew out her candles but didn’t speak the rest of the dinner. When we got home, I spoke to my wife privately and said what she did wasn’t fair. I said she could’ve excused herself if she was that emotional, but she honestly didn’t seem to be. I told her that this can’t continue to happen. She told me that wasn’t fair.

2192,yx948r,AITA for giving my daughter's phone away to my son as punishment for something terrible she did to him?,giving my daughters phone away to my son as punishment for something terrible she did to him,"Burner for obvious reasons, but my daughter (15) did a really crappy thing and posted a picture of my son (12) and writing “Roast Me” under it. It was in a private group message but apparently it was screenshotted and ultimately got back to him and his friends in the middle school due to a friend’s sibling. It earned him a shitty new nickname and some very avoidable teasing.

He doesn’t have a phone because we have a “No phone until you’re 13 rule.” He turns 13 in a little less than two months. We took away my daughter’s phone until after the New Year. This lines up with the fact that my son will be getting a new iPhone for his birthday.

In my anger, I said that I was giving my son the phone that my daughter was no longer allowed to use. By the time she gets it back, he will have his own. He’s only allowed to use it in the house.  I know it was petty, but I was so damn upset that I just kind of blurted it out. My wife said that I went too far and that it will only lead to resentment between the two.

2195,yxcped,AITA for telling my wife that her investing losses are not my problem?,telling my wife that her investing losses are not my problem,"I (30m) come from a very poor family, but my wife is from a very rich one. She started off the marriage with a net worth of 31 million dollars, and I started it off with 300k dollars in student debt.

When we got married, she made me get a prenup that separated her inheritance and got rid of my right to an ""elective share"" to it if she dies. In other words, I renounced my spousal right to a third of her separate property if she dies, making her sole beneficiaries her siblings or potential children. My debt and our incomes were also separated. We both got lawyers -- hers much more expensive than mine -- and notarized the prenup.

None of this was a problem for me -- as a man, I'm determined to pull myself up by the bootstraps, not rely on my wife's wealth for anything. The only beneficial part of the prenup for me was that our incomes were also now separate, and I earned a somewhat higher income than her, and so I was okay with it overall.

Five years later, I still don't have a seventh of her current wealth, but her investments haven't been doing great this year either.

As a sole crypto investor, things have been going very poorly for her. I had warned her not to do this, but she invests in a cryptocurrency called ""Monero,"" which is down 47 percent this year. About 5 percent of her money was not in her wallet and was in the FTX exchange itself, which she lost after FTX went bankrupt recently. She now has a net worth of around 18 million dollars.

I don't invest in crypto, but rather in index funds. They've taken a hit this year as well, but based on historical performance, they should go back up eventually. No such guarantee for cryptocurrencies, and certainly not for Monero.

I came home to her crying the other day after she found out that FTX went bankrupt. I told her ""that's rough"" -- not in a sarcastic way -- and I went upstairs to change.

When I got back downstairs, she started bitching and complaining, talking about how ""nonchalant"" I was being about her losing money. I pointed out that she's still extraordinarily rich in spite of her poor choices and that she could stop investing in crypto at any time if she wanted to. Besides, she was the one that wanted to separate everything, so why does she want to make it my problem all of a sudden?

Me (F.) and My ex husband (M.) are divorced. We have a 16 yo son together ""Mason"". I got remarried to my husband (M.) Nathan.


My ex husband and I used to argue on who should get Mason for the holidays back when he was little. As he got older we started letting him decide. Last year he spend Christmas with me, Nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was ""terrible"" because he said Nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (I'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods Mason eats). He also said he didn't feel as welcom as the other kids in the family and that Nathan forced him to share his personal stuff like his phone so that his stepnephews could watch christmas movies.


Yesterday, during breakfast we were talking about christmas and what we were planning this year but hem out of nowhere announced that he'll be spending this Christmas with his dad at a rental christmas cottage in his favorite town. I was stunned, so was Nathan. I asked Mason when and how he agreed to this arrangement but he pointed back to what happened last christmas and said he didn't want to basically ""have another shitty holiday and be miserable"" I told him that his dad should've come to me first but he argued that he's already okayed it and so he saw no need for my opinion. We started arguing and he started complaining about me trying to ruin the experience but in response I told him that he has already ruined christmas for me and his stepdad the minhte he agreed to this arrangement. He got up and walked away after saying that I was being ""overdramatic"". Nathan just sat there and looked down.


I had a huge argument on the phone with Mason's dad and he kept giving me an attitude and laughjng and saying that I sounded pathetic. When I told him I'd have my lawyer call him, he bbackpaddeled and said he woukdn't have done this if Mason didn't like it. He urged me to drop it and let Mason have this experience or he'll resent me for missing it. Now Mason isn't speaking to me. Nathan is trying to convince him to stay with us because without him, our christmas is ruined but he won't budge from the looks of it.

2243,yxuu45,AITA for telling my parents to pick between me and my sister for the Hollidays?,telling my parents to pick between me and my sister for the hollidays,"I (28M) am currently pretty much estranged from my family. I have a younger sister (27F) Tory. When one of my friends Brendan (28M) started dating Tory, I hated it at first but eventually I gained a best friend. They got married in 2018 and I was the best man. Brendan is now like my brother, we are that close. In 2020 Tory left Brendan for another guy. Reality Tv type shit. My parents were incredibly upset, as was I. My sister moved in with the guy immediately. My parents knew I was pissed but had to “support” their daughter. I went NC with Tory and LC with my parents.

In 2020 when Tory’s second wedding happened, I didn’t go. Me and my dad had it out over it. My mother tried playing peacekeeper for the family. My parents then started giving me the silent treatment. When 2020 Holliday season came around it was the height of Covid. My parents said that I should just do my own thing this year. Because with me going out a lot, they didn’t want me spreading diseases. My exact response was “if you are worried about catching diseases from other people. Shouldn’t you be more worried about Tory. I mean she’s the one who likes to sleep around”. Me and my dad had another fight especially due to his “family over everything mantra”. 

I hardly spoke to my family in 2021. My parents would send me text like  “when you are ready to apologize” we’ll be here type shit. I responded with a Bible verse about adultery and how they support it. I was berated again and we hardly spoke until October of 2021. Last year I was told we were doing thanksgiving at Tory’s place and if I wanted to come I needed to apologize to Tory and her husband. I laughed and ended up going to Brendan’s family’s. Where Brendan’s mom posted me with her family on FB and tagged me with a quote about “family being those you choose”. I never told her to post it. But my mom saw it and went apeshit. Asking for me to come over and talk and even commented on the post. 

So this year my plan is to go to Brendan’s family again. My mom called and said she wanted to host this year. I asked if Tory and her husband would be there. She said of course they are family. I said “so was Brendan, but I saw how you treated him and me. So no thank you”. Yesterday my dad called and said my mom is distraught and has been for years. She wants us all to get along, so I need to do the right thing. I said I’ll come if my sister isn’t invited. He said that he wouldn't do that to family. I said he did that to me for 2 years. He claimed I did it to myself. My mom is now saying it was my dad that has been the hardass about this the whole time. I said she should have divorced him then because I’m not putting up with his shit anymore. Either my sister isn’t invited or I don’t come. 

I’ve now had some extended family reach out and say my parents are upset and hurt. I said my parents were totally okay with not having me around for 2 years. AITA?

Edit: for those responding and wondering. Yes she did cheat. Brendan found the text. She never came clean or admitted it. Brendan was willing to forgive and work past it. She left in the middle of the night and moved in with the new guy. And took the house and he had to sell it (he had it before they married) so when I say being held “accountable” I think she owes him money on top of everything else.

2253,yxzmyy,AITA for taking back my dresser from my stepdaughter?,taking back my dresser from my stepdaughter,"F30 
When I first married my husband (M36) and moved in with him I decided to give my stepdaughter my old dresser and nightstand from my parents house. My set was much nicer and she loved it so we got rid of her old dresser during the move. 

It’s been about 4 years now and my husband and I have a 2 year old daughter and are expecting another girl in February. We have been co-sleeping with our daughter since she was born and she has shared our room, but now we need to move her into her own room. I have always wanted my children to have my old things from my childhood and that included the dresser set. When we gave my stepdaughter the dresser I had made it clear to my husband that once we had children OUR children would be using it since it is mine. He agreed and still agrees with me so we decided to discuss it with my stepdaughter. 

She was upset that we were taking it away, we tried to ask her to downsize her things so that she can store her clothes in the closet but she refused saying we should just buy a new dresser for our daughter. So after she left we decided to leave her clothes on her bed and take the dresser out ourselves. After she came back the next weekend she waited until we left the house and moved the dresser back into her room. My husband had another discussion with her and we let her know that was unacceptable. 

Now her mother is involved and is calling us telling us we are being unreasonable and should just buy and new set. The thing is my husband and I have also decided to stop buying new clothes for my stepdaughter as we already send her mother child support and we need both the money and space. Once she grows out of her clothes she will not need a dresser so there is no point in buying a new one when we need to save money. 

TLDR: I am taking back my dresser that I gave to her a few years ago so that my daughter can have it and she is refusing to let us have it back

Update: my stepdaughter is 13 and no we did not tell her beforehand that it was a loan but it was expected of her to give it back if we asked as we are the adults and the parents

I don’t think it’s wrong to ask her to bring clothes from her mothers as she only visits every other weekend

Update2: after reading the overwhelmingly negative comments I can understand now why my actions might seem selfish. As you read there were other things that we wanted to give my children from my childhood and some of those things were my old toys which I also gave to my stepdaughter. She had no issues giving up those toys for her sisters to have them so I assumed it would be the same for the dressers. We have given it some thought and have decided to let her keep the dressers until she outgrows them and we will just buy a new one for the other girls to share.I honestly didn’t think this would blow up like it did over such a small issue.",f when i first married my husband m and moved in with him i decided to give my stepdaughter my old dresser and nightstand from my parents house my set was much nicer and she loved it so we got rid of her old dresser during the move it’s been about years now and my husband and i have a year old daughter and are expecting another girl in february we have been cosleeping with our daughter since she was born and she has shared our room but now we need to move her into her own room i have always wanted my children to have my old things from my childhood and that included the dresser set when we gave my stepdaughter the dresser i had made it clear to my husband that once we had children our children would be using it since it is mine he agreed and still agrees with me so we decided to discuss it with my stepdaughter she was upset that we were taking it away we tried to ask her to downsize her things so that she can store her clothes in the closet but she refused saying we should just buy a new dresser for our daughter so after she left we decided to leave her clothes on her bed and take the dresser out ourselves after she came back the next weekend she waited until we left the house and moved the dresser back into her room my husband had another discussion with her and we let her know that was unacceptable now her mother is involved and is calling us telling us we are being unreasonable and should just buy and new set the thing is my husband and i have also decided to stop buying new clothes for my stepdaughter as we already send her mother child support and we need both the money and space once she grows out of her clothes she will not need a dresser so there is no point in buying a new one when we need to save money tldr i am taking back my dresser that i gave to her a few years ago so that my daughter can have it and she is refusing to let us have it back update my stepdaughter is and no we did not tell her beforehand that it was a loan but it was expected of her to give it back if we asked as we are the adults and the parents i don’t think it’s wrong to ask her to bring clothes from her mothers as she only visits every other weekend update after reading the overwhelmingly negative comments i can understand now why my actions might seem selfish as you read there were other things that we wanted to give my children from my childhood and some of those things were my old toys which i also gave to my stepdaughter she had no issues giving up those toys for her sisters to have them so i assumed it would be the same for the dressers we have given it some thought and have decided to let her keep the dressers until she outgrows them and we will just buy a new one for the other girls to sharei honestly didn’t think this would blow up like it did over such a small issue,562,YTA

One of our middle kids (26F) and her husband (20 something? M) are in the process of buying their second house. Their first one sold quickly and the new owners offered extra for a quick possession. They don't get possession of they new place until January 1st, they had to leave their place November 1st.

&#x200B;

They had planned on getting an Air BnB, but my wife and I have an apartment over our garage and offered them that space. 

&#x200B;

Things had been going really well, they both work so they went about life. My wife loves to cook for more than one person, so they've been eating dinner with us most nights. That part has been wonderful, its been so nice having my daughter around in the evenings. 

&#x200B;

The other night after they had gone back to the apartment I went to get something from the garage. The apartment can be accessed from the outside, and the inside, there is a staircase inside the garage, and only an interior door separating the garage from the apartment. I could hear them, very obviously having sex. I felt it was a bit disrespectful to be having sex when they are staying with her parents. I thought I had raised her better than that.

&#x200B;

I told my wife, and she laughed, she said and I quote ""good for them"". I couldnt let it go, so the next night at dinner I brought up how disrespectful we find it for them to be having sex in our home. My wife did not back me up, she made sure to tell them it wasn't ""we"" but only me who felt that way. My daughter and her husband excused themselves from the meal. I expected an apology, but instead they moved out the next day. 

&#x200B;

My wife says they are a married couple, and aren't even in our house, that I was an AH. But in my mind they are staying in an apartment on our property they could at least abstain until they don't live with us. I would never dream of disrespecting my parents having sex in their house.

Last week we went on our third date and then we came back to my place. She was supposed to stay the night. We had some wine and she got drunk very quick with just two glasses. It was also late so she started falling asleep but she kept the conversation going. 


At some point she asked a question about my political opinions, which made me uncomfortable, but I answered honestly and she said she ""wasn't going to allow politics to drive a wedge between [her] and [her] love"". 


I was pretty stunned as I didn't know she felt that way about me and I felt that it was too early to talk about “love”, but this wasn’t the time or place to have a discussion about this so I let it slide. 
Later she got up to use the bathroom but accidentally spilled what was left of her wine on my carpet. It really pissed me off because my carpet is not new but still looked good. She apologized and offered to clean it up, and I admit I told her to pack her shit and leave. 


She looked confused and offers to clean up the carpet again, but I told her to just leave. She said it was 2am and she was too drunk to drive, but I said I would call the cops to have her removed from my property if she didn't leave immediately. So she did. 


The next morning her car was still there but she wasn't in it. When I came home from work, it was gone.


Yesterday my best friend and his wife came over and asked about the stain on the carpet. I told them what happened and they called me an asshole.

2265,yy2tbv,AITA for not letting my son go to Korean barbecue with family because of the way he treats his younger brother?,not letting my son go to korean barbecue with family because of the way he treats his younger brother,"I'm a mother of two sons, one is 9 and another is 15. They fight like cats and dogs and it makes me so stressed and tired. I literally have hair falling out over it. My older son always claims the younger one starts it, but the older one keeps it going. If only he would learn to BE THE OLDER ONE AND IGNORE THE YOUNGER ONE and realize that the 9 year old is just trying to get a rise out of him, and he'll stop when the older one doesn't give him that reaction. But my 15 year old doesn't want to realize this, so every time he reacts, he gets punished for it. I've had to take away his hard-earned phone and computer countless times because getting him where it hurts is the only way he'll learn. And he makes it so hard to punish my younger son when the older one does it himself and makes himself the one in the wrong, invalidating any punishment for the younger one.

The reason why we punish the older one is because due to him being on the spectrum, we’ve had to consult many books and professionals who agree that it is something we need to help him overcome as much as possible so that he can be as successful as he can in the world and not let it ruin things for him, so when he misbehaves we emulate those consequences at home in order to prepare him. Plus, I really can’t punish my younger son; he’s my adopted nephew who was born several weeks early due to his mom having substance abuse issues, and he has a severe learning disability which he can’t outgrow, so I have to be soft on him, and my older son needs to do that as well.
 
Yesterday I had family over in the car coming back from a day trip and we were going to go to Korean barbecue as a family. My 9 year old tried teasing my 15 year old about ""the weird anime stuff he watches"" (I didn't know this) and the older one proceeded to flip out and call my 9 year old names and wish death on him. I just decided I had it, I'm dropping off my 15 year old off and he will not go to Korean BBQ with family, he can have whatever leftovers at home.

He then began to cry and refused to get out of the car when we got home, but I said I wouldn't drive away until he left. I then had to threaten to take away his computer and phone for a month if he didn't comply and he begrudgingly got out of the car.

I was then subject to a 20 minute long rant about how my 15 year old son hates me and wishes I were dead because I ""favor his brother and make him miserable"" (NOT true, I love them equally) and that I need to learn to ""control my crotch goblin"" (I was shocked when he said this"" and a bunch of other rhetoric, and ended it with him saying that if we don't change our ways, he would disown us when he gets older.

He's refused to talk to me since then and has told relatives about what happened, with some taking my side and others taking his. I tried sitting down with my son telling him about how much I love him but he told me to F off and ""get on birth control"" and I'm just crushed. What did I do to deserve this?

My wife is a stay at home mom. I work from home 3 days a week. It's good because I can help out with the kids and give my wife a break. I leave the door to my office open 80% of the time. I have explained to my wife multiple times that when my door is shut I am in a meeting and I cannot help and I need her to not interrupt me.

She keeps opening the door to see if I need anything, or to let the kids in to see me, or to take out the garbage. I wait until after my meeting and then I tell her again that if my door is closed I NEED her to leave me alone and keep the kids away from me. She just cant keep it in her head. **I told her that I was going to get a lock for the office if she could not understand what it meant when the door is closed. She said I was being mean to her and treating her like a child and that I did not need to lock her out of the office.**

I have plants in my office that I take care of so I have a spray bottle that I keep for misting them. So last week I was in a meeting and she came in again to see if I needed anything from the store because she was going grocery shopping with her mom. I asked her politely to close the door because I was in a meeting. She said sorry and closed the door.  My meeting had just finished and she opened the door again. So I sprayed her. She shut the door. Then she called me an asshole for treating her like a misbehaving animal. I asked her if she understood what it meant when my door was closed. She shut up and left with her mom.

So before I get dogpiled I will clear some stuff up. I work 40 hours a week. I might have my door closed for 8 of those. So on the weekends we take care of everything together. Monday through Friday there are only 8 hours where I need to be left alone. My children know better than to open the door when it is closed. But she just does not get it.

So now I am at the point where I have given her a choice. I can start spraying her on camera during my meetings, I can get a lock for my door, or I can just go into work in town every day. If I do the last one it means she is stuck in the house all day with the kids because we only have the one car.

I am at my wits end and I feel like an asshole for treating her this way but I do not want to get fired or forced to work at the workplace because I cannot have meetings when I work from home.

My ex and I sometimes will go see Tate before or after school regardless of who is picking him up or dropping him off. He likes seeing both of us together.

I went to see Tate before his mom picked him up (she has him this week) and he wasn't there. I thought that was strange because usually my ex would come after me. I felt a bit dumbfounded and then alarmed when they showed me the signature of the person who signed him out. Tate has ASD but you would not noticed.

I couldn't get ahold of my dumbass ex and I began to wonder if something happened to her too. 

Finally a yard aide told me that my ex's husband ""Ted"" picked him up. I thought that was odd. I texted him and asked him if my kid was with him and he posted a picture of my son eating ice cream.

I told him that I was at his school. Ted said that Tate is still with them and he wanted to spend time with him. He didn't think he needed to ask permission. But everything was fine.

I called him and said everything was not fine. It doesn't matter whether Tate is staying with  me or my ex. He needs to ask me if it's okay to pick him up. Personally I wouldn't have cared if Ted took him out for ice cream. It's not a trust issue. He literally had to help bathe him when he broke his leg this summer. 

He said that he'd let me know next time something like this happens but he's not going to ask me for permission if Tate is staying with them and if Mom has no problem with it.

Edit: My wife WOULD run it by my ex if it's okay to pick up my son if my ex was expecting my son to be at school",im divorced and remarried as is my ex my ex and i share an yo boy tate and an yo nicky my ex and i sometimes will go see tate before or after school regardless of who is picking him up or dropping him off he likes seeing both of us together i went to see tate before his mom picked him up she has him this week and he wasnt there i thought that was strange because usually my ex would come after me i felt a bit dumbfounded and then alarmed when they showed me the signature of the person who signed him out tate has asd but you would not noticed i couldnt get ahold of my dumbass ex and i began to wonder if something happened to her too finally a yard aide told me that my exs husband ted picked him up i thought that was odd i texted him and asked him if my kid was with him and he posted a picture of my son eating ice cream i told him that i was at his school ted said that tate is still with them and he wanted to spend time with him he didnt think he needed to ask permission but everything was fine i called him and said everything was not fine it doesnt matter whether tate is staying with me or my ex he needs to ask me if its okay to pick him up personally i wouldnt have cared if ted took him out for ice cream its not a trust issue he literally had to help bathe him when he broke his leg this summer he said that hed let me know next time something like this happens but hes not going to ask me for permission if tate is staying with them and if mom has no problem with it edit my wife would run it by my ex if its okay to pick up my son if my ex was expecting my son to be at school,341,YTA

We have always been close.

I am not interested in a relationship right now and have been hooking up with girls. 

I bring a girl home often after I go out drinking. My sister works but she never said anything until recently. 

The next morning after a girl left, my sister told me how she was kind of uncomfortable with all these girls “she doesn’t know” coming over. I told her no problem. 

The next time when I had a girl come over I knocked on her bedroom door and introduced the girl I was with to her. She didn’t really say anything and we both went back to my room. I did this 2-3 times with different girls. 

The next morning after the third, my sister started yelling at me and the girl I was with quietly left. 

My sister yelled at me and said I needed to stop and I was embarrassing her in her own house. 

Normally I would just dismiss what she was saying as sibling fights but she really seemed angry with me.

2277,yy7x01,AITA for telling my wife she can’t join me on a trip to meet my online friend?,telling my wife she can’t join me on a trip to meet my online friend,"I started streaming gaming content on Twitch about a year and a half ago as a hobby and have since grown a decent following. I'm not at the point where I can make an actual living off of it and probably never will be, but honestly I'm content with where I'm at. It still feels like an escape that I sometimes get paid for rather than a job, and I think if it ever switched into 'job' territory, I might bow out pretty quickly.

Over the course of my time on the platform, I've made a few friends. I clicked with one in particular, a 28 year old man who we'll call Vex, and it's been great getting to bond with him over our shared interests. We play together outside of my streaming times and we exchanged birthday gifts this year. He lives in another country and after lots of planning and some saving up, I'm going to visit him at the beginning of December.

Up until this point, my wife had never really had much of a problem with any of my hobbies or me talking to people online. Even when I mentioned meeting Vex in person, she would never say anything that would let me know she was against the idea. But the closer the trip gets, the more she's been bringing up wanting to go. I thought she was joking at first, but a few nights ago she basically sat me down and said she either wants to come with me or she doesn't want me going at all. I pointed out that this isn't some weekend trip - I'm planning on staying for two and a half weeks - and that I would be spending a majority of my time with Vex. She struggles to get time off work as it is, much less that long on such short notice. I hated the thought of her taking time off for a trip she wouldn't enjoy and might even have to leave early from (and she hates flying alone).

Ever since I shut down her ultimatum, she's been scoffing at me every single time I mentioned Vex, Twitch, or gaming in general. I need some outside perspective.

We get along great and I love almost everything about him except for his selfishness. In our times together, I’ve never seen him give anything to any cause even though he makes good money.

 We’ve been to the grocery stores together many times and when the cashiers ask if he wants to donate, he always said no. One time we got into an argument because the cashier asked if I wanted to donate $1 to a children hospital and he said no. Who doesn’t donate to the children hospital?!? Whenever we are stop at a red light, he never gives anything to the people at the corner asking for money. Never, not once.

Recently a friend of mine got pregnant and her boyfriend bailed. Her parents said she’s old enough to figure things out for herself so they’re not helping her. She’s 25 but they’re still AH for that. Anyway, I threw her a baby shower because I know she’ll need things as a single mother. Jack came and brought literally the cheapest thing on the registry, a bag of diapers. I was disappointed in him as I previously told him it’d be nice if he got her the bugaboo stroller or the clek car seat, you know, something she really needs. We got into an argument about that too.

I was at his house the other day when he got a package in. He opened it and showed me it was a new bottle of cologne and had me smell it. Although it smelled fantastic, I was speechless when I saw the invoice. He paid $450 for a bottle of cologne when all he bought for my friend was a bag of diapers. I saw red and went off on him.

I know I’m the better person and right but my sister is telling me I was being too harsh because he can spend his money anyway he wants to. I said told her he can do better.

When she came over early last Saturday to help prepare with me, i disclosed to her information that one would assume is private. I told her that i was hallucinating bugs in my bedroom in the last couple of days and that i would jerk up from my sleep in the middle of the night.  She told me that ”it seemed serious & i should get checked up before it escalates”.

I ignored it and told her to just forget about it. We talked about things that have been on our minds as of recently. We were having a wholesome time preparing this dinner party for our friends and family.

Skip to when the dinner party begins, we greet everyone, do our usual conversing and after an hour, we all sit to eat. After we all talk about recent thoughts and affairs, my sister announces that “i’m going crazy” jokingly whilst she was wine drunk. My mother asked her what she meant and i made signals to her to stop speaking. She progressed and said “Rebecca is seeing things that aren’t there and she can’t sleep without jumping out of her sleep” and laughs it off.

I leave my seat after everyone stares at me, completely embarrassed and i can hear from the hallway that my sister is talking about how i always take everything seriously and that i need to loosen up. I go back in and tell her to “get out of my house or i‘ll escort you out”. She, of course, thought i was kidding. I grabbed her arm and she willingly walked with me until i was at the door and i told her to leave. She again informed me that she didn’t know i wouldn’t want others to know. I told her to go and she finally listened.

It was completely awkward for the rest of the party and i avoided my mother. The next day, my mother EMAILS me a psychiatrist’s information. My sister has been messaging me, claiming that it was an accident and she would never intend to hurt me. My relatives have all been asking me if i’m okay. I feel embarrassed.

We have always called our future children by the names we chose, even before we were pregnant we would refer to our future baby as either Olivia or another boys name we have picked.

My sister in law was pregnant at the same time but much further along. Mid-way through her pregnancy she was discussing a list of potential names and Olivia popped up. We had always kept it secret so my partner reached out and let her know that’s the name we have picked for our child if it’s a girl, and if not this pregnancy we intend on another and if they are a girl it would be Olivia then. 

Fast forward to after her baby girl is born and they still haven’t picked a name. She told us a list of options and Olivia was still on there. She said to me ‘I’m sorry if we pick it, I know it’s on your list’ to which I replied ‘it’s not on our list, it’s the name we have locked in and our only option.’ 
A few days later and they announced her name, if you haven’t guessed, it was in fact Olivia, which they had nick named ‘Oli.’ 

She initially text my partner her announcement to which he replied ‘you know that’s our name and we still intend on using it.’

2306,yyhk4m,WIBTA My Wife wants more time for herself when all she has to do is take care of our Child.,wibta my wife wants more time for herself when all she has to do is take care of our child,"Me(27M) and my wife(25f) have a 6 month old child. Before we had the child we agreed that she would be primarily in charge of childcare, while I would do practically everything else. This includes 95% of chores and other housework, I am the only one between the two of us that works a job(Night Shift Security Guard), I make dinner for the family, etc.   


I want to clarify some things before I get INFO'd in the comments. When I say I do 95% of the chores, I mean that my wife will do some of the dishes like the babies bottles or cups when they need to be washed and I am asleep during the day, and occasionally fold a load of laundry that she needed a piece of clothing from before I can get around to it. I vacuum and mop the floors, do the laundry, the dishes, clean the bathrooms, cook dinner and do the grocery shopping. She takes our child to doctors appointments, wakes up with them during the night(on the days I am at work), watches them during the day, and will make baby specific meals(She will puree vegetables and fruit, and cut up smaller portions of chicken).   


I do spend as much time as I can with our child. I wake them up in the mornings when I come home from work and feed them breakfast before I sleep. When I wake up I'll try to play with them for about 30 minutes, doing reading and playing with whatever toy they're interested in for the week. During the weekends when I am awake during the night I will be the one who gets up with our child.  


This is coming to a head because as we were eating dinner before I went to work, she asked if there was any way that I could watch our child more due to her feeling like she needs time for herself. At first I thought that she wanted to have more weekend events with her friends while I watch our child during the day, something I am more than okay with and have agreed with multiple times. Instead she was asking that I sleep less during the days that I work so that she can have breaks from the child during the day. I told her that I would think about it at work and I want to say no. I understand that being a SAHM is stressful because you always have to watch the baby, but she doesn't do any chores and from the way things were phrased she wouldn't be willing to take up any chores during the new break I would be giving her. I don't have much time to myself either, but I do understand that she carries the stresses of watching our child most of the time while I don't.

2333,yym9xo,AITA For Ringing Neighbors Door Bell at Midnight Because They Are Blocking the Sidewalk and Threatening to Call Police?,ringing neighbors door bell at midnight because they are blocking the sidewalk and threatening to call police,"I was walking my dog right before bed and it was around midnight. One of the houses I go past has one of their cars parked directly over the side walk to the point where you have to walk in the snow to get around it. Like this is the worst parking I've ever seen, I drew a little diagram showing it: [https://imgur.com/a/E1UmrNu](https://imgur.com/a/E1UmrNu)

I decided that since this person was inconveniencing everyone in the neighborhood who wants to use the side walk, I didn't care that I would be inconveniencing him by ringing at this hour. The conversation went like this:

Me: Hi, just wanted to let you know your car is blocking the side walk.

Him: Oh, that's not my car, it's my buddies.

Me: Oh ok, is there some way you can move it? It's completely blocking the side walk.

Him: What are you, with the city or something?

Me: No, I'm just out walking my dog and saw you were blocking the side walk.

Him: So you ring my door bell at midnight just to tell me I'm blocking the side walk?

Me: Yea, you can just move it or I can just call the police and they'll give you a ticket.

Him: Hmm, well why don't you just get the fuck off my property you fucking dumbass.

Me: Ha, that's cute, ok then see ya, have a nice night.

I tell my wife about it when I get home and she thinks I was an asshole because it was too late to ring their doorbell and it's not that big of deal, but it's winter and you have to walk in the snow to get past the car. Some context, this is a completely empty residential street so it's not a big deal to walk on the road if needed and I didn't actually call the police to report it since I've never seen them park like that before. I just want to know if I'm justified doing so next time.

Note: The lights were on all throughout the house, it wasn't like the house was totally dark.  


EDIT: To clear up some things:  
\- It's illegal to park on sidewalks here and during the winter months they ban street parking over night so lots of people will park sideways on the space between road and sidewalk, this person just did a HORRIBLE job of it.  
\- This is a small Canadian town, people aren't answering their doors with guns like all the Americans here are afraid of.  
\- We get our sidewalks cleared by the city with these mini plows, however there hasn't been any snow for a couple days now.  
\- Those saying if I actually cared about others I would have called the police, I figured they would have just given a ticket, in which case that doesn't help those who would use the sidewalk in the morning. It would have been in everyone's best interest if he would have just moved it so the obstacle was immediately cleared and then would also be saved from a potential ticket.

2335,yyp553,AITA for spraying perfume straight towards my coworker who refuses to shower?,spraying perfume straight towards my coworker who refuses to shower,"So, basically there is this guy, and he smells of sweat really bad. It gets worse from monday to friday, because the smell intensifies and on wednesday its already so bad, I want to puke and it makes my head hurt. 

Now, he's been told by people about it. He didn't believe anyone telling him that. One time he brought his t-shirt to another coworker and asked her if she can smell anything because he can't. That's ridiculous, but whatever. He's been told many many many times, and usually when he is told he smells really bad, a week after you can't smell him, because he might be putting effort into showering, but it doesn't last long. And at this point my manager said, she doesn't want to make him feel bad enough so he wouldn't leave, since we're short on people. 

And I am really sorry for him, he's probably super depressed and can't even shower, which happens. He's a good guy, always friendly and never mean or anything. But holy fuck, I can't suffer it. Imagine coming at work all happy and ready to start a day and then you're hit with this terrible stench, it always ruins my day instantly. 

So anyway, whenever he works closer to me, I literally just spray perfume towards him, I don't even try to be subtle about it anymore, because I really can't take much of it. And I was told by another coworker I'm being an asshole about it. I don't see it really, but maybe I am?


Edit : I want to clarify that I do not spray anything ON him, but more towards his side. For example, he can be 5 meters away, and I just spray it in the air, but towards where he is.

Edit2: Everyone in my work place use some kind of spray just because of him, no one is bothered by it, no one ever complained about that. But people are doing it more subtle, whenever he's not watching. I did the same for a long time, but at this point I'm just done caring about how he feels, I do it whenever I can't bear it anymore, just spray the air towards him.



Edit3 : Thanks for everyone taking their time to say something. I took few advices and I ordered some things to help me more than what I was doing before. To all the people trying to insult me, I think you could find a better way to spend your time than that. To all the people that been helpful, thank you. I learned its really not nice of me, and I will be more open about how I feel, and pressure the HR to do something about it or I will change my job.

2344,yyriv3,AITA for demanding my son’s teacher starts giving homework and reporting her because she is being dismissive of me?,demanding my son’s teacher starts giving homework and reporting her because she is being dismissive of me,"My husband, my son (m14) and I (f36) moved to Europe in August because of my husband’s work. My son attends international school to ease his transition. His classes are in English but he has to follow national curriculum of our new country.

He’s been struggling a lot because they have to learn a lot more subjects than he is used to.

One of the subjects he struggles with is math. He doesn’t get to choose whether he wants algebra or trigonometry, he must take math and they’ll cover all parts of it. Kids are also far ahead of him. Things he’s learned at school last year, they covered 2 years prior. It’s been a struggle. He was offered to attend a lower grade to help catch him up but we refused

Now, here’s the issue, his teacher doesn’t give them homework. She said that they cover topics and excel uses in classes and then, they have their worksheet in the book. She told them, it’s optional but if they want to do well, they should do them to practice what they’ve learned.

My son, Nathaniel (Nate) saw this as no homework and haven’t been doing it sati there’s no homework and it’s not graded. As a result he’s been failing his tests.

I see the issue and went to the teacher asking her to give them homework to help him structure his study better and to grade it so he can get some good grades to help with his final grade.

She refused and said that the goal was to teach kids how to study independently, that some kids will only need to do 5 equations while others will need 25 and she wasn’t going to force kids to do it if they don’t need it. She said she wasn’t going to grade homework because tests are enough to understand were the students are with their abilities.

I told her that she was being dismissive and called her unprofessional and bad at her job.

She told me to leave. I was furious, it was disrespectful and dismissive. I went straight to her superiors and reported her. 

It’s been a few days and nothing has been done. I feel completely dismissed and vented to one of my new friends and they told me I was entitled and an asshole and I’ll admit, I am completely shocked. I thought they would be on my side.

2346,yyrzf9,AITA for telling my girlfriend that she can’t speak Japanese to my parents during thanksgiving.,telling my girlfriend that she can’t speak japanese to my parents during thanksgiving,"I (M35) have met my girlfriend (F30) at work (we’re both interpreters). We’ve been together for a few months and thanksgiving will be the first time she’s going to meet my parents.

I am half Japanese, my dad is Japanese my mother is American. My mother learned Japanese so she can connect with my paternal side of the family. Me and my siblings all speak Japanese. However, none of my siblings spouses do.

My girlfriend, Sasha, started learning Japanese before it got popular, she started learning it when she was 14, has both, BA and MA in Japanese and Translation & Interpreting. She sounds as close to a native speaker as possible. 

However, I wanted her that she shouldn’t try and speak Japanese when meeting my parents or grandparents and that she’s forbidden from using it even when I’m usi it with my siblings. 

She asked why and I told her that I’d hate for my Sils and Bills to be uncomfortable because they don’t speak it and I don’t want her to become my parents/grandparents favorite because we’ve only been together a few months and it wouldn’t be fair if they liked her more than my sil of 10 years who doesn’t speak Japanese.

She said that’s ridiculous and she shouldn’t have to hide it. I said that perhaps later when we’ve been together for longer.

She asked if she had to pretend not to understand me and my siblings when we talk. And I said, exactly. She got really weird and went home. She’s been kind of distant lately and I told a friend about this and they said that I was a major AH and if they ask her about her job, she’s have to lie as well. I admit, I hadn’t thought of that.

Thanksgiving is coming and it's too soon after the conflict for me to be comfortable around him. WIBTA for opting out this year, or offering to celebrate with just my parents on another day?**

My brother and I are 8 years apart, I’m older.  Since he was about 12 I have lived in another state.  We aren’t close, but we hang out a few times a year and it’s easy and fun.  I recently moved to the same city as he and my parents.  I envisioned us getting closer but it never really happened.  He’s the king of “I’ll call you tomorrow” with zero follow-up.  It hurts my feelings, but I’ve accepted it and take what I can get.    

He got married this past September.  I was told that there was no wedding party because his wife’s family is too big for her to make a choice and she didn’t want to leave people out.  I was given instructions to get a gray suit and that I’d be given a blue tie for pictures. 

The day of the wedding I was hanging out in the mens’ dressing room and I saw that my brother has a gold tie.  And that his best friend has a gold tie.  And that his old bandmate has a gold tie.  Odd, but I didn’t think too much of it.  

The ceremony started and I was sitting in the audience.  Lo and behold, the music starts and there’s a procession.  My brother’s two gold-tie friends walk in and line up on stage left, and his wife’s sister and her husband walk in and line up on stage right.  The nonexistent wedding party.  At this point I have an almost out-of-body experience.  The ceremony was a blur.  After the ceremony we “took pictures” which means I took one picture with my brother and that was it.  I spent the cocktail hour in a stall in the bathroom, embarrassed and hurt.  

I made it through dinner ok, and instead of cake my brother had made a ton of his specialty cookies for dessert.  I’m allergic to the recipe as-is, but with a simple tweak I can have them.  He didn’t make any for me, or even warn me this was happening so I could bring my own dessert.  Anyways, I left the second dancing started.  And a week later sent the newlyweds a letter saying basically “I thought things would improve once I moved here, but this wedding has shown me that we don’t have a relationship outside holidays at mom and dad’s house, so let’s just keep it real and I will see you there, being disappointed all the time isn’t healthy for either of us”.  

The problem is that Thanksgiving is upon us, and not only will they be at my parents’ house but they are bringing a couple of friends with them, so I will be really outnumbered and uncomfortable.

She's been at our small company (we have 9 employees) which my husband and I own for 6 almost 7 years.  Every holiday season we have our holiday lunch at a either a steak house or a fancy restaurant during work hours.  For the first few years Holly came to the party (but she's very antisocial and did not eat much or seem to be enjoying herself).  But for the last 2 years Holly has refused to come.  Last year I told her that if she didn't come that I wouldn't be giving her the yearly bonus check that we present to everyone and she still refused to come. I asked her directly why not, and she bluntly said that she can't stand to eat with us, and that 2 of the employees smack their food and speak while eating, and she can't stomach sitting at a table with them for 2 hours.  

While I agreed that I did notice the bad table manners, I felt that it was extremely rude to not come so I said okay and let her stay behind and did not give her a bonus that year.  This year, I once again asked Holly if she was coming so I could plan the reservation and she again said no.  So I said okay. 

Yesterday my husband was helping me put the holiday cards together (where we put the bonus checks in) and asked where Holly's was, and I told him that she's not coming so she isn't getting one and he blew up at me.  He says since Holly has been there so long and is one of our best employee's that we should just give her one anyways, but I still refuse to.  I think if she can't sit and eat a meal with us for 2 hours (even though it's on the clock and we're paying her to) then she shouldn't get one.  If anyone is wondering, hers would be $500.

Everything is good, she has some weird eating habits that have never really impacted our relationship;

She’ll order a burger, and then just eat the middle part 

We will  cook pasta, and instead of sauce she’ll either have it plain or have ketchup on it, once she had beans.

All her meals are just bland, she will not have spice.
 
We will have salmon and she’ll mash the salmon up with mayonnaise 

She’ll eat shredded cheese in a sandwich, won’t eat cheese if it’s in like a block shape 

She’ll eat Mac n cheese, but only Kraft or Cheeto Mac n cheese, anything homemade or doesn’t taste like cheap plastic cheese she doesn’t like 

She will eat food that is on her plate, even if she doesn’t like it or she’s full; she once accidentally got orange chocolate cake (orange chocolate makes her sick) and ate the entire slice because “waste not want not” whatever that means

She usually does the cooking but we’ve got my family around, I’m not cooking two separate meals for like 9 people so I cooked the pasta then just dumped it in the sauce - one night not going to make a difference?

I asked her how it was and she just shrugged and said “I thought you knew my preferences by now”

It was one night, but I guess it would’ve been easy to set some pasta aside I just didn’t think one night would be a massive deal? If it were an allergy or intolerance I would’ve 1000% considered it

She’s not that upset with me, but keeps joking we can’t have family over anymore because then I may just forget I’m in a relationship again 

AITA? She’s got no intolerances etc, just preferences.

My mom has some issues and my wife has zero patience. I'm not even talking about typical controlling MIL stuff, but more like personal issues. My mom is extremely weird about certain things such as eating, touching people/things, having control over what she wears/ her body. 

She isnt great with social norms and to be honest people do coddle her. My grandparents are just burnt out from raising her and don't even care at this point, and her husband is just happy as long as she is eating enough and doesn't care how bizarrely she behaves.

I don't believe in coddling her, but also feel my wife is controlling sometimes. I believe in giving my mom two choices with one being she can leave or opt out. For example if she wouldn't wear the color my wife picked for our wedding, she could just not be in pictures. If she is being rude and refusing to eat, she can leave the room. However i don't see the point in fighting with her. You are never going to win. 

We recently had a Christening for our son and my mom showed up in a strapless dress which is not allowed in my wife's family's church. My mom has never been to a church in her life and didn't think that was still a rule. To be clear this wasn't some clubbing dress and would have been fine if her shoulders were covered at all. 

My wife told her she can't go in like that and offered her MIL's sweater. My mom refused as it didn't match her dress and she didn't like it. she looked around for something else to wear and then offered to go home and join us for the party later. i thought that was fine but my wife got mad and said she was being selfish and acting like an idiot and demanded she put it on. My mom said no and started whining. My wife accused her of not loving her son/grandson and it became a power struggle. People (not my mom) started yelling at my wife. it was awful. 

I told my wife to leave her alone and said my mom could put it on or leave, but leaving is a perfectly valid option. My wife just gave me a death stare. My mom said she would leave and thanked me for being reasonable which I see was a dig on her part. Eventually my dad gave her a suit jacket and I thought everything was fine, but my wife was furious after the fact and said I sided with my mom and let her ruin our son's christening. She said I'm a coward and should have demanded she put that sweater on, and it is ridiculous that she cared more about the sweater than her family. she said I undermined and embarrassed her in front of everyone, and my mom deserved to be yelled at.",my mom and my wife have never had a great relationship my mom has some issues and my wife has zero patience im not even talking about typical controlling mil stuff but more like personal issues my mom is extremely weird about certain things such as eating touching peoplethings having control over what she wears her body she isnt great with social norms and to be honest people do coddle her my grandparents are just burnt out from raising her and dont even care at this point and her husband is just happy as long as she is eating enough and doesnt care how bizarrely she behaves i dont believe in coddling her but also feel my wife is controlling sometimes i believe in giving my mom two choices with one being she can leave or opt out for example if she wouldnt wear the color my wife picked for our wedding she could just not be in pictures if she is being rude and refusing to eat she can leave the room however i dont see the point in fighting with her you are never going to win we recently had a christening for our son and my mom showed up in a strapless dress which is not allowed in my wifes familys church my mom has never been to a church in her life and didnt think that was still a rule to be clear this wasnt some clubbing dress and would have been fine if her shoulders were covered at all my wife told her she cant go in like that and offered her mils sweater my mom refused as it didnt match her dress and she didnt like it she looked around for something else to wear and then offered to go home and join us for the party later i thought that was fine but my wife got mad and said she was being selfish and acting like an idiot and demanded she put it on my mom said no and started whining my wife accused her of not loving her songrandson and it became a power struggle people not my mom started yelling at my wife it was awful i told my wife to leave her alone and said my mom could put it on or leave but leaving is a perfectly valid option my wife just gave me a death stare my mom said she would leave and thanked me for being reasonable which i see was a dig on her part eventually my dad gave her a suit jacket and i thought everything was fine but my wife was furious after the fact and said i sided with my mom and let her ruin our sons christening she said im a coward and should have demanded she put that sweater on and it is ridiculous that she cared more about the sweater than her family she said i undermined and embarrassed her in front of everyone and my mom deserved to be yelled at,502,ESH
2369,yyxxlj,AITA for telling my wife I don't think she should be a SAHM?,telling my wife i dont think she should be a sahm,"I (M30s) live with my wife (F30s) and our two kids (M7 and F3).

My wife and I both have full-time jobs. Our eldest is in public school 5 days a week and our youngest is in daycare 3 days a week. My wife and I work around each other's schedules. When it comes to housework, I do all the cleaning and laundry as my wife really hates those tasks, and I also do all the cooking. My wife does the grocery shopping.

My job recently offered me a promotion. If I accepted it, I would have a significant increase in pay. The issue is that my job would become a lot more stressful, and I'd have to work more hours. This wouldn't be doable with our current household setup.

I talked to my wife about it and she suggested that she quit her job and become a SAHM. She seemed really eager. 

The issue is that I really don't think my wife is cut out to be a SAHM and I think she would hate it after a few weeks. She hates cleaning, she hates cooking, and she loves her current job. I also think my wife has an idealistic view of being a SAHM. She keeps telling me about how easy her life will be and how she'll be so productive.

I asked my wife if she would really enjoy it, considering that she'd have to do more housework than she currently does. She insists that she wouldn't mind. I told my wife I think it would be better if I turned down my promotion and we carried on as we are. She told me to stop being ridiculous and that she'd make a great SAHM and that it would be good for the kids.

2379,yz06gu,"AITA for not wanting to see the man who’s life I saved, ever again",not wanting to see the man who’s life i saved ever again,"Context : Last summer, my mom had some construction work done at our house since she was working in another country. I (20F) went back home for the summer break. There were 2 men working there.

One day I was reorganising some papers when I heard someone screaming for help outside of the house. 
I ran down the stairs to go outside and there I saw one of the construction workers on his back not able to move on the stairs made of stones in the garden. 

He basically fell right on his head on the hard stairs and was heavily bleeding. In that moment my brain froze and my body took over, I called the ambulance and put pressure on his wound as I asked him basic questions like « what’s your name » « what day is it »… the man had a memory reset every 30 seconds and I was all alone with him for 30 minutes.
The ambulances finally made it and he was treated adequately.

Fast forward to last month, I received 10 texts and phone calls from the man where he said he wanted to see me and thank me because « without you I’ll be gone » but to be honest even thinking about him makes me freeze and so scared. I don’t think I could ever see him again even if he really wants to. I am so glad he is okay but seriously traumatised from this event.

2383,yyzgm4,AITA for joking to a friend that sleeping next to my wife is like sleeping next to an old lady?,joking to a friend that sleeping next to my wife is like sleeping next to an old lady,"My (26M) wife (25F) and I have been together 10 years, I’ve seen in post comments “this is a deal breaker” or “leave them” and I’d like to preemptively ask for people to not say this, in any case it’s a minor argument.

I’d had a few friends around, one of my friends was in his first ever committed relationship, we’re all super happy for him.

He mentioned that he’s having problems sharing a bed with her, she kicks, this led to a few of my friends laughing and sharing a few stories of their own…I did join in and said that sometimes sleeping next to my wife was like sleeping next to an old lady, but I didn’t really go much into details other than mentioning she drools (not a problem)

In reality it’s that she’s diabetic, type 1, and whilst normally in range when her sugars are high she’s up and down every 5 minutes for the loo!! This is personal, didn’t say it to my friends (they don’t need to know) it’s just gotten worse since we had a baby because now bathroom + baby keeps me awake.

I suppose she overheard because she got super pouty, said she didn’t appreciate the joke and that she’d sleep elsewhere since I didn’t wanna share with grandpa, I may have laughed at that (**wrong thing to do!!**)

I apologised and mentioned that my friends were sharing stories and honestly what I said wasn’t overly embarrassing! She said “I don’t care, I’m not their partner” I apologised again, she said she’d sleep elsewhere but I’m sleeping on the sofa so she doesn’t have to - ironically enough though she’s still proving my point as the baby has yet to cry but she’s up and down for the loo (like an old person)

…I may have backtracked on my apologies by saying good night grandpa, but I had apologised twice by then 

She’s made little jabs about our relationship, jokingly, to her sister and I’ve never said a word because it’s a joke?

I honestly don’t think I’m this much of an AH in this situation?

2388,yz8brk,AITA for thinking the way my bf is treating my son is unfair?,thinking the way my bf is treating my son is unfair,"My boyfriend of 6 years Jack and I decided to move in together. We both have children from our previous relationships. He has a 14 years old daughter that we'll call Lu and I have a 16 years old son that we'll call Ethan.

I have a 1 bedroom home with a basement that I turned into a bedroom for Ethan so we couldn't move in our home and while Jack has a 3 bedroom home he said he needed one of the rooms as an office since he WFH so we had to find another home. We decided to sell our homes and buy one home together and we finally found our dream home and it has 4 bedrooms. One master bedroom, one bedroom with an en suit and two smaller bedrooms. The master room is obviously for me and Jack and the smallest room will be his office. The issue is the other two bedrooms.

Growing up in our home the biggest room was always for the oldest child so I assumed Ethan would have the room with en suit and the other one will be for Lu.

Ethan loved the room. A few days ago I was talking to Jack and told him how excited Ethan is about having a bigger room and his own en suit, he looked at me confused and said that room is for Lu not Ethan. I told him that it's not fair because Ethan is older so he should get the bigger room and once he left for college Lu can get that room. He said that's not gonna happen because Lu always had an en suit and she is used to having it and she shouldn't lose this. I was getting angry at this point and told him she can survive from walking a few steps to go to the bathroom and he sarcastically told me that Ethan can survive it too and Ethan's last bedroom was way smaller than this so it will actually be an upgrade for him while for Lu it'll be a downgrade. I told him it's not fair that just because my son didn't have a big bedroom before he can never get one.

To make the matter worse I was talking about buying new furniture for Ethan's room since his furniture is too old and asked him if he could help me a bit and he told me he is planning to buy new furniture for Lu too because this whole situation is ""very difficult for her and he wants to make her feel better"" he offered that he could buy new things for Lu and Ethan can use Lu's old things. I blew up at him and asked him if that's how much he cares about my son? He gets the smaller room and the old furniture while his daughter gets the bigger room and new furniture? He thinks I'm an asshole for ""expecting his daughter to suffer for my son"" but I don't think that is ""suffering"". The bedroom is nice and she'll only have to be there for 2 years and the furniture are new and good enough. She doesn't need new furniture",my boyfriend of years jack and i decided to move in together we both have children from our previous relationships he has a years old daughter that well call lu and i have a years old son that well call ethan i have a bedroom home with a basement that i turned into a bedroom for ethan so we couldnt move in our home and while jack has a bedroom home he said he needed one of the rooms as an office since he wfh so we had to find another home we decided to sell our homes and buy one home together and we finally found our dream home and it has bedrooms one master bedroom one bedroom with an en suit and two smaller bedrooms the master room is obviously for me and jack and the smallest room will be his office the issue is the other two bedrooms growing up in our home the biggest room was always for the oldest child so i assumed ethan would have the room with en suit and the other one will be for lu ethan loved the room a few days ago i was talking to jack and told him how excited ethan is about having a bigger room and his own en suit he looked at me confused and said that room is for lu not ethan i told him that its not fair because ethan is older so he should get the bigger room and once he left for college lu can get that room he said thats not gonna happen because lu always had an en suit and she is used to having it and she shouldnt lose this i was getting angry at this point and told him she can survive from walking a few steps to go to the bathroom and he sarcastically told me that ethan can survive it too and ethans last bedroom was way smaller than this so it will actually be an upgrade for him while for lu itll be a downgrade i told him its not fair that just because my son didnt have a big bedroom before he can never get one to make the matter worse i was talking about buying new furniture for ethans room since his furniture is too old and asked him if he could help me a bit and he told me he is planning to buy new furniture for lu too because this whole situation is very difficult for her and he wants to make her feel better he offered that he could buy new things for lu and ethan can use lus old things i blew up at him and asked him if thats how much he cares about my son he gets the smaller room and the old furniture while his daughter gets the bigger room and new furniture he thinks im an asshole for expecting his daughter to suffer for my son but i dont think that is suffering the bedroom is nice and shell only have to be there for years and the furniture are new and good enough she doesnt need new furniture,525,ESH
2389,yz9veg,AITA for accepting my family's Christmas invitation despite my husband being upset?,accepting my familys christmas invitation despite my husband being upset,"


I [F32] I met this wonderful man 'Philip"" [M36] 2 years ago. We got married 4 months ago. For context, I have a 10 yo son ""Billy"" from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture.


I have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time).


The latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them ""ignorant"" for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house.


Now they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd ""automatically"" celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy.


We went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy. So you can see how much pressure I'm getting from both sides here.",i f i met this wonderful man philip m years ago we got married months ago for context i have a yo son billy from my previous relationship and my ex isnt in the picture i have to admit that philips relationship with my family isnt so great they would disagree on a lot of things for example he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but philip stated he wasnt and that he couldnt visit with billy because he had work i was sick at the time the latest argument was what made things worse my mom and sister were discussing natural remedies theyre into this stuff for my niece and philip hes a pediatrician called both of them ignorant for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and philip being no longer welcome at my parents house now theyd sent me and billy an invitation for christmas but did not include philip which i expected given how strained their relationship has become i called my mom to confirm that ill attend but the minute philip found out he went off saying he could not believe i was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind i told him its their celebration and i dont get to decide their guestlist for them and also im not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for christmas he said he thought that wed automatically celebrate together the of us but now im taking billy away from him as well i thought that was a bit melodramatic because its literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect we had a big argument and i said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family but he started ranting saying it wasnt about the fact that they didnt invite him but the fact that i was willing to let him spend christmas alone without me and billy we went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution my parents are used to spending every major holiday with billy so you can see how much pressure im getting from both sides here,389,YTA

I have been dating a guy for 10 months, it's getting pretty serious and we are even thinking about meeting each other's parents.

The problem is that.. I never told him I have a child. She lives in Bolivia with my sister, and I haven't seen her in 11 years. I don't feel like a mother at all. I talk to her maybe 2 to 3 times a year, birthday/christmas/important days. It felt right to not mention her, because she doesn't live with me.

But  we were planning to go to Bolivia to meet my family, so my daughter too. They do not speak English, so I'd pretry much be the translator . So, I decided to tell him that I had a child back in my home country but that it wouldn't change anything in our lives, that we could have our own family one day.

He got super p*ssed off, told me I deceived him, he's been ignoring for a week now.
