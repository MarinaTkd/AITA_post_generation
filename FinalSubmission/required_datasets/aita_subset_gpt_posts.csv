0,0,AITA for asking my friend to move a picture of him and his wife because it made my wife uncomfortable?,"  Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.   Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that!   For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.   Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was ""bonkers"" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some ""explicit"" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such ""demand"" and be pushy still.   This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.

They've been dating for a few years, and while we get along well, he has a tendency to display photos and memorabilia from past relationships. When they settled into their new place, he put up a large, sentimental photo of him with his ex-girlfriend at a festival. He’s mentioned how much that photo means to him, but it has become a point of tension for my wife (28F).

The issue came to a head when we visited Jake’s new place for the first time. As soon as we walked in, my wife’s face dropped when she saw the picture hanging prominently in the living room. She tried to play it cool, but I could see it was eating at her. Later, she confided in me that seeing the photo made her uncomfortable. She felt disrespected and worried that I might inadvertently compare her to Jake’s ex.

I totally understand the sentiment behind the photo, but I also want my wife to feel comfortable in any situation. So, I brought it up to Jake. I asked if he would mind taking it down or moving it to a less visible spot. I explained how it made my wife feel and stressed that it wasn’t about discrediting his past but rather about making our partner feel secure.

Jake reacted pretty negatively. He called me out for trying to dictate what he can or can't do in his own home. He insisted that I was overreacting and that I was being unreasonable. He said he had every right to honor his past, and it was unfair for me to ask him to change that. The conversation ended on a sour note, and now he’s upset with me, and I feel like I’ve ruined our friendship over this.

My wife thinks I did the right thing, while some mutual friends are divided. Some agree with me, believing that while memories are important, they shouldn’t come at the cost of a partner’s comfort. Others think I was out of line for asking him to change his decor, suggesting that it’s a part of who he is.

So, AITA for expecting my friend to remove or relocate a sentimental photo that’s making my wife uncomfortable?","My friend, Adam, has this photo on his living room wall of him and his ex-girlfriend, Sarah. They were together for seven years and broke up about five years ago. The photo itself is a beautiful, candid moment captured during their trip to Paris, a place Sarah always wanted to visit. It's framed nicely and is clearly sentimental to him.

I've been best friends with Adam since college, and Sarah was a mutual friend, so this photo has always been there. However, recently, my wife, Lisa, started getting really uncomfortable whenever we visit Adam. She mentioned that seeing the photo of Adam and Sarah makes her uneasy because of how intense their relationship was and how it seems like Adam hasn't moved on.

I understand that Adam and Sarah's relationship was significant, but I feel like it’s just a part of his past. Yet, to be supportive of my wife, I decided to talk to Adam about it. I suggested he should remove or at least relocate the photo, explaining how it made Lisa uncomfortable. I tried to be as respectful as possible, but Adam got really upset. He told me the photo holds a lot of memories for him, not just of his relationship with Sarah, but of a beautiful time in his life, and he doesn’t see why he should have to hide it.

After the conversation, Lisa was initially relieved but then felt guilty for causing a rift between me and Adam. Mutual friends are divided on the issue: some think it's just a photo and Adam has every right to keep it while others believe he should be more considerate of my wife's feelings.

Adam and I haven't spoken much since, and I feel like I've overstepped a boundary. The photo is in his house, part of his personal space, and he shouldn’t have to change it for someone else's comfort. But at the same time, I can't ignore my wife's discomfort.

For some background, my husband ""Mark"" and I have been married for five years, and his family is very close-knit. Mark’s brother passed away unexpectedly, leaving a deep impact on all of us.

A couple of weeks before the funeral, I started feeling really unwell. I’ve had a chronic condition for years that flares up from time to time, and unfortunately, it decided to rear its head right at the worst possible moment. I was exhausted, in pain, and I knew that if I were to attend the funeral, I wouldn’t even be able to be present or support my husband the way he needed me to be. 

I tried to discuss it with Mark, but he was understandably very emotional and insisted that I should be there. He said it was about family and that missing the funeral would be seen as a sign that I didn’t care. I felt torn—of course I cared, but my own health was taking a toll. After wrestling with it for several days, I decided that it would be in everyone's best interest if I stayed home to focus on taking care of myself.

The day of the funeral, I tried to reach out to Mark with supportive messages, but I could tell he was upset. When he returned home, he was clearly frustrated. He told me that I had let him down and that my absence had made him feel even more alone during such a tough time. His family also reached out to express their disappointment, saying that they couldn’t believe I chose my health over being there for them.

I completely get where they are coming from, and I genuinely feel bad for not being there for Mark and his family. But I also know that pushing through my health issues wouldn’t have been beneficial for anyone. I've been reflecting on this a lot, and I’m beginning to wonder if I was wrong to prioritize my health in such a sensitive situation. 

So, AITA for prioritizing my own health over attending my husband’s brother's funeral?","I've been dealing with some serious health issues over the past year, including a chronic condition that flares up unpredictably and leaves me bedridden for days. It's been really challenging for me, and I've been doing my best to manage my health while still trying to be present in our family life. My husband, Alex, has been mostly supportive, but recently, we hit a rough patch.

Alex's brother, Jake, passed away unexpectedly two weeks ago. It was a shock to everyone, and understandably, Alex was devastated. The funeral was scheduled for last Saturday, a few states away, which required us to fly out and stay there for a couple of days. Unfortunately, I was in the middle of one of my worst flare-ups when the time came to leave.

I explained to Alex that traveling in my condition would be incredibly difficult and could potentially worsen my health. I suggested that he go alone and represent both of us, or that I could join virtually via a video call if someone could set it up. Alex was furious. He argued that I needed to be there to support him and the family, and accused me of being selfish and prioritizing my own comfort over his grief.

Our friends and family had mixed reactions when they found out. Some understood my situation and agreed that I needed to prioritize my health, while others sided with Alex, saying that I should have pushed through the pain for this one day. My sister-in-law even called me directly to tell me how much Jake meant to everyone and how my absence was disrespectful.

In the end, Alex went alone, and when he returned, things were tense between us. He barely spoke to me for days and has since been distant. I feel guilty for not being there, but I also believe that taking care of my health was the responsible thing to do. 

So, AITA for prioritizing my own health over attending my husband's brother's funeral?"
2,2,"AITA for wanting to meet my ""daughter"" after giving up my parental rights?","Long story short: in my (40f) twenties I had a one night stand with this guy ""Nathan"" (now 41m) and got pregnant. I first thought of having an abortion, but Nathan had come from a conservative religious background (not Christian) and wanted the baby so we made a deal: I would give birth to the child and sign away my parental rights (my name is not even in her birth certificate, it's a possibility in my country) and he would pay all the medical expenses plus some extra for my troubles. That's what we did and didn't keep contact after his daughter was born.  A few weeks ago, a friend of mine who has the same religion as Nathan sent me a post from her temple's youth group (they were asking for donations for the homeless) and one of the girls from the picture looked a lot like me. I searched for her profile and found out that she had Nathan's surname and had the right age to be the baby I gave away. She's 17 now and seems to be doing fine: she is involved in charity work, apparently loves music and has lots of pictures with friends and family (Nathan, his wife and half-siblings).  I never wanted nor want to be a mother but I became curious to know more about this human I put in the world, so I texted Nathan's old phone number, which he has not changed, and asked if he would allow me to meet his daughter, since I gave birth to her and everything, and made my intentions clear: I do not want to interfere with his family, just to know her. He then wrote a long text which comes down to the fact that I am an asshole for wanting to know his daughter now after I ""abandoned"" her and that this meeting would only mess up with her head. I told him I was telling him out of courtesy because soon the girl will be an adult and be able to choose herself if she wants to meet me. He then blocked me.  Am I being the asshole here? I don't think there is any harm in meeting my ""daughter""; she already has a great family and it would only be beneficial to her to know about her own history. But maybe I am not seeing the full picture.  Also sorry for any mistakes or weird phrases, English is not my first language.  &#x200B;  UPDATE  Hi everyone. First of all, thank you for your judgement. Some of you were were pretty harsh and a bit misogynistic to be honest, but I needed to hear what the well-intentioned comments had to say. Some answers to common assumptions:   1. I wasn’t coherced into giving birth.  Nathan and I reached an agreement in a situation that involved us both.

It was just a one-night stand that resulted in a surprise pregnancy. Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, I felt it was best for the child that I put them up for adoption. It was one of the hardest decisions I ever made, but I truly believed it was the right one at that time.

Fast forward about 20 years, and I've often found myself reflecting on that chapter of my life. I've thought about my child and what they might be like, but I've never reached out to the adoptive family. Recently, though, I found out some information about Dave's family through social media—his parents are still very much a part of his life and have shared some touching posts about their journey. This reignited a spark in me. I wanted to see how my child was doing, and perhaps even how Dave’s family felt about the situation. 

So, I reached out to them. I was nervous but thought it was important to be honest about my past and intentions. I didn’t want to disrupt anyone's life but hoped to at least share my story and maybe leave the door open for future communication if they were open to it. 

Reaching out turned out to be a mixed bag. Some family members were really friendly and supportive, while others felt it was inappropriate considering the circumstances. They were understandably protective of my child, and I completely respected that—they’re their family now. I assured them I had no intention of intruding but just wanted to check in.

The whole situation has created a lot of conversation among my friends and family. Some think I was brave for wanting to reconnect and that it’s okay to reach out after all these years. Others feel that it was inappropriate to involve my ex's family after so much time has passed and that I should have just respected the life they've built without interference.

In light of that, I wonder if what I did was wrong or if I went about it in a respectful manner. Am I the asshole for reaching out to my ex's family 20 years after a one-night stand and an adoption?","Twenty years ago, I had a one-night stand with a man I hardly knew. I found out I was pregnant a few weeks later. At the time, I was young, scared, and not in a place to raise a child, so I made the difficult decision to place the baby for adoption. It was an open adoption, and I receive yearly updates and photos through the agency. I never reached out to the biological father after finding out I was pregnant, because he made it clear he wasn’t interested in anything beyond that one night.

Fast forward to now, my daughter (whom I placed for adoption) recently turned 20. I’ve been in touch with her occasionally through letters, and recently, she expressed a desire to learn more about her biological roots, including her father’s side of the family. She knows the situation and that I never reached out to him, but she wants to understand her heritage better.

So, I decided to reach out to my ex's family. After some online sleuthing, I found what I believe to be a relative of his, and I sent them a polite message explaining the situation, emphasizing that there are no expectations of a relationship, but that it would mean a lot to my daughter to learn about her biological father’s side.

The response was mixed. Some of the family members were willing to help and answered some questions about health history and family heritage. Others were less receptive and felt it was inappropriate for me to reach out after so many years, especially given the nature of how things ended. A few expressed concern about disrupting their lives, and my ex's current spouse (whom he's been married to for 15 years) seemed particularly upset about it.

I understand their concerns, and I never intended to create any drama or discomfort. I just wanted to help my daughter find the answers she’s been searching for. My friends are split; some say I did the right thing for my daughter, while others believe I should have respected the past and left it alone.

So, am I the asshole for reaching out to my ex’s family after twenty years to help my daughter understand her roots?"

Emily has a habit of borrowing my stuff without asking, and while I generally try to be chill about it, this time it really pushed my buttons. 

A few weeks ago, I bought a few heads of garlic from the farmer's market because I love cooking with fresh ingredients. I specifically put them on a shelf in the kitchen that I designated as “mine” to avoid confusion. I came home one day to find that all my garlic was gone. I assumed she took it without asking since she has a tendency to do that with perishable items she knows I love.

After realizing they were gone, I confronted her about it, and she initially denied it. But then, later on, I overheard her joking with some friends that I was “hoarding garlic” like it was some kind of precious resource. I was so frustrated because it felt disrespectful and just plain silly—I'm no garlic hoarder! 

So, I snapped a bit and told her that if she wanted to borrow stuff, she should at least ask and not spread lies about it. Emily got defensive and accused me of overreacting. She said I was being dramatic about a “trivial” situation and that it was just garlic at the end of the day. We went back and forth, and honestly, it escalated into a pretty ugly fight.

Our friends who witnessed the whole thing have mixed thoughts. Some agree with me and think she should respect my things and be more considerate, while others say I was being too uptight over something small. 

Now, the tension between us is awkward, and I feel guilty for how I reacted, but I still think it’s unfair for her to take my stuff without asking and lie about it. 

So, AITA for being mad at my roommate for stealing garlic and spreading a lie about it?","My roommate (22F) and I (23F) have been living together for about six months now. We’ve generally had a pretty good dynamic, but lately, things have gotten rocky over something seemingly trivial—garlic.

Last week, I noticed that the jar of minced garlic I keep in the fridge had been going down much faster than usual. I use it often, but I know for sure I didn’t use that much. When I asked my roommate about it, she denied taking any initially. I let it slide, thinking maybe I misjudged how much I had left.

A few days later, I walked in on her clearly using my minced garlic while cooking. I confronted her again, and she finally admitted to using it but insisted it was just a little bit and only once or twice. Annoyed but not wanting to start a huge fight over garlic, I told her to just ask next time and let her know I didn’t appreciate the lying.

Fast forward to the weekend, and one of our mutual friends mentioned how they heard I’ve been hoarding food and not sharing anything, which is not true at all. I frequently share ingredients and even cook meals for us sometimes. Turns out, my roommate had been telling people that I freaked out over the garlic and hoarded the food, painting me as this stingy, unreasonable person.

When I confronted her about spreading this lie, she got defensive and said that I was overreacting and making a big deal out of nothing. She claimed she only said that because she felt I was being too controlling over communal stuff and that my reaction was over the top for such a minor issue.

Our friends are divided. Some say I’m justified in being upset since she lied and then made it seem like I’m the bad guy. Others think it's just garlic and I should let it go, arguing that I did overreact and come off as controlling.

Now, things are tense, and it’s affecting not just us but our friend group too. I acknowledge I might have blown up a bit, but I’m hurt by the dishonesty and the way she portrayed me to others. She says I’m overreacting and need to chill out.

So, AITA for being mad at my roommate for stealing garlic and spreading a lie about it, or did I take this too far?"

My younger brother (let's call him Jake) just got married last weekend, and it was a pretty big deal for him and his fiancée. They had a lot of specific rules and expectations for the wedding day, which they laid out clearly for all guests. Things like a strict dress code, no plus-ones unless explicitly invited, and an alcohol-free ceremony. They really wanted everything to go their way, and I get that it’s their day.

Now, I consider myself pretty close to my brother, but honestly, I wasn't on board with some of these rules. For one, I think the dress code was a bit over the top; it was a casual wedding but they wanted everyone in formal attire. I ended up wearing a nice sundress instead of a full-on gown. I also had a friend in town who I hadn’t seen in ages, and I invited her to the reception since I was given the impression it was going to be a more relaxed celebration afterward. 

When the day finally came, I arrived in my sundress, and I could see Jake's face when he noticed. I could also see he was annoyed when I showed up with my friend, who wasn’t on the guest list. It didn’t help that I brought along a bottle of wine to share during the reception. Let’s just say he lost it. He pulled me aside and told me I was disrespecting him and his new wife’s wishes, ruining what was supposed to be a perfect day for them. I tried to explain that I was there to celebrate and wanted to make it special for both of us, but he was having none of it.

After the wedding, my parents weighed in. They sided with Jake, saying I should have respected their wishes, and that it was inconsiderate of me to show up as I did. Some other relatives agreed with them, while a few thought I wasn’t in the wrong for trying to make the day more enjoyable for myself and my friend. 

Now I feel terrible about how things went down. I love my brother and didn't intend to ruin anything, but I also don't think I should have to completely change myself for his day either. So, AITA for disregarding my brother’s wedding rules and expectations?","My (28F) brother (31M) recently got married, and it was a big deal for our family. My brother and his fiancée are very particular people, and they had a whole list of rules and expectations for their wedding. Some of these rules included no kids, a specific dress code, and strict instructions about social media posts. They even had a wedding planner who was like a hawk, making sure everyone followed the guidelines.

A few weeks before the wedding, I found out that my partner (27M) had a work commitment that clashed with the wedding date. This was a rare and important opportunity for him, so I decided to attend the wedding without him. It was a bit awkward because the RSVP was already sent, but I thought it wasn't a big deal and didn't inform my brother. 

On the wedding day, I wore a dress that slightly deviated from the color scheme. It was still formal, but I chose something I felt more comfortable in. At the reception, I posted a few candid pictures of the ceremony on my Instagram story against their request to wait until they posted the official photos. 

Later that evening, my brother pulled me aside. He was livid about my partner not showing up without any prior notice, my outfit choice, and my social media posts. I apologized but felt that he was overreacting. My partner's work commitment was unavoidable, and I didn't think my dress or a few Instagram posts would ruin their day.

Our parents sided with him, saying that wedding rules should be respected, and I should have communicated better about my partner. My friends, however, think the rules were too stringent and that I did nothing wrong by expressing myself.

Now, there's a lot of tension between my brother and me. He's been distant and cold, which is unusual for us. I understand that it was his special day, but I also feel that he and his fiancée were too controlling.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for disregarding my brother's wedding rules and expectations?"

Recently, I found out that my wife has been spending £30 a week on ballet lessons for our daughter. 

At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as the weeks went on, I started to notice how that money could add up. I mentioned to my wife that we have other expenses—like her nursery fees, groceries, and saving for a family vacation. I was trying to suggest we could save that £30 for things that might be more impactful for our daughter, like music classes or swimming lessons instead, which I believed would be more beneficial at this age. 

When I brought it up, she became defensive. This quickly escalated into an argument, and I ended up freaking out on her. I expressed my frustration that she was spending what I saw as a significant amount on something our daughter wouldn’t even appreciate yet. My wife argued that ballet could help with coordination and introduce our daughter to activities she might enjoy, and I get that, but I felt the money could be better spent elsewhere.

In the aftermath of the argument, I realized I might have overreacted. My wife said she felt like I was dismissing her desire to nurture our daughter's interests, and that I was being controlling. I can see where she’s coming from, but it still feels frustrating knowing how tight our budget can be.

Now, our relationship feels strained, and I regret how I handled the situation. My friends think I had a valid point about the costs, while others believe I should have supported my wife's choice. Am I the asshole for freaking out on my wife for spending £30 a week on ballet lessons for our 2-year-old?","My wife (28F) and I (30M) have been married for four years. We have a beautiful 2-year-old daughter, Emily. Recently, my wife decided to enroll Emily in ballet lessons. While I understand that she wants to introduce our daughter to different activities early, I was shocked when I found out these lessons cost £30 a week.

We have always been cautious about our budget, especially since we are trying to save up for a house. Both of us work, but our incomes aren't exactly high, and £30 a week adds up quickly. When I approached my wife about the cost, she brushed me off, saying it was a small price to pay for Emily's happiness and development.

The final straw came last week when I saw our bank statement and realized how much we had spent on these lessons already. I snapped and confronted her, asking why she didn't discuss such a significant expense with me first. I was angry and probably louder than I should have been. My wife got defensive and told me I was overreacting, saying that it's important for Emily to start developing skills early.

I agree that activities are essential, but our daughter is only two. I feel like it's too early for something as structured as ballet, especially when it impacts our savings. We got into a huge argument, and she accused me of not wanting the best for Emily. I, in turn, accused her of being irresponsible with our finances.

Our friends are divided on the issue. Some agree with me, saying that we need to prioritize saving for our future. Others side with my wife, suggesting that investing in Emily’s interests and development is worth the cost.

In the end, we've both cooled down, but there's still tension between us. We haven't come to a resolution, and it feels like this issue is just festering. So, am I the asshole for freaking out on my wife for spending £30 a week on ballet lessons for our 2-year-old, or was I justified in my concerns about our budget?"

I love the fall season, and I was excited to enjoy some fun activities together. However, as the day went on, things took a turn for the worse.

When we arrived, my girlfriend and her friends immediately started to plan their day, and I noticed they were all chatting and laughing while I was left out of the conversation. I tried to join in, sharing my thoughts on which pumpkins were the best and suggesting some fun games, but they seemed to brush me off. They were so caught up in their own little world that I felt like I was invisible.

After a while, I decided to go for a walk by myself, hoping to cool down and maybe gather my thoughts. I thought maybe they would miss me and come looking for me, but I came back to find them still engrossed in their own jokes, completely disregarding my presence. I felt hurt and frustrated. I had made an effort to be there, and it was disheartening to feel like I was just an afterthought.

Eventually, I snapped. I told my girlfriend that I felt ignored and that if they didn’t want me around, I would just leave. She and her friends laughed it off, thinking I was joking. That was the final straw for me. I left the pumpkin patch and went home, feeling a mix of anger and disappointment.

Now, my girlfriend is upset with me for abandoning her and her friends, claiming that I overreacted and should have just communicated my feelings instead of storming off. Some of her friends have also reached out to tell me that I needed to be more understanding since they were just having a good time and didn’t mean to exclude me.

In hindsight, I realize that my actions in leaving might have been a bit extreme, but I felt completely ignored. AITA for leaving my girlfriend and her friends at the pumpkin patch after they ignored me?","My girlfriend, Sarah, and I have been dating for almost a year. She and her friends often have these big group outings, and although I’m naturally more introverted, I usually go to make her happy. Last weekend, Sarah planned a trip to a pumpkin patch with me and her friends. She was really excited, and I was too, thinking it’d be a fun day together.

When we got there, though, it felt like I was invisible. Sarah and her friends immediately grouped together, chatting and laughing, and I was left trailing behind. I tried to join their conversations multiple times, but they barely acknowledged me. I smiled, made comments, and attempted to engage, but it was like I didn’t exist to them.

It got worse when we started doing the activities. Sarah would take photos with her friends, run ahead with them, and I was left alone most of the time. The final straw came when they all decided to go to a food truck and didn’t even tell me. I found out because I saw them in the line from afar.

I felt completely ignored and hurt. I texted Sarah that I was leaving and drove home. I understand it might have been a bit dramatic, but I was really upset. When she got back, she was furious, saying I embarrassed her and her friends were asking why I left.

I explained why I felt the way I did, but she thinks I overreacted and should have just stuck it out. Some of our mutual friends are divided. A few say I was justified because they were being rude, but others think I should have just brought it up to Sarah directly rather than leaving.

Now things are tense between us, and I’m questioning if I handled it the right way. Should I have just dealt with it or tried harder to talk to Sarah in the moment?

Kids asks if I want to play a game and I'm bored so I agree.  This is where I totally wipe the floor with the kid. Like no contest at all. He trys several different game modes and rules to try and get a win in and he takes the l every time. After a few losses he's getting visibly frustrated, his teenaged sibling tries to keep him calm to no avail.

I love gaming and have been playing Smash for years, so I thought it’d be a fun way to get everyone involved. 

My friend’s son, let’s call him Sam (10), is super into gaming too, and I’m aware he looks up to me as a sort of mentor. He was really excited about the tournament and made it clear he wanted to win. Naturally, I wanted to make the tournament competitive and fun for everyone, so I signed up for the event myself.

Long story short, during the tournament, I ended up facing Sam in the semifinals. I was aware that he was fully determined to win and was really eager to show off his skills. I tried to play a bit more casually, but I didn’t want to let him win just because he was a kid. Ultimately, I ended up wiping the floor with him, winning the match decisively. 

Sam was visibly crushed when he lost, and I felt awful. He sulked for a while, and I tried to console him, saying that losing is part of the game and that he could learn from it. Still, I could tell he was really bummed out about it and ended up leaving the tournament early. His mom was upset too, saying I should have let him win, and that I ruined his Halloween. 

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. On one hand, I believe in competition and think that kids need to learn how to lose gracefully. But on the other hand, I never intended to crush his spirit or ruin his fun. My friends are divided; some think I should have just let him win, while others say it was a fair match.

So, am I the asshole for crushing a kid's spirit at a Halloween party Smash Brothers tournament?","I recently attended a Halloween party hosted by a good friend. The party was a costume extravaganza, filled with decorations, candy, and various activities, one of which was a Smash Brothers tournament. I'm a big fan of the game and consider myself quite skilled, so I was looking forward to it.

At the party, there were a mix of adults and kids. One of the kids, let's call him Timmy, who was around 10 years old, was particularly excited about the tournament. He was dressed as Mario and kept talking about how much he loved playing Smash Brothers. Timmy's enthusiasm was infectious, and everyone encouraged him, considering he was probably the youngest participant.

The tournament started, and I noticed that most of the other adults were going easy on the kids, letting them win or at least giving them a fair chance. When it was my turn to play against Timmy, I decided to go all out. In my mind, I thought it would be a good lesson for him – to show that sometimes you have to deal with losing and that you have to work hard to win.

I played my best character and gave it my all, not holding back at all. Within a few minutes, I had completely annihilated Timmy in the game. He looked devastated, and his excitement quickly turned to disappointment. He tried to hold back tears, but it was clear that I had crushed his spirit. The room fell silent, and everyone, including the other adults and parents, looked at me with disapproval.

My friend who hosted the party pulled me aside later and told me that while they understood I wanted to play well, I should have considered the context and maybe gone a bit easier on Timmy. They reminded me that the tournament was meant to be fun for everyone, especially the kids who were looking forward to it. 

Since then, I've been feeling really conflicted. I honestly thought I was teaching him a valuable lesson, but now I'm not so sure. Some of my friends agree with me, saying that kids need to learn how to handle losing, but most think I went too far and should have shown more empathy.

So, AITA for crushing a kid's spirit at a Halloween party Smash Brothers tournament?"

While I cover her tuition, textbooks, and provide a monthly allowance for groceries and necessities, I also made it clear that she would need to contribute something while living at home during the summer.

After her first year, Mia decided she wanted to spend the summer back home instead of getting an internship. I was completely fine with that, but I told her I expected her to pitch in by paying a small portion of rent. I explained to her that it’s not about the money itself—it's about her learning financial responsibility and understanding the value of contributing to the household.

When I first brought it up, Mia was shocked and felt hurt, saying that since I already support her financially, expecting her to pay rent was unreasonable. I tried to explain that while I’m more than happy to help her out, I wanted her to take on some responsibility and be part of a household. After all, her brother, who’s 21, has been paying rent while he finishes his degree too.

Mia’s been really upset about it, and she feels like I’m being harsh. My wife, Sarah, agrees with Mia and thinks I’m being unfair, especially since I support her education. She believes that I should be happy Mia is home for the summer. I love my daughter and want the best for her, but I also believe in the importance of life lessons.

Now, Mia's been distant, and I can't help but feel guilty for pushing this issue. I’m starting to question whether I’m being unreasonable expecting her to pay anything at all, especially since I'm already supporting her so much. AITA for expecting my college-aged daughter to pay rent when she already gets financial support?","My daughter, Emily (F20), is a sophomore in college. She goes to a school about two hours away from home and lives in an off-campus apartment. My wife and I have been supporting her financially by paying for her tuition, books, and a small monthly allowance to cover her basic needs. Emily also works a part-time job to have some spending money of her own.

Recently, my wife Cathy (F48) and I (M50) had a discussion about teaching Emily more responsibility. We thought it would be a good idea for her to start paying a small amount of rent to us each month. We figured it would help her learn to budget better and prepare her for the real world. We decided on $200 a month, which we thought was reasonable considering that we cover most of her major expenses.

When I brought this up to Emily during one of her visits home, she was visibly upset. She said that balancing school and work was already stressful enough and that adding an additional financial burden would only increase her stress. She also mentioned that many of her friends don't have to pay rent to their parents and felt it was unfair for us to ask this of her when we were already providing financial support. I tried to explain our perspective, saying that we wanted her to learn about financial responsibility and that $200 wasn't an unreasonable amount.

Emily started crying and said that we were putting unnecessary pressure on her. Cathy, who had initially agreed with me, began to look concerned and suggested we reconsider. However, I felt that we should stick to our decision to teach her this important lesson. Emily then went back to her apartment and has been distant ever since, barely answering my texts or calls. Cathy thinks we might have been too hard on her and suggested we drop the idea for now, but I'm not sure if that's the right move.

Friends and family have mixed opinions. Some agree with me, saying it's a good way to teach responsibility, while others think we're being too harsh and adding unnecessary stress to Emily's life. 

Now, I'm starting to question whether I was too strict in my approach. Emily is a good kid, does well in school, and has always been responsible. Maybe I should have taken her feelings more into account.

So, AITA for expecting my college-aged daughter to pay rent when she already gets financial support?"

She's always been vocal about these issues, and I respect her dedication. We often have discussions about race, privilege, and the struggles that marginalized communities face. 

Recently, Sarah organized a small gathering to talk about racism and ways to be allies. I was excited to join, but as the conversations got deeper, I found myself feeling a little out of my depth. When she asked everyone to share their experiences with racism or how they’ve seen it manifest in society, I hesitated because, well, I’m white and have never directly experienced racism. 

When it was my turn, I awkwardly said, ""Honestly, I don’t really understand racism because I'm white. I mean, I get that it exists and it's terrible, but it's hard for me to fully grasp it since I've never lived through it."" I thought I was being honest and acknowledging my privilege, but Sarah’s reaction was immediate and intense. She called me out for being dismissive and said that my perspective was incredibly myopic. 

I felt attacked and tried to explain that I wasn’t trying to undermine her experiences or the importance of the conversation. But she continued to emphasize that my statement sounded like I was negating the reality of racism instead of recognizing how it impacts others. A few of the other attendees nodded in agreement, which made me feel even worse. 

After that, the atmosphere shifted, and I felt like I was a pariah. Sarah later told me that I had derailed an important discussion with my comment. I tried to apologize and express that I was genuinely trying to engage in the conversation the best I could, but she wasn't having it. I ended up leaving the gathering early, feeling confused and hurt. 

Now I'm reflecting on what happened. Did I really say something that bad? My friends seem to be divided. Some say I was trying to be honest about my perspective, while others believe I should have been more aware of my privilege and how that can come across as insensitive. 

So, am I the asshole for saying I don't understand racism because I'm white?","I (23M) got into a heated argument with my friend, Mia (24F), and now I'm wondering if I made a big mistake. Mia and I have been friends for almost six years. She's Black, and we've always been able to talk about anything. Recently, we were having a conversation about the challenges she faces at work. She mentioned feeling like she's constantly overlooked for promotions and sometimes hears comments that make her uncomfortable. 

I tried to be supportive and listen, but then I made a comment that I think might have crossed the line. I said, ""I don't really understand what you're going through because I'm white."" I thought I was being honest and transparent about my limitations in understanding her experiences fully. However, Mia got really quiet and then said it was incredibly dismissive of me to say that. 

I didn't see it that way at all. In fact, I thought acknowledging my lack of understanding would make it clear that I know I'm not in a position to judge how she feels. But Mia told me that by saying I don't understand, I was essentially refusing to empathize or try to understand her situation better. 

I tried to explain my point of view, saying that I wasn't trying to negate her feelings but rather being upfront about my own ignorance. She just shook her head and said, “You could try to understand instead of just writing it off.” 

Later, I mentioned this to a couple of other friends, and they seemed to be divided. Some agreed with Mia, saying it was a tone-deaf comment, while others thought I was just being honest. 

Since then, our relationship has been a bit strained. Mia is distant, and I feel guilty because the last thing I wanted was to hurt her. Looking back, I realize there were probably better ways to show my support. Maybe I should have asked more questions or expressed my desire to understand her experiences better.

Mia is yet to respond to my apology text, and I'm feeling the weight of the situation. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my friend I don't understand racism because I'm white?"

AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Kicking My Bridesmaid Out of the Bridal Party Over Past Hurts?'""}]","I’ve been engaged for almost a year, and I was so excited to plan my wedding day. I’ve had my closest friends by my side throughout this process, including my longtime friend and bridesmaid, Sarah. We’ve known each other for over a decade, and while we’ve had some ups and downs, I always envisioned her standing beside me as I say ""I do.""

However, Sarah and I have had a complicated history. In high school, we had a pretty nasty falling out over some rumors and misunderstandings that caused a lot of hurt on both sides. We eventually reconciled, but those past issues tend to bubble up from time to time, especially when emotions run high.

Recently, during a dress fitting, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit distant and was making comments that felt undermining. She joked about my wedding planning being “overboard” and suggested I was “overreacting” when I shared my excitement about the venue. At first, I brushed it off, but as the day went on, I started to feel like her behavior was more than just teasing. It felt like a jab at my happiness rather than a friendly joke.

Finally, after a particularly hurtful comment about my choice of floral arrangements, I snapped. I told her that if she couldn’t support me during this important time in my life, maybe she shouldn’t be a part of the bridal party. It was a rash decision, fueled by all those old feelings coming back to the surface, and I kicked her out of the bridal party right then and there.

Now, with the wedding approaching, I feel both relieved and guilty. Some of my other friends think I made the right call and that it was important to stand my ground. Others, especially a few mutual friends, believe I was too harsh and that I could have addressed the issue more kindly instead of reacting impulsively.

Sarah is devastated and has reached out to me, wanting to discuss what happened. I’ve been ignoring her messages, feeling like maybe it’s better to keep my distance. But now I’m starting to wonder if I overreacted and if maybe, just maybe, I should have tried to resolve our issues instead of kicking her out of my life.

AITA for kicking my bridesmaid out of the bridal party over past hurts?","I've been planning my wedding for over a year now and it's finally just a few months away. It's been a whirlwind of emotions and decisions, but overall, it's shaping up to be my dream wedding. I have six bridesmaids, including one who used to be my best friend, Sarah.

Sarah and I have known each other since high school. We were inseparable back then, but we drifted apart during college. The reason for our fallout was pretty significant – she betrayed my trust by dating my ex-boyfriend just a month after we broke up. It took me years to get over that hurt, and while we've somewhat reconciled, our relationship has never been the same.

When I got engaged, I decided to include Sarah in my bridal party because I wanted to move past the old wounds and believed this could be a fresh start for us. Initially, things were okay, but as the wedding planning progressed, old feelings started to resurface. Every time we had a disagreement or she did something that slightly annoyed me, I would be reminded of the betrayal.

Last weekend, we had a bridesmaid dress fitting, and Sarah made an offhand comment about my ex-boyfriend, jokingly saying, ""Wow, remember when we both liked the same guy?"" That was the final straw for me. I felt my blood boil, and I just couldn't take it anymore.

I pulled Sarah aside and told her that I no longer wanted her to be part of my bridal party. I explained that her comment was the tip of the iceberg of unresolved issues and past hurts that I just couldn't ignore any longer. She was shocked and started crying, saying she thought we had moved past all that and that she was genuinely excited to support me on my big day.

When I told my fiancé and the rest of the bridal party what had happened, reactions were mixed. Some understood my feelings, but others thought I was overreacting and being too harsh, especially since the wedding is so close. My mom even suggested that I should have tried to talk things out with Sarah rather than making a hasty decision.

Now, Sarah and I aren't speaking, and I'm starting to feel guilty. Did I overreact? Should I have handled things differently? Am I the asshole for kicking my bridesmaid out of the bridal party over past hurts?"

Overall, we have a great relationship, but there’s one area where we often clash: health decisions. My wife tends to be very protective about her health choices, believing that everything should be a mutual decision. While I respect this to a degree, I sometimes feel that it hampers my ability to take care of my own health in a timely manner.

Recently, I started experiencing some new and concerning symptoms. I’ve been feeling fatigued, having headaches, and I just generally don’t feel like myself. I knew I needed to see a doctor, but whenever I mentioned it to my wife, she would respond with concern and ask me why I didn't want to wait to discuss it further or see if it got better on its own.

After a few weeks of waiting and feeling worse, I decided that I couldn't keep putting off my health. I went ahead and made a doctor's appointment without telling her, thinking it might ease the pressure. I figured I'd go to the appointment, get some answers, and then I could discuss it with her afterward. My thought process was that it was my body, and I should have the autonomy to seek help when I need it.

When I told her about the appointment later, she was furious. She felt betrayed and accused me of undermining our partnership. She said that we should be making these decisions together, especially when it concerns my health.

I understand her perspective, but I thought I was just taking charge of my own well-being. I think she sometimes takes it too far by trying to be involved in every decision. Now, she’s not speaking to me much, and our communication is strained. 

Friends who know us have mixed opinions; some support me in taking care of my health independently, while others side with her, saying I should have included her in the decision. 

So, to wrap it up, AITA for booking a doctor's appointment without my wife's consent?","My wife (35F) and I (36M) have been married for eight years, and we have two young children together. Over the past few months, I've noticed some worrying changes in her behavior. She seems more forgetful, loses her temper quickly, and has been experiencing frequent headaches. I’ve hinted a few times that she should see a doctor, but she dismisses it, saying she’s just stressed from work and managing the kids.

A couple of weeks ago, she had an episode where she forgot to pick up our kids from school. This is extremely out of character for her, and it worried me a lot. She was mortified when she realized and apologized profusely, but I could see that she was shaken by what happened. Since then, she’s been quite defensive whenever I bring up the topic of seeing a doctor.

I’m genuinely concerned that there might be something more serious going on with her health, and I want to make sure she’s okay. Last night, after another forgetful moment where she left the stove on, I started thinking about booking an appointment with her doctor myself, just to get the ball rolling. I figured it might be easier if all she had to do was show up. However, I haven't done it yet because I know she would be furious if she found out I did this without her consent.

I mentioned this to my friend, and he was adamant that I would be overstepping and disrespecting my wife’s autonomy if I went ahead and booked the appointment without her knowledge. He thinks I should keep talking to her and encourage her to go on her own terms. My mother, on the other hand, thinks I need to take action now for the sake of our family’s well-being.

This whole situation has caused a lot of tension at home. She’s been more irritable, and I don’t want to make things worse by pushing too hard, but I’m genuinely scared for her health, and ultimately for the safety of our kids.

In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship.

Recently, for my birthday, my boyfriend surprised me with a beautiful piece of jewelry. I loved it, and it felt incredibly thoughtful coming from him. However, I later found out that the exact same item was also gifted to his mom and sister for their birthdays earlier this year. 

At first, I was excited, but as I learned about the other gifts, I started to feel a bit put off. I know it was a lovely gesture, and the piece is definitely something I would have picked for myself, but I couldn't shake this feeling of being just “another one of the girls” in his life. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, but it felt a little less special knowing it was a “set.” 

When I shared my feelings with my boyfriend, he was genuinely shocked and insisted that he chose it because he thought I would love it, and he never meant to diminish the gift. He assured me that he thought I deserved something beautiful just like the women in his life. He really loves his mom and sister, and it’s sweet that he wants to share that love through gifts.

My friends have been split on this. Some think I should just accept the gift for what it is and appreciate the sentiment behind it. Others believe it’s understandable to feel a bit overshadowed on my special day and that it would be better if he had chosen something unique just for me. 

After discussing it with my boyfriend, I realized he genuinely had no ill intentions, and he was just trying to make me happy. I appreciate him, and I really don’t want to cause any friction with his family either. So I’m left wondering if I was being too sensitive about the whole situation.

Am I the asshole for feeling a bit put off by receiving the same gift as my boyfriend's mom and sister?","I've been dating my boyfriend, Jake, for almost two years now. He's a wonderful guy, and we've always had a good relationship. However, something happened recently that made me feel a bit off, and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting.

For context, Jake is very close to his family. He has a younger sister, Emily, and his mom, Karen, who are both lovely people. They treat me well, and I've never had any issues with them. We often celebrate holidays and birthdays together, and gift-giving has always been a big thing in their family.

A few weeks ago, it was my birthday. Jake had told me he had something special planned, and I was excited. When the day came, he gave me a beautifully wrapped box. I opened it to find a stunning necklace. It was really pretty and exactly my style. I was genuinely touched and thanked him profusely.

Later that same week, we got together with his family to celebrate his mom's birthday. To my surprise, Jake handed his mom a similar-looking box. She opened it and found the exact same necklace he had given me. I was taken aback but didn't say anything. Then, a couple of weeks later, Jake's sister Emily had her birthday, and guess what? She got the same necklace too.

I know it's just a piece of jewelry, and it's not the end of the world, but it made me feel less special. It felt like the thought he put into my gift wasn't as personal or unique as I had believed. When I mentioned it to a close friend, she said I was overthinking it and that it was probably just a coincidence. But when I talked to my own sister about it, she agreed that it was a bit odd and could see why I felt put off.

I haven't brought this up with Jake yet because I don't want to seem ungrateful or petty. I genuinely love the necklace, and I know he put effort into choosing it. But at the same time, I can't shake this feeling of disappointment.

Jake's mom and Emily were thrilled with their gifts, and no one else seems to find it weird. They've both complimented me on my necklace, and we've shared a laugh about being ""necklace triplets."" Nothing about the situation seems to bother them, but here I am feeling conflicted.

I understand that he might have thought the necklace was perfect for all of us and wanted to give something beautiful to the women he cares about. Maybe I'm just reading too much into it, but it left me feeling a bit off.

So, AITA for feeling put off by being given the same gift as my boyfriend's mom and sister?"

We were all super excited and naturally, the atmosphere was electric with anticipation as we entered the creepy old mansion. The haunted house was known for its dedicated actors who would really commit to their roles, and honestly, that’s what made it so fun.

As we made our way through, we encountered one actor who was particularly convincing. He was dressed as a chainsaw-wielding zombie, complete with fake blood and a very creepy growl. My friends and I were having a blast, screaming and running in response to the scares. In a moment of playful mischief, I decided to prank this actor. I thought it would be hilarious if I pretended to scream in fear and then suddenly whipped out a fake chainsaw (which I had brought along for our Halloween costumes) and started revving it.

I was genuinely trying to be funny and thought it would be a fun interaction. However, the actor didn’t take it well at all. He dropped character and immediately got angry, telling me that I was ruining the experience for everyone. I was shocked and thought he was overreacting a bit. I mean, it’s a haunted house! I figured everyone would get a kick out of it.

After the haunted house, my friends had mixed reactions. Some thought it was funny and said I was just being playful, while others felt like I should have respected the actor's commitment to his role. The actor, on the other hand, was still visibly upset when we left, and I felt kind of bad seeing him out of character looking frustrated.

In the end, I felt like I had crossed a line when I was just trying to inject some fun into the situation. My friends are divided on whether I went too far or not, but I can’t stop thinking about it. So, am I the asshole for pranking a haunted house actor who was still in character?","This happened last weekend when my friends and I went to a popular haunted house attraction in our town. For context, I (25M) have a pretty close-knit group of friends who enjoy scary movies, haunted houses, and anything that gets our adrenaline pumping. Among us was my friend Sarah (24F), who absolutely loves pranks and always gets a kick out of them.

The haunted house we went to is known for having actors who stay in character no matter what. Halfway through the attraction, one of the actors, dressed as a creepy clown, jumped out and scared the living daylights out of us. We screamed and laughed, but this actor was particularly good and relentless, following us for several rooms.

We were all high on the adrenaline when I had the not-so-brilliant idea to prank him back. I noticed a rubber spider on one of the set pieces. I grabbed it and waited until the actor lunged at us again. When he did, I threw the spider at him and yelled, ""Behind you!"" thinking it'd be hilarious to catch him off guard for once. 

To my surprise, the actor didn't break character but started acting like he was genuinely freaked out by the spider. At first, we were all laughing, but the laughter quickly died down when he sternly told us to move along, clearly annoyed. The mood shifted, and it became apparent that I had crossed a line.

When we got out of the haunted house, some of my friends thought it was funny, but Sarah and a couple of others said I was being rude and disrespectful. Sarah pointed out that these actors work hard to provide a fun experience and that pranking them while they’re doing their job is not cool.

The actor's reaction stuck with me, and I started to feel guilty. I didn't mean to disrupt his performance or make him uncomfortable, but I guess I got carried away by the thrill of the moment. Now I'm worried I might have ruined the experience for everyone and disrespected the actor’s craft.

My family has a big reunion planned at my house next month, and it's something we've all been looking forward to for ages. We usually have a great time catching up, eating good food, and just enjoying each other's company. 

Now, my cousin, who I've always been close to, has a service dog for her anxiety. She’s incredibly proud of it, and I totally understand the importance of service animals in helping people navigate their daily lives. However, my house is not exactly conducive to having a dog around. We have a lot of small children running around—my three kids, plus their cousins—and I worry about the dog being overwhelmed, getting scared, or worse, causing a situation that could endanger any of the kids. 

I initially wanted to be supportive and inclusive, so I asked my cousin about how the dog would fit into the family gathering. She assured me that the dog is well-trained and wouldn't be a problem. But then, I remembered that my youngest child is terrified of dogs. Like, unreasonably so. I thought it would be better to exclude the dog to keep everyone comfortable. 

So, a few weeks ago, I made the decision to send a message to my cousin letting her know that while I appreciate her and her service dog, I felt it would be best for everyone if the dog stayed home for this gathering. I thought I was doing the right thing by putting the needs of my family first. 

When I told my family about my decision, I expected support, but I was met with a mix of disapproval and disappointment. Some family members insisted that service dogs are meant to be with their owners and that excluding the dog was unfair and insensitive. Other relatives, who have seen my cousin's struggles, were more understanding but still felt I could have made an exception.

Now, my cousin is furious with me. She's saying that my decision not only affects her but also sends a message that her needs don’t matter to our family. I genuinely didn't mean to hurt her, and while I thought I was protecting my kids, it seems I've caused a major rift. 

I can understand that I might not have handled it the best way possible, but I still thought I had valid reasons for my decision. So, AITA for banning my cousin's service dog from our family event?","We recently had a big family reunion, something we do every couple of years. It's always a huge deal with everyone coming in from different states. This year, I volunteered to host at my place. Everything was going well until my cousin, Emily, said she'd be bringing her service dog, Max. 

Emily has severe anxiety and Max is trained specifically to help her manage it. I've known about her situation for a while, and while I sympathize, I've also been dealing with my own issues. Over the last year, I developed a pretty bad pet allergy. Even just being around dogs for a short amount of time can set off my allergies, leading to difficulty breathing, hives, and itching. 

So, when she mentioned bringing Max, I got really anxious. I didn't want to risk having an allergic reaction during the reunion. I called Emily and explained my situation, asking if she might be able to manage without Max just for the day. She was upset and said that Max is essential for her to even leave the house most days. I suggested she take some anti-anxiety meds instead, but she said they don't work as well and have side effects she doesn't want to deal with. 

Eventually, I told her that if she couldn't come without Max, then she might need to skip the reunion. Emily was furious and said I was being unreasonable and discriminatory. Some of my other family members felt the same and started messaging me, saying things like I could take allergy meds myself or stay outside if it got too bad. But for me, those aren't practical solutions. I didn't want to be uncomfortable in my own home.

The reunion went ahead without Emily, and it just didn't feel the same. A lot of family members were distant with me, and there was a clear tension in the air. I thought I was just trying to protect myself, but now I'm questioning if I went too far.

Was I an asshole for banning Emily's service dog from our family event?"

We both come from different financial backgrounds; my family is relatively well-off, while Emily's parents have struggled financially for most of their lives. We decided early on that we wanted to cover the majority of the costs ourselves, wanting to keep things simple and affordable. However, as we got deeper into planning, things started to get complicated.

Emily’s parents offered to help with some costs, which we greatly appreciated. However, as they began contributing, they started throwing around ideas of what they wanted, like an extravagant venue that was way out of our budget and certain costly additions that neither of us wanted. Throughout the discussions, I tried to maintain a balance, but it was becoming increasingly clear that they had a vision that didn’t align with ours.

The tipping point came when Emily's mom insisted that we host a lavish rehearsal dinner, despite us having already planned a simple gathering. In frustration, I finally told her that we simply couldn’t accommodate that sort of expense and that we needed to stick to our original budget. She became defensive, claiming we were being ungrateful for their financial support. In my anger, I said I’d rather cover everything myself and uninvited her and her husband from the wedding altogether.

Emily was devastated by my decision. She felt that I had overreacted and that her parents’ intentions were good. I thought I was standing up for what we wanted, but now I’m starting to feel guilty. Our wedding is supposed to be a celebration of our love, not a battleground for disputes over money. 

After talking to a few friends, some said I was justified in wanting to take complete control of our wedding, while others believed I was being insensitive and rash in uninviting them. Emily is caught in the middle, and our relationship feels strained. I can’t shake off the feeling that maybe I went too far. AITA for uninviting my fiancée’s parents from our wedding over a money dispute?","My fiancée, Emily (F28), and I (M30) are getting married in a few months. We've been planning this wedding for over a year, and everything has been mostly smooth sailing until recently. Emily's parents, John (M55) and Carol (F53), have always been supportive of our relationship and offered to contribute financially to the wedding. They generously offered to cover the cost of the catering, which we were very grateful for.

However, last week, John and Carol called us for a serious discussion. They explained that due to some unexpected financial difficulties, they wouldn’t be able to cover the catering expenses anymore. They were very apologetic, but they simply couldn't swing it. I was upset, but I tried to stay calm and told them I understood. Emily was more understanding and suggested we could look for cheaper catering options or scale back the guest list to fit our budget.

I felt that John and Carol should still honor their commitment. After all, we had planned our budget based on their promise. I asked them if they could at least contribute a smaller amount, but they said things were really tight right now and they couldn't commit to anything financially. I felt let down and frustrated. I ended up snapping and told them that if they couldn't support us as they promised, they didn't need to come to the wedding at all.

Emily was horrified by my outburst and immediately tried to calm the situation, but the damage was done. John and Carol left, clearly hurt by my reaction. Since then, Emily and I have been arguing constantly. She thinks I overreacted and that uninviting her parents was a drastic and unnecessary step. She pointed out that they have always been supportive in other ways and that we should empathize with their situation.

Our friends and my family are divided on the issue. My parents think I was right to stand my ground because a promise is a promise. However, many of our friends, and even my sister, think I was way out of line and should apologize. Emily has been distant, and it’s causing a strain on our relationship.

Now, I'm stuck in a mess of my own making. While I still feel hurt and betrayed, I can't ignore the fact that my reaction has greatly impacted everyone involved, especially Emily. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for uninviting my fiancée's parents from our wedding over a money dispute?"

My husband also has a son (8M) from a previous relationship, and while the dynamic has been pretty smooth, I’ve often felt like there's an underlying tension due to his co-parent (let’s call her “Sarah""). 

Sarah and my husband have a complicated history, and while I respect their co-parenting relationship, I can't deny that it sometimes feels like she has a strong influence in our lives. Recently, I learned that Sarah is pregnant with her new partner. Initially, I thought I would just brush it off, but as the news sank in, I found myself feeling upset about it. 

After that, I came across some beautiful matching earrings for both our daughter and her half-brother, and I thought it'd be a lovely way to celebrate their bond. I pictured them wearing those earrings during family events and felt like it would help strengthen their connection. I ended up buying them without discussing it with my husband first. 

When I showed them to him, he was taken aback. He said he thought it was ""inappropriate"" to buy matching jewelry for our daughter and her half-brother when Sarah is pregnant with another child. To him, it felt like I was trying to overshadow that part of their family. I felt hurt and misunderstood; all I wanted was to create a sweet connection between our kids.

In the heat of the moment, he reminded me that our daughter also has a half-sister on the way, and I shot back that those earrings were meant to celebrate her bond with her brother and shouldn't feel like a competition. It escalated into a bigger argument about how we both view the kids’ relationship and what this new pregnancy means for us as a blended family.

Now, both of us are feeling frustrated. I can’t help but feel that my intentions were good, and maybe he was overreacting. But at the same time, I recognize that perhaps I should have discussed it with him first. My friends say I should stand my ground and that my husband is being too sensitive, while his family suggests I should've considered his feelings more. 

So here I am wondering: AITA for being upset about my husband’s co-parent's pregnancy and for buying matching earrings for our child?","My husband, Mark, and I have been married for five years. He has a daughter, Emma (6), from a previous relationship with his co-parent, Lisa. I've always tried to be supportive and respectful of their co-parenting dynamic, but sometimes it feels like my feelings are sidelined.

Recently, Lisa announced that she was pregnant. Apparently, she and her new partner decided to expand their family. When Mark told me, it felt like a punch to the gut. I wasn't mad that she was pregnant, but it stirred up old insecurities. I know it's irrational, but I've always felt a bit threatened by the close bond that Mark, Lisa, and Emma share. It’s like they have this little unit that I’m on the outskirts of, and this new baby amplified that feeling.

In an attempt to bond with Emma and make her feel special amidst all these changes, I bought us matching earrings. Emma was thrilled, and for a moment, it felt like a win. But when Lisa saw the earrings, she was livid. Apparently, she thought it was inappropriate for me to buy something so personal and matching without consulting her first. She felt it was overstepping, asserting that she should be the one doing “firsts” with Emma, like matching jewelry.

Mark took her side, saying he understood where she was coming from and that I should’ve checked with Lisa first. I was frustrated. All I wanted was to make Emma feel special and to have a bonding moment with her. Why should Lisa get to dictate every special moment with Emma?

My friends are divided. Some say I should’ve known better and that Lisa has a right to feel upset, while others think Lisa is being overly sensitive and that I did nothing wrong by trying to connect with my stepdaughter.

The situation has caused a lot of tension. Mark and I had a big argument about it. He thinks I'm not considering Lisa's feelings, while I feel like my efforts to connect with Emma are constantly being scrutinized and undermined. Now, I’m left questioning my actions. Should I have handled this differently?

Am I the asshole for being upset about Lisa's pregnancy and for buying matching earrings for Emma without consulting her?"

I work in a demanding job, and while I usually try to help out around the house and with family responsibilities, there are times when I just need to recharge. 

My wife, on the other hand, has a more flexible schedule and often does a lot of the household chores and caring for our young kids during the day. Lately, whenever I’m relaxing at home on the weekends—like watching a game, catching up on my favorite shows, or even napping—she’ll interrupt me to ask for help with various things. This could be anything from doing chores, helping with the kids, or running errands. When I politely tell her I need some time to myself, she gets upset and accuses me of being lazy or not being a team player.

In contrast, when she has her off time, she fully embraces it. She goes out with her friends or locks herself in the bedroom to binge-watch shows, but if I were to interrupt her with responsibilities, she would turn me down flat, insisting she’s “off-duty” and can’t be disturbed. I’ve brought up how I feel it’s unfair that she expects me to put my time aside while she takes hers for granted, but she insists that her time off needs to be respected because she handles so much during the week.

My friends have mixed opinions about it. Some argue that I should just help out when I can, especially since she often does more around the house. Others think I deserve my downtime and that she needs to understand my need for rest too.

Overall, our disagreements have led to tension between us, and it often ends with her feeling unappreciated. I’m starting to feel that maybe I’m not being fair, even though I feel justified in wanting my time back. 

So, AITA for expecting my wife to respect my “off-duty” time when I don’t feel she does the same for me?","I (34M) work a high-stress job and often find myself completely drained by the end of the day. My wife, Sarah (32F), has a part-time job and also takes care of our two young children, ages 4 and 2. We’ve always agreed that evenings are supposed to be our “off-duty” time where we can unwind and take a breather.

Recently, I’ve found myself needing more space and quiet during my “off-duty” time. Sometimes, I retreat to my home office to play video games or read, just to decompress. When I do this, Sarah continues to handle the kids and household tasks. She’s never complained outright, but she’s been noticeably cold and distant whenever I emerge from my “me-time.”

Last week, I came home particularly exhausted and told her I needed a break. I shut myself in my office for a few hours. When I came out, I found Sarah looking frazzled, trying to juggle the kids’ bedtime routine and finish cleaning up the kitchen. I felt guilty so I offered to help, but she brushed me off, saying she had it under control.

A couple of days later, Sarah had a particularly tough day at work and with the kids. She asked if she could have some time to herself in the evening. I was in the middle of an intense online game and told her to wait until I was done. I figured it wouldn’t take long, but I lost track of time and by the time I was done, she looked about ready to collapse.

My parents visited last weekend, and I mentioned how I’ve been needing more downtime. They suggested that I make sure to reciprocate and give Sarah her own “off-duty” time. When I told them I’m already doing enough by providing for the family, they looked at me like I had two heads.

Sarah’s been giving me the cold shoulder ever since, and now I’m starting to wonder if she’s right to be upset. I thought we had an understanding about our “off-duty” time, but maybe I haven’t been fair in my expectations.

So, AITA for expecting my wife to respect my “off-duty” time when I won’t do the same for her?"

We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :\n\n“i have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.”\n\nI was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)\n\nI guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me. I often mimic people’s personality and humor to fit with them, so after we had been friends for so long we were practically the same person. everyone said that, even our moms. So i thought that since my jokes were basically hers, everything was fine. So am I the asshole?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Complaining About My Father Favoring My Sister in the Will?'""}]","Growing up, it was no secret that my father had a favorite: my younger sister. While I (24M) had always tried to brush it off and convince myself it didn’t bother me, it became more and more evident over the years. She could do no wrong in his eyes, while I often felt like I was the one constantly seeking validation and acknowledgment. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when my father announced he was updating his will. I assumed it would be a fair division or at least some consideration for everything I've done for him over the years. I’m the one who helped him with household repairs, organized events, and generally supported him when he needed someone. But when he revealed the details, I was stunned to find that my sister was set to receive the majority of his inheritance, with me getting a fraction of what she would receive.

Feeling hurt and frustrated, I confronted my father about it. I expressed how I felt that this favoritism was unfair and that I had always been there for him while my sister had not put in the same effort. My father responded defensively, saying that he was doing what he thought was best and that it was his money to distribute as he wished. He accused me of being greedy and ungrateful. It felt like a slap in the face, and I couldn’t help but voice my displeasure.

Now, my father is angry with me, and my sister feels awkward because she overheard our argument. The rest of my family is divided; some sympathize with me, saying it’s natural to feel hurt, while others think I should have kept my mouth shut and just accepted my father's decision gracefully. 

In the aftermath, I feel guilty about how I reacted but also like I have a point. I don’t want to come off as selfish, but it stings to feel sidelined my entire life, only to have that reflected in something as significant as our father's will. 

So, AITA for expressing my feelings about my father favoring my sister in the will?","My father (late 60s) recently passed away, and the reading of his will has stirred up some serious family drama. For context, it's just me (M 35) and my younger sister (F 32). Growing up, we never really had a lot of sibling rivalry, and my dad always seemed to treat us equally - or so I thought. My father owned a small but lucrative business, which he built from the ground up over many years. I work in a completely different field and have never shown any interest in the family business. My sister, however, has been involved in the company since she graduated college and has played a significant role in expanding it.

The will revealed that my father left the business entirely to my sister and split the remaining assets (the house, savings, etc.) equally between us. I felt blindsided and hurt. I confronted my sister, saying it wasn’t fair that she got such a significant portion of his estate while I only got half of the rest. She tried to explain that our father wanted the business to stay in the family and felt she was the natural choice to take over since she’s been managing it for years.

I brought this up with our mother and a few close relatives. Most of them sided with my sister, agreeing that it made sense for her to inherit the business. They pointed out that I have a good job, a stable income, and that my sister worked hard alongside our dad to make the business what it is today. My mother said she understood my feelings but urged me to see it from a practical standpoint.

This has caused some tension between my sister and me. We used to be close, but now things feel strained. She’s frustrated that I’m making this into a big issue and thinks I’m being unfair given the circumstances. I still feel overlooked and undervalued - I’m his son too, after all. The rest of the family thinks I should just accept it and move on, but I can't shake the feeling of being slighted.

Am I the asshole for complaining about my father favoring my sister in the will?"
19,19,AITA for making my (22F) boyfriend's (27M) mother biscuits?,"Long story short, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and, days ago, I finally got to meet his parents (actually, his dad and stepmom, but he considers her as his mom and calls her so), and, as a nice personal gesture, as I love to cook, I decided to bake a batch of biscuits. I met up with his parents, they loved me and I loved them, I gave them the biscuits and they loved the attention, but here's the thing : my boyfriend's parents have been separated for decades now, because of a very sad story that tore their family apart (my bf's bio mom cheated on his dad) and even though he denies it, and doesn't show it, he still resents her for it.

Things have been going really well, and we’ve even started discussing moving in together. However, one significant hurdle has been Jake's relationship with his mother, who has a rocky past, especially with Jake. 

Jake's mom, Susan, cheated on his dad when he was a child, and it has caused a lot of pain for Jake and his family. They have a strained relationship, and while Jake has somewhat forgiven her, he still has a lot of resentment. For the most part, he doesn’t involve her in the major milestones of his life, and I’ve respected his wishes.

Recently, it was Jake’s birthday, and I wanted to surprise him with an amazing gift. I had learned that Susan had also planned to send him something right around the same time. To keep things balanced and make a statement, I thought it might be nice to send Susan a small gift as well, as a way to mend the bridge a little. 

I bought her a lovely plant and a handwritten note, expressing that I hoped she was doing well and that ""someday, maybe they could work on their relationship."" I thought this would show a sense of goodwill, and I wanted to treat her equally, given that all families come with their own baggage.

When Jake found out, he was furious. He felt that I was undermining his feelings about his mother and that this was inappropriate given her past actions. He said that I was being naïve and didn’t understand the depth of their issues. After our argument, he ended up telling me that I was disrespecting his family by trying to “normalize” his mother’s behavior.

Now, I’m second-guessing myself. I genuinely thought it was a kind gesture and a way to show that I care about both of them. But Jake’s reaction made me wonder if I overstepped. Am I the asshole for trying to treat my boyfriend's cheating mother equally by giving her gifts?","So, my boyfriend (25M) and I (24F) have been together for three years now. We decided to move in together last year, and things have been mostly great. The only real issue in our relationship has been his mother. She never liked me from the beginning, always making passive-aggressive comments and undermining our relationship.

A little background: My boyfriend’s parents separated when he was a teenager because his mother cheated on his father. This caused a lot of tension within the family, but my boyfriend has tried to maintain a relationship with both of his parents. His father remarried and moved on, while his mother has remained single and somewhat bitter.

For my boyfriend’s birthday this year, I decided to give gifts to both of his parents as a gesture of goodwill. I thought it would help smooth things over with his mother and show her that I want to be part of their family. I spent quite a bit of time picking out thoughtful presents: a nice watch for his father and a beautiful handmade scarf for his mother. I even included a heartfelt note with each gift.

When my boyfriend’s mother received her gift, she was furious. She accused me of trying to buy her forgiveness and manipulate my way into the family. She said she found my gesture insulting and disrespectful given the history of her infidelity. She also took to social media to vent her frustrations, which made the whole situation public and incredibly awkward.

My boyfriend was caught in the middle, and while he appreciated my effort, he said I should have known better than to try and “balance the scales” with his mother. He thinks my actions were well-intentioned but ultimately misguided and insensitive.

Most of our friends and family agree with my boyfriend, saying that my gesture was tone-deaf considering the history between his parents. But a small group of my close friends believe I was just trying to be kind and that his mother overreacted.

Since then, my relationship with his mother has deteriorated even further, and it’s causing tension between my boyfriend and me. I genuinely thought I was doing something nice, but now I’m questioning if I went about it the wrong way. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to treat my boyfriend’s cheating mother equally by giving her gifts?"

On the way, Fred and Amy get into an argument about how rent is paid (we all venmo Fred and then he pays our landlord.

I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story.

I could give you a play by play of the exact argument, but I think it's safe to say neither handled it well and it escalated quickly to yelling and vitriol. I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story. I asked them both to be quiet and essentially said: I can see there's a miscommunication, it's not appropriate or productive to keep yelling mean things so knock it off. They were both eventually able to stop and don't speak for the rest of the ride.  He drops us off and parks the car. They don't speak in line but both speak with me normally. When we're settled, he says he doesn't want to sit by Amy and goes off to sit by himself, indicating I should go with him.  Here's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: I had set up the blanket and we were expecting our friends. I felt like it was an escalation to take a stand and go sit alone with Fred rather than for Amy and Fred to continue to keep distance and resolve at a later time. While it was super clear that Amy started the original rent issue by refusing to communicate, neither handled it well and I was upset with both of them.  I went off to call a friend and vent. Fred came up to me and insisted I go sit with him or he was going to leave and take the car with him, leaving Amy and I to find our own way home. He said he wouldn't tolerate being treated like this (a common feeling he has about Amy) and needed me to take a stand with him. I felt like he was putting me between a rock and a hard place. I told him explicitly, repeatedly, that I agreed with him, side with him, know it's wrong, and just don't agree with his actions handling it after the fact. I think he felt betrayed and like I wasn't taking his side.  I was able to convince him to leave me the car because I felt that was kind of rude, and he went home on his own.

We've been living together for about a year now, and for the most part, we get along well. However, recently there’s been some tension between Alex and my girlfriend, and things took a turn during a recent argument.

The situation began when my girlfriend decided to host a small gathering at our place for her birthday. She planned it out and made sure to communicate to both Alex and me what she wanted—just a few friends over, snacks, and some games. Alex, however, had a different idea. He insisted that it would be a great opportunity for him to invite some of his friends over as well. He didn't run this by my girlfriend, and when she found out, she felt very overwhelmed. 

I tried to talk to Alex and explain that this was my girlfriend’s special day, and he shouldn't invite people without consulting her first. He brushed me off and said it was “just friends hanging out” and that I was overreacting, which frustrated me. I stood my ground, and ultimately, I told Alex that if he didn't respect my girlfriend's wishes, I would have to ask him to leave for the night.

When the day of the party arrived, Alex seemed visibly upset, sulking in his room while my girlfriend and her friends enjoyed themselves. He later confronted me about taking her side over him, claiming that I was being unfair and that he felt excluded from our friend group. I reassured him that it wasn't about excluding him but rather about respecting my girlfriend’s birthday and what she wanted for her celebration.

Afterward, it felt like I had a target on my back. Alex has since been cold towards my girlfriend and me, and it makes living together awkward. Some mutual friends think I should have been more accommodating to Alex and that I shouldn't have put my girlfriend's needs above his. Others support my decision, stating that it was her birthday, and I had every right to stand by my partner.

Now I’m left feeling conflicted. Did I overstep by taking my girlfriend’s side rather than trying to find a compromise? AITA for siding with her on this?","My roommate, Alex, and I have been living together for about a year, and things have generally been good. We're both in our mid-twenties and work similar hours, so we have a comfortable routine. A couple of months ago, I started dating Sarah, and things got serious pretty quickly. She's at our apartment quite often, to the extent that she's almost a third roommate now.

Here’s where the problem started. Alex has some quirks. He is very particular about his things and personal space. He's always been clear about boundaries, which I’ve respected. However, Sarah has a tendency to move things around, borrow stuff without asking, and just generally make herself at home. I've talked to her about it, but she says she forgets and doesn't think it's a big deal.

A couple of weeks ago, Alex came home to find Sarah had rearranged the living room to make more space for a get-together we were having. He was visibly upset but didn’t say anything in front of Sarah. After she left, he confronted me, saying he felt disrespected in his own home. I felt caught in the middle because, on one hand, Sarah didn't mean any harm; she just wanted to make the space more comfortable for us and our friends. On the other hand, I understood Alex’s frustration. 

I tried to smooth things over by telling Alex it wasn’t a big deal and we’d put everything back the way it was. This did not go over well. He said I was dismissing his feelings and taking Sarah’s side because I didn’t want to upset her. He’s been distant and cold ever since, and I know it’s because he feels like I’m not respecting him or his space.

Some mutual friends have said that Alex is overreacting and needs to lighten up because he can be a bit uptight. Others have said that it's not fair to him to have someone constantly in his space, doing things he’s not comfortable with. Sarah doesn't think she did anything wrong and says she refuses to tiptoe around in an apartment that's also mine.

Currently, the tension is through the roof. Alex avoids common areas when Sarah is around, and it’s making living together really uncomfortable. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Alex, but I also don’t want Sarah to feel unwelcome.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for taking my partner's side over my roommate’s behavior?"

To give you some background, we had a pretty rough childhood and my relationship with our father was complicated. After years of tension and fighting, I ultimately cut ties with him and have been trying to move on. I’ve spent a lot of time healing from our family's past.

Recently, Sarah had a baby, and I heard through the family grapevine that she named her daughter after our dad. I was shocked—not only because we haven't spoken much in recent years, but also because naming her baby after someone who caused us both a lot of pain felt like a huge betrayal. It felt like all the progress I’ve made in healing was being overshadowed by this decision.

When I got the news, I admit I reacted pretty poorly. I expressed my feelings to some family members, saying it was insensitive and hurtful. They all seemed to be on Sarah’s side, saying she had every right to name her child whatever she wanted and that I was being selfish for thinking otherwise. Even our mom chimed in, saying that I should be happy for Sarah and that my feelings about our dad shouldn’t overshadow her joy of becoming a parent.

I know I probably could have handled my emotions differently, but it felt so personal to me. I confronted Sarah directly, letting her know how upset I was about the name choice. She was hurt and told me I was being dramatic. She said that she felt like naming her daughter after our dad might help bridge some of the family gaps and create a new legacy. 

Now, I’m grappling with whether I overreacted or if I had a right to be upset considering our shared history. My friends are split on this—some say I should just let it go and focus on the positive, while others agree with me that it was inconsiderate to name her child after someone who had hurt us both. 

So, AITA for being upset that Sarah named her baby after our dad without asking me first?","I (29F) have been estranged from my sister, Jessica (33F), for about six years. Our relationship fell apart after a huge family fallout involving our dad. When our parents divorced, Jessica sided with our mom, and I sided with our dad. Things got messy, and we hadn't spoken since.

A few months ago, I heard from a cousin that Jessica had a baby boy and named him Michael, after our dad, who passed away two years ago. This really stung. Our dad and I were super close, and I felt like honoring him in this way should have involved me in some way.

I reached out to Jessica to express my feelings, but it didn't go well. I told her that naming her baby after our dad felt like a betrayal since she hadn't been in contact with him or me for years. I felt like it was my right to have a say in how our dad's memory should be carried on in the family.

Jessica was taken aback and told me that she named her son after our dad not to upset me but to honor him in her own way. She said that despite the estrangement, he was still her father too and she had the right to name her child whatever she wanted. She also pointed out that she didn't need my permission.

Our mom and other family members are divided. Some think that Jessica should have considered my feelings and at least given me a heads-up. Others think I'm overreacting and that Jessica didn't do anything wrong. My husband thinks I'm being too sensitive and that it’s Jessica's right as a mother to name her child as she sees fit.

Since then, Jessica and I had another heated exchange and haven’t spoken. I know our relationship is strained, but I just can't shake the feeling of being hurt and left out.

During Covid Theo (25ish M) joined our crew. In the 2 years we have known him, he has NEVER mentioned a spouse. He’s talked about friends and family, his favorite things, what he’s cooking for dinner, everything but that and kind of made himself sound single. A couple of coworkers even asked him out but he declined because he doesn’t date coworkers. I can’t deny he’s VERY good looking which attracted a lot of interest from coworkers.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was walking home from grocery shopping near work and my bag split. A woman help pick up everything and even offered her tote. We chatted and it turns out she was Theo’s WIFE. They had been married for 3 years so before he even started this job. When I introduced myself as Theo’s coworker, it was clear Theo had told her about work and us but I don’t think she realized that we didn’t know she even existed.\n\nWhen I went to work, I casually asked Theo if he was seeing anyone and he shrugged and said work was too busy. I thought it was weird he wouldn’t mention his wife so I messaged her and said we needed to talk.\n\nWe met later at a cafe and I told her that no one knew who she was because Theo never mentioned her. I talked about how women would flirt with him. I mentioned he never wore a wedding ring. She started blinking hard as if trying not to cry. She looked crushed. But she was a sweetheart and paid for my coffee before I even got a chance to.\n\nThe past few days Theo has been very moody. He started buying lunch instead of bringing one from home. He’s been ignoring me which interferes in our work. He cornered me today after work and told me that his wife was sad and he didn’t know why but it was my fault. He told me to never contact his wife or talk about her again. I told my coworkers what happened and everyone expressed shock that he had a wife. A few coworkers said I was an asshole for telling my coworker’s wife that he hid her existence but most took my side. My boyfriend said I was in the right and people would want to know if their spouse was acting shady like Theo.\n\nEdit: is it not normal to chat with people evenif its strangers?

I invited a few close friends, including my longtime friend Sarah (26F). We've been friends since college, and while we have a great time together, there’s always been a slight competitive edge between us. 

The night was going well. We were playing games, laughing, and enjoying drinks. I made sure to set clear boundaries about the space—no food or drinks near the electronics, and we were all respectful of that. Sarah, however, kept insisting on staying near the snacks while using her MacBook. I reminded her a couple of times to be careful since things were getting a bit rowdy, but she brushed it off and said she was fine.

As the night progressed, things got a little out of hand. We were playing a party game that involved tossing a ball around, and somehow, during a particularly enthusiastic throw, the ball hit Sarah’s laptop, knocking it off the table. I felt terrible, but the screen shattered on impact. It was a horrible sound, and everyone went quiet.

After the shock wore off, Sarah started to freak out. She was upset, and I completely understood why, but honestly, I felt a bit frustrated too. I told her in the moment that it was somewhat her fault for not being more careful with her laptop while in a chaotic environment. I should have been more supportive, but I couldn't help but point out that she had the opportunity to move her laptop away from the snack area where the ball was flying.

Since then, things have been rocky between us. Sarah has been distant, and when I reached out to check in, she told me I should have been more responsible as a host and that my blame was unfair. A few other friends have also said I shouldn’t have said anything, insisting that accidents happen and that I should have just helped her instead.

Now I’m left wondering if I did cross a line. I definitely didn’t mean to ruin the night or the friendship, but I felt her lack of caution was a contributing factor. Am I the asshole for blaming my friend for damaging her own MacBook at my party?","Last weekend, I (24F) hosted a small party at my apartment. It wasn’t anything crazy, just some close friends, drinks, and music. My friend Emma (23F) brought her MacBook along because she needed to finish some work before the deadline. She asked if it was okay if she sat at the dining table and wrapped it up during the party, and I said sure, no problem.

As the night went on, the party got a bit livelier. People started dancing and moving around more, and there were drinks everywhere. At one point, a couple of friends were horsing around near the dining table. One of them accidentally bumped into the table, causing a drink to spill all over Emma's MacBook. Emma freaked out, and understandably so. She tried to dry it off, but it wouldn’t turn back on. She was really upset and said she needed it for an important project.

Here’s where things got tense. I told Emma that she should have known better than to bring something so valuable to a party where drinks would be spilled. I pointed out that it was kind of her fault for leaving it out in the open. Emma was furious and accused me of being insensitive and not taking responsibility for my party. I tried to explain that it was just bad luck and that it could have been avoided if she hadn't brought the MacBook, but she wasn’t having it.

Now, Emma isn’t talking to me, and a few of our mutual friends are siding with her, saying that I should have been more apologetic and considerate. Some others agree with me, saying it was a party and accidents happen, and Emma should have been more cautious with her laptop.

I feel bad that her MacBook got ruined, but I still think it wasn’t entirely my fault. It’s not like I spilled the drink myself. However, the fallout from this incident is making me question whether I handled the situation correctly.

Am I the asshole for blaming my friend for damaging her own MacBook at my party?"

Lila is health-conscious, and she's always been vocal about her feelings on smoking. I get it; she doesn’t like it, but I’ve been smoking for a long time and it’s something I enjoy. I’ve tried to cut back after she voiced her concerns, and I can definitely see the appeal of leading a healthier lifestyle, but I also feel like I shouldn't have to completely give it up just because she doesn't like it.

Recently, we were hanging out on a lazy Sunday afternoon when Lila casually brought up my smoking habit again. She made a comment about how she thinks it’s ""gross"" and that I really should consider quitting for my health and for our future together. Honestly, I felt like she was lecturing me, and instead of taking it calmly, I responded with a sarcastic remark. I said something like, ""Sure, let me just throw out my smokes and start running marathons instead, right?"" I thought I was being funny, but she didn't take it that way.

Her face just dropped, and she got really upset, saying I was making light of an issue that really bothers her. I tried to explain I was just joking, but she was too hurt to see the humor in it. We ended up in a bit of an argument; I felt like she was overreacting while she thought I was being dismissive of her feelings.

Afterwards, some of our mutual friends weighed in. They suggested that while I may have been trying to be funny, it was inappropriate given the seriousness of the topic for Lila. They felt I should have been more understanding about her concerns, and that my sarcasm was out of line. I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I also think she could have approached the conversation more gently.

Now, I'm left feeling confused. I see both sides, but I feel like I was just trying to lighten the mood. I didn't think my response warranted the level of anger she showed. So, AITA for being sarcastic when my girlfriend brought up my smoking habit?","I've been dating ""Emily"" for about a year now, and things have been going great for the most part. However, there's one issue that keeps coming up: my smoking habit. I've been smoking for about ten years, and while I know it's not the healthiest choice, it's something that helps me relax and unwind.

Emily has always been clear about her dislike for smoking, but she knew I smoked when we started dating. She's been gently encouraging me to quit, giving me articles about the health risks, and even suggesting alternatives like nicotine patches or vaping. I appreciated her concern but didn't commit to anything because, in all honesty, I wasn't ready to quit.

The other night, we were having dinner at my place, and out of nowhere, Emily started talking about how her uncle had recently quit smoking after years of trying. She went on about how much healthier and happier he seemed, and how proud his family was of him. At this point, I was feeling a bit defensive, so I sarcastically said, ""Well, good for him. Maybe I should just quit right now and become everyone's hero.""

Emily looked hurt and stopped talking about it. The rest of the dinner was awkward, and she left shortly after. I thought it was just a small tiff, but the next day she texted me saying she was really disappointed in my reaction and felt like I didn't take her concerns seriously. She mentioned that health is important to her, and she couldn't understand why I was so dismissive.

I told my buddies about it, expecting them to back me up, but even they were like, ""Dude, she cares about you. Maybe you were a bit of a jerk."" My family, who knows how stubborn I can be about my smoking, also said I should apologize and try to see things from her perspective.

Emily and I haven't talked much since that night, and I can tell she's still upset. I get that she wants the best for me, but I felt ambushed and defensive. 

Am I the asshole for being sarcastic when my girlfriend brought up my smoking habit?"

I understand that he is not objectively doing anything wrong - I told him he could crash for free for three weeks and he has been splitting all the bills.

I’ve had this friend, Jake, stay with me for a couple of months. He was going through a rough patch—lost his job, broke up with his girlfriend, and needed a place to crash while he got back on his feet. I was more than happy to help him out, and honestly, it felt great to be there for someone in need. I didn’t charge him rent or anything, and I even let him use my food and household supplies freely.

Recently, I had a couple of friends over for dinner, and we had a nice spread. Jake tagged along and seemed to enjoy himself. As the night went on and we all ate, I casually mentioned that since he was living with me rent-free, I thought it would be nice if he could treat me to dinner next time we went out—just to balance things a bit. I thought it was a reasonable request since I have been helping him out, and I figured it would show he appreciated my hospitality.

Well, things quickly went south. Jake got visibly upset and mentioned that he felt like I was keeping score and that asking him to treat me was inappropriate given his financial situation. I was taken aback; I thought I was just making a friendly suggestion. I didn’t mean it as a demand, and I genuinely didn’t expect him to take me out to a fancy dinner right away, but maybe a casual meal once he was stabilized.

After our conversation, I reached out to a few friends for their opinions. To my surprise, most of them said that I was in the wrong for expecting something in return, even if I didn’t explicitly ask for it. They argued that hospitality should come without strings attached, and I shouldn't be keeping track of favors. 

Now, Jake feels awkward around me, and I sense a rift forming. I keep flaring up with regret for bringing it up and feeling like I've put him in a tough spot. I’ve realized that my intentions may not have come across as I wanted them to. I was just hoping it would lead to some reciprocity down the line without making it a transactional friendship.

So, based on all this, I’m starting to think I might have misjudged the situation. Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to treat me to dinner after letting him stay with me for free?","So, my friend Alex has been staying at my place for the last couple of weeks. He's going through a rough patch, lost his job, and needed a place to crash while he gets back on his feet. I've known Alex for years, and he's always been a good friend, so I didn't think twice about letting him stay with me rent-free.

The past few weeks have been okay for the most part, but I've been covering all the household expenses, from groceries to utilities. I didn't mind it much at first, but it started to get a bit frustrating. I felt like he wasn't even trying to contribute in any way. He would sleep in late, play video games, and didn't help around the house.

A few nights ago, I suggested we go out for dinner. I picked a reasonably priced place, not too fancy, but not a fast-food joint either. When the bill came, I kind of expected Alex to at least offer to pay since he's been living here for free. But he didn't. He just sat there, waiting for me to pick up the tab. Feeling annoyed and a bit hurt, I didn't say anything, but I paid for the meal.

The next day, I calmly brought it up to Alex. I told him that I felt a bit taken advantage of, and that it would have been nice if he had offered to treat me to dinner as a thank-you for letting him stay with me. He got really defensive and said that he didn't have any money, and that's why he's crashing at my place in the first place. He accused me of being insensitive to his situation and said I wasn't being a good friend.

Our mutual friends are split on this. Some of them think I was being reasonable and that it's not too much to ask for a little appreciation. Others think I was being a jerk for expecting anything from someone who's clearly struggling.

Alex has since found another place to stay, and we're not on great terms right now. I'm starting to feel like I might have been too harsh and not understanding enough of his situation. Maybe I should have approached it differently. 

So, am I the asshole for expecting Alex to treat me to dinner after he’s been staying with me for free?"

Earlier this year, my friend Sam invited me over to check out some art items they had imported from abroad. Sam is really passionate about art, and these pieces were their pride and joy. They had talked about them for weeks before my visit, and I could tell how much they meant to Sam.

When I arrived, I was a little distracted and not paying full attention to my surroundings. I was in the middle of a conversation with Sam about their collection when I accidentally bumped into a display table. Before I knew it, I had knocked over one of the imported sculptures. It shattered into pieces, and I was horrified. I immediately apologized and felt terrible about what happened.

Sam was understandably upset. We both knew that the sculpture was irreplaceable and had cost a significant amount of money. I tried to comfort Sam and reassured them that I would make it right. I told them I would be willing to cover the cost of the sculpture, but when Sam told me the total loss was around $3,000, I started to feel uneasy. 

I suggested to Sam that I could pay half, which I felt was fair considering my carelessness, but they insisted that since the item was mine to begin with and I had knocked it over, I should pay for the full cost. This was a big blow to my budget, and I felt it was excessive considering it was an accident.

Our mutual friends are split on this. Some think I should pay the full amount since it was my fault, while others believe that accidents happen and that I shouldn’t be held fully responsible for a mistake. As Sam and I continued to discuss this, things got heated, and our friendship became strained.

Now, I feel guilty about the situation, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to bear such a huge financial burden for a mistake that wasn’t intentional. Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to cover part of the loss instead of the full amount?","This is a bit of a long story, but I need some unbiased opinions. My friend, Alex, and I have known each other since college, and we both have a love for unique, imported goods. Alex recently took a trip overseas and brought back a few delicate, handmade items that he was really excited about. He asked if he could leave them at my place for a couple of days since he was moving and didn’t want them damaged in the process. Naturally, I agreed—what are friends for, right?

The items were packed in a sturdy-looking box, and he even warned me to be careful with them. I had to clean up my place a bit and decided to move the box to a safer spot. As I was doing so, I got distracted by my phone. I set the box down carelessly on the edge of the coffee table, and as fate would have it, it tumbled off onto the floor. I heard a distinct shattering sound and immediately felt my heart sink. 

When I opened the box, I found that one of the items was completely broken beyond repair. The rest had minor damages. I felt awful but didn’t think it was the end of the world. I called Alex to tell him what happened, expecting him to be upset but understanding. To my surprise, he was livid. He told me that the broken item was a rare piece that he paid a lot for, and the others were almost just as valuable. 

He asked me to pay for the full cost of the damaged goods, which amounted to a few thousand dollars. I was taken aback. I admitted that I was careless but didn’t think I should have to foot the entire bill. I offered to pay half, thinking that was reasonable given that it was an accident. Alex, however, insisted that since it was my carelessness, I should pay the full amount.

We went back and forth about it, and now our friendship is on shaky ground. My other friends are divided. Some say I should suck it up and pay because it was my fault, while others say Alex should have known the risks of leaving such valuable items with someone else. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

What complicates things further is that Alex isn’t exactly rolling in money right now, and this loss hits him hard. I get that, but a few thousand dollars is a lot for me too. I don't want to lose a friend over this, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m being extorted for money.

So, AITA for expecting Alex to share the financial burden of the broken imported items?"

I was completely blown away by their thoughtfulness and how much they had spent on me. In the past, we’ve always exchanged gifts, but this was on another level.

The problem started when I realized how expensive their gift was. I felt guilty receiving something so elaborate, especially since it seemed like they had stretched their budget. I'm not one to expect big presents and I would have been just as happy with a small token or spending quality time together. My cousins, however, have always been quite successful and have the means to splurge a little more on gifts. 

After mulling it over for a few days, I decided that it would be best to return the gift. I didn't think it was fair for them to spend that much money on me, and I didn't want to feel indebted to them. I reached out to them and explained my feelings, offering to return the gaming console and games so they could recoup their money. I figured it was a sensible move, especially since I didn’t want to make them feel obligated to spend so much on me in the future.

To my surprise, they were not pleased at all. My cousins expressed their frustration and disappointment, saying that they gave me the gift because they genuinely wanted to celebrate me, not because they expected anything in return. They insisted that it was meant to bring joy and that I was taking away that joy by returning it. They also stressed that they enjoyed giving extravagant gifts and that it wasn't a burden for them at all.

I honestly thought I was doing the right thing by refusing such an expensive present, but now it seems I may have offended them. They’ve started avoiding my calls and haven’t been as engaged in our group chats. My family members have also chimed in, saying I overreacted and that I should have graciously accepted the gift instead of trying to return it.

So, now I’m left wondering if I was wrong to send the gift back. AITA for returning the expensive gift money to my cousins?","I recently celebrated my 30th birthday and had a small get-together with close family and friends. It was a lovely evening, and I appreciated everyone who took the time to come. My cousins, who are very well-off financially, surprised me with a very expensive gift—a high-end designer watch. I was taken aback by their generosity and felt uncomfortable with the extravagant gift, considering that my financial situation is nowhere near theirs.

To give you some background, my cousins and I have always had a good relationship, but we come from very different economic backgrounds. They are used to lavish spending and grand gestures, while I am much more frugal in my lifestyle. I always make a point to give thoughtful but modest gifts, and it has never been an issue until now.

After some thought, I decided to return the watch to them along with a heartfelt note explaining my discomfort with accepting such an expensive gift. I also included a check for an amount that I felt was more reasonable, closer to what I could afford to spend on them.

When my cousins received the returned gift and the check, they were visibly hurt and offended. They called me and said they had chosen the watch specifically for me, knowing it would suit my tastes and lifestyle. They said the gesture was meant to show their appreciation and love, and that returning it felt like I was rejecting their feelings. They insisted they could afford it and that it was not a big deal for them at all.

My parents and siblings also weighed in. My mom thought it was a considerate move on my part to return the gift because she knows I hate feeling indebted to anyone. My dad, on the other hand, said I should have just accepted it graciously. My siblings were split; one understood my discomfort, while the other thought I was making too much of it.

The fallout has been awkward. My cousins have started to distance themselves from me a bit, and I can sense the tension whenever we interact. The last thing I wanted was to cause a rift in our relationship over a material gift, but here we are.

So, am I the asshole for returning the gift money to my cousins after they gave me an expensive gift?"
27,27,AITA for humiliating MIL at a family dinner when she wouldn't stop going on about grandchildren?,"Please don't post this elsewhere (aka tiktok, YouTube).  I (27f) haven't gotten along with my MIL for the better part of my relationship with my partner (27m). She has said a lot of mean things about me that are honestly just childish and cruel (I won't get into the he said she said stuff). I've become exhausted with her, especially as I've moved into my career, moved town and am in the process of getting married/ buying a house.

My partner asked her to stop several times but she kept bringing it up. I was sat there silent for a bit, but I think the wine got the best of me so I kinda snapped. I turned to her and started asking what she wants to know about our *private* life?? What kind of protection we're using, what positions we've tried, what toys we use. I started to list them all. Lets just say I used very inappropriate language for a dinner table, even throwing in a ""do you have any pointers for me, or maybe it'd be best if you just came and watched to make sure we're doing it right"". At this point she was yelling at me, having a go at my partner for ""letting"" me speak to her like that and crying about how mean I am. We got up shortly after and left.

My partner blocked her after that. I know a few people suggested I just tell her I'm infertile, but the way she weaponises information is honestly terrifying.

At first, I tried to be accommodating, but her invasive questions and snide comments have increasingly made me uncomfortable. Although I’ve brought up my feelings to my husband, he always says she means well but can be a bit much.

Recently, we had a family gathering where my in-laws were present. While we were all eating, my mother-in-law started probing into our plans for having kids. I’ve been open about wanting to take my time, but she doesn’t respect that and continually presses the issue. She also goes so far as to ask personal questions about my reproductive health, which feels really inappropriate. 

That day, after the fourth or fifth question, I finally snapped. I told her that I find her inquiries invasive and that it was none of her business. I regretted my tone almost immediately, as the table fell silent. My husband looked shocked, and his parents exchanged glances. For a moment, I felt a rush of relief for standing up for myself, but it quickly turned into discomfort when I realized I might have crossed a line. 

Afterward, my husband gently told me that while he understands where I was coming from, the way I addressed it could have been more tactful. He said it upset his mom, who has always been sensitive and that I shouldn’t have escalated things like that. On the other hand, his sister supported me and said someone needed to call out their mother for her behavior.

In the days following, my mother-in-law has barely reached out to me. I feel bad for potentially hurting her feelings but also believe that my boundaries deserve respect. It’s a complicated situation, and I’m torn about how to handle things moving forward. 

So, AITA for calling out my mother-in-law’s invasive behavior and standing up against what I see as emotional abuse, despite the way I did it?","I (32F) have been married to my husband (34M) for five years. His mother (MIL, 58F) has always been a bit overbearing and intrusive, but recently it's gotten worse. My husband is an only child, so she tends to be extremely involved in our lives, often crossing boundaries that should be respected.

A few months ago, we started trying for a baby. We didn't tell anyone because we didn't want the added pressure, but somehow my MIL found out. Since then, she has been incessantly asking invasive questions about our sex life, fertility treatments, and even suggesting ""remedies"" and ""rituals"" that she believes would help us conceive. I’ve repeatedly asked her to stop, but she just won't listen. This constant intrusion is really taking a toll on me.

Last week, we had a family dinner, and she brought up the topic again in front of everyone, asking if we had ""finally done it successfully."" I lost my cool and finally called her out, telling her that her questions were invasive and disrespectful, and that her constant badgering about our private life was bordering on emotional abuse. She got very upset, started crying, and left the room.

My husband supports me in private but says I could have handled the situation more tactfully. He believes his mother means well and that I should have had a private conversation with her instead of calling her out in front of everyone. My own parents think I should have set boundaries earlier and stood firm, but they agree that my outburst was over the top

Since the incident, my MIL has been sending passive-aggressive texts and has even involved other family members, painting herself as the victim of my ""unprovoked"" attack. The family is now divided, with some taking her side and others thinking I did the right thing by standing up for myself.

My relationship with my husband has also taken a hit. While he understands my frustration, he thinks I should apologize for the public confrontation. I, on the other hand, think MIL needed to be called out for her invasive behavior and that maybe this was the only way to make her understand. 

So, AITA for calling out my mother-in-law's invasive questions and standing up to her emotional abuse?"
28,28,AITA for wanting to bring a nerf gun during trick or treating?,"So I'm a 21 F and I absolutely love Halloween, I try to spend as much time as I can when it comes to my costumes, mostly the props since sewing is too advanced for me, and this year I decided to be a triangle guard from squid game because ever since it came out last year I had wanted to be a character from it because I love the show.  Now, I'm too old to go trick or treating by myself without it seeming questionable but I have some step siblings, the oldest of them is married with a kid in middle school and they're not from the country so they never really got to go trick or treating and I wanted to give the kid a fun experience.

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I’m the asshole I get it.

For Halloween this year, I decided to take my love for them to the next level by customizing a nerf gun to make it look super cool. I spent hours painting it, adding some creative details, and honestly, I was really proud of my work. It was all in good fun, and I thought it would be an awesome accessory for my costume.

I showed my idea to my parents, expecting them to be just as excited as I was. Instead, they totally freaked out. They said that bringing something that looked so realistic, even though it’s just a nerf gun, could make people uncomfortable or even scared, especially with everything going on in the world. They were really concerned that it could be perceived as a real weapon and that I’d get in trouble or face backlash.

I tried to explain that it’s just a nerf gun and that everyone would understand it was for Halloween, but they wouldn’t budge. They were adamant about not letting me take it to school. I felt like they were being overly cautious and not allowing me to express myself. Halloween is supposed to be fun and creative, right? 

In a moment of frustration, I decided to go to school with the nerf gun anyway. I thought that once my friends saw it, they’d all appreciate the effort I put into customizing it and that teachers would understand it was just meant for Halloween fun. When I got to school, my friends loved it, but some teachers were not impressed. They ended up taking the nerf gun and I got called into the principal's office. 

Now, I’ve gotten in trouble for defying my parents and bringing the gun to school. My friends think it was awesome and say my parents are being overprotective, but I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I did cross a line. I reached out to my parents later, and they were furious, saying I put myself in danger of facing serious consequences. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to bring my custom nerf gun to school for Halloween, despite my parents’ concerns? I thought I was just trying to have fun, but now I’m questioning if I mishandled the whole situation.","Alright, I know this might sound a bit crazy, but I need some perspective. My high school is having a Halloween costume contest, and I wanted to go all out this year. I've been working on this really badass custom Nerf gun for my costume. It’s painted and modified to look super cool and realistic—think sci-fi blaster vibes. I admit, it looks pretty authentic, which is why my parents are freaking out.

They think bringing it to school is a terrible idea. My dad even said it could get me suspended or worse, and my mom is worried that someone might see it and think it's a real weapon. But it’s a Nerf gun! I mean, it's orange and blue underneath the paint, and it's supposed to be fun, right? I don’t see the harm in it, especially since it’s not like I would be using it for anything other than the costume contest.

My school is usually pretty relaxed about Halloween costumes. Last year, one kid came dressed up as a soldier with a toy rifle, and no one seemed to care. I tried to use this as an example, but my parents wouldn't budge. They even suggested I leave the blaster at home and just go with the rest of the costume, but the whole thing is based around this prop. It won't make any sense without it.

I argued that if I explain to the teachers and principal beforehand, they would understand it's just a part of the costume. But my parents are concerned about setting a bad precedent or causing unnecessary panic, especially in today's climate. They worry that even if I get permission, it might still upset some people or spark a negative reaction.

So now I'm stuck. The costume I’ve been working on for weeks feels incomplete without the Nerf gun, and I really don’t want to bail on my idea. I think they're overreacting and being paranoid. Plus, Halloween is supposed to be fun and creative! 

My friends are split on this. Some think my parents are being reasonable given the nature of the prop, while others agree with me that it's not a big deal and I should go for it.

Am I the asshole for wanting to bring my custom Nerf gun to school, despite my parents' concerns?"

Growing up, we had a cat named Whiskers who was with us for 16 years. He was more than just a pet; he was part of our family. We all took care of him, and when he passed away just five days ago, it hit us hard. My kids were devastated, and I was personally heartbroken. We spent the week reminiscing about all the good times we had with him and trying to comfort each other.

A few days after his passing, my stepmom came over and shocked us all by bringing home a new kitten. She was clearly excited about it, but I couldn’t help but feel disgusted and hurt. To me, it felt like she was trying to replace Whiskers, and it seemed incredibly insensitive given how fresh our grief was. I voiced my feelings, telling her that it felt too soon to be welcoming a new pet into the house when we were still mourning the loss of our beloved cat.

My stepmom argued that she thought it would help to have a new pet around to bring some joy back into the house. She loves animals and thought that having a playful kitten would lift our spirits. I get her intentions, but all I could think about was how our family was still hurting and needed time to heal. Conversations quickly turned into a debate, and other family members ended up weighing in. Some sided with my stepmom, saying we should welcome the new kitten as part of moving on, while others understood my perspective of wanting to honor Whiskers.

As of now, there’s a bit of tension in the family. My stepmom feels frustrated and thinks I’m being unreasonable, while I just feel upset about the timing. It’s not that I dislike the kitten; I just think it’s too soon.

So, am I the asshole for being disgusted by my stepmom's decision to get a new kitten just days after our cat passed away?","Last week, my family's beloved cat, Whiskers, passed away after being with us for 12 wonderful years. It was a sudden loss and very hard on all of us, especially me since Whiskers had been my constant companion since childhood. My dad remarried about two years ago, and I've been living with him and my stepmom since then. We’ve had a decent relationship, though we’re not super close.

Just five days after Whiskers passed away, my stepmom came home with a new kitten. She seemed really excited and named it Muffin. But I was completely taken aback and frankly a bit disgusted. It felt like Whiskers had just been replaced, and it hurt a lot to see a new cat (who looks somewhat similar to Whiskers) running around the house so soon after he died. I tried to avoid the kitten, but my stepmom kept trying to get me to interact with Muffin, saying things like, ""Muffin will help you feel better"" and ""Isn't she adorable?""

I know she meant well, but it just made me more upset. My dad tried to mediate and explained that my stepmom hates being in a house without a pet, and getting Muffin was her way of coping with the loss. He also pointed out that Muffin wouldn't replace Whiskers but rather be a new member of the family. I understand where they're coming from, but I still can't help feeling angry and hurt. It feels too soon for me, and seeing Muffin just reminds me of how much I miss Whiskers.

My friends have mixed opinions on this. Some think I'm being unreasonable and that the new kitten could actually help me heal, while others think it's incredibly insensitive to bring in a new pet so quickly. As of now, things are pretty tense at home. My stepmom seems to feel bad for upsetting me, but she also defends her decision, expressing how lonely and sad she felt without a pet around.

Am I the asshole for being disgusted by my stepmom's new kitten just five days after our cat passed away?"
30,30,AITA for getting myself water from behind the bar?,"I was at a pub for an evening with friends. It's a two level establishment, with a quiet section upstairs that we're at.

So if I want to have a friend stay with me for a few days, my roommate has to agree and vice versa. We both have had friends over before and it's always gone over peacefully. We both also have had more than one friend over with no issues because we respected eachother's space and belongings.

I love hanging out with this group because we all share a similar vibe, and the energy is always fun. We were having a great time, eating good food, and catching up after a long week.

So, after our meal, I felt really thirsty. I asked our server if they could bring me a glass of water. They told me that the bar had a strict policy about serving water and that I would need to order a drink first. At first, I thought they were joking, but the server was serious. I wasn’t about to pay for a soda or beer just to quench my thirst, especially since I’m trying to be more health-conscious and avoid sugary drinks. 

After a few minutes of waiting and feeling increasingly parched, I decided to take matters into my own hands. The pub had a self-serve area with water jugs as well as cups, so I quietly walked over to fill a glass for myself. I figured since the water was out in the open, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But as I was filling my glass, the same server spotted me and came over, looking furious. They told me I wasn't allowed to do that and that I needed to sit down and wait for my drink. 

I told them I was just trying to get some water because I was thirsty. The server escalated it by saying I was being disrespectful and could be kicked out for ignoring their rules. I felt humiliated and just returned to my table, but I couldn't shake the frustration I felt about the whole situation. I ended up sharing what happened with my friends, and some thought I was justified in getting my own water, while others believed I should have just ordered something instead.

As the night went on, I could tell the vibe had shifted. Some people were whispering about the incident, and I felt like I was the topic of conversation. I can see now that maybe I could have handled it differently, but I was just so frustrated by the whole server's attitude. My friends mostly backed me up, but a couple of them pointed out that I probably escalated it by pushing back on the server instead of just accepting their policy.

In hindsight, I understand the server was just doing their job, but it felt like such a ridiculous situation to me. There's a part of me that thinks I might have overreacted, but I don’t think I was wrong to want some water. So, AITA for filling my own glass at the pub when they wouldn’t serve me water?","Last weekend, I went out with some friends to a local pub. We were having a great time, enjoying food and drinks, when I realized I was getting pretty thirsty and wanted some water. I went up to the bar to ask for a glass of water, but the bartender told me they were too busy and I'd have to wait. I waited for about fifteen minutes, and when I tried again, I got the same response.

Frustrated, I saw a self-service water station on the other side of the bar, but it was roped off and looked like it was for employees only. Desperate, I decided to quickly go over and fill my glass there. I thought it'd be a simple and harmless act, but as soon as I started pouring, one of the bartenders saw me and came over, looking furious. They told me I wasn't allowed back there and that I needed to wait my turn like everyone else. In my annoyance, I snapped back that I had already waited and they weren't doing their job by not serving me water. 

This obviously didn't go over well. The manager got involved, and I was told to leave if I couldn't respect their rules. My friends got upset too, saying that I overreacted and should've just waited a bit longer. They were annoyed that my actions caused a scene and potentially embarrassed them. We ended up leaving the pub shortly after this incident.

On one hand, I felt justified in my actions because denying someone water seemed unreasonable, especially when they weren't even busy in the moment I filled my glass. On the other hand, I can see how my actions could be seen as disrespectful and could understand the staff's frustration.

So here I am, wondering if I was the asshole for filling my own glass instead of waiting for the pub staff to serve me. Am I?"

He’s been struggling to find a job in his field and decided to move back home with our parents while he figures it out. I totally understand that times are tough, and many of us have been there, but we had a family chat over dinner last week that got me thinking.

During the dinner, my parents made a point of saying how happy they were to have him back and how they would support him for as long as he needed. However, I noticed my brother seemed very unmotivated. He spends most of his time playing video games and watching TV rather than actively looking for jobs. When I brought this up, my parents brushed it off and said he needed time to relax after the stress of college.

Seeing him in that situation and how comfortable he was just lounging at home made me concerned. I believe it's important for him to experience a bit of independence and responsibility, especially now that he’s an adult. I gently suggested that instead of moving back home, maybe he should consider renting a small place for himself. I thought it might motivate him to find work, meet new people, and learn to manage his own life.

My brother did not take this suggestion well at all. He felt hurt and accused me of not being supportive, saying that it wasn’t helpful to pressure him right now. My parents backed him up, explaining that the job market is rough, and he needs their support, not demands.

I still feel that it would be beneficial for him to have that independence, but on the other hand, I understand that he’s going through a tough time. I don’t want to make family tensions worse, but I also want what’s best for my brother. 

So, am I the asshole for telling my brother to rent a place instead of moving back home?","My younger brother, Jake, 28M, recently broke up with his long-term girlfriend and has been struggling to find a new place to stay. He reached out to me, 32F, and our parents, and suggested moving back home temporarily until he can find a new apartment. Our parents were open to the idea, but I voiced my concerns and suggested he rent a place instead.

For context, Jake and I both moved out of our parents' house years ago. They downsized to a smaller home once we were gone, so space is pretty tight now. Jake's relationship had been a bit tumultuous, and every time he faced issues, he would lean heavily on our parents for support. While I understand that he needs a support system right now, I'm worried about the impact this will have on our parents, who are both retired and looking forward to some peace and quiet.

When I suggested that Jake consider renting a place temporarily, maybe even with some financial help from me and our parents if needed, he seemed hurt by my suggestion. He felt that I was trying to push him away during a difficult time. My perspective, however, is that moving back home could potentially disrupt our parents' routine and put a strain on them, especially if this temporary situation drags on longer than anticipated.

I spoke with our parents about my concerns, and while they appreciate my considerations, they believe they can handle it and want to be there for Jake. Meanwhile, some of my friends think I'm being practical and looking out for everyone's best interests, while others feel I might be lacking empathy for Jake's situation.

Now, Jake has started looking into rental options, but there's noticeable tension between us. I feel bad for suggesting it, yet I still believe it was the right thing to do for our parents' sake. Our relationship is strained, and I keep wondering if I should have just stayed silent and let things play out.

So, am I the asshole for telling my brother to rent a place instead of moving back home?"
32,32,AITA for not responding after being treated badly this weekend?,I(21F) have small friend group. One of the girls in the group is under 21 so it hard for us to go to bars/clubs without making her feel left out. On the 29th one of my favorite bars was doing a Halloween event that seemed like fun. So I suggested that on Friday we would go to house parties so everyone could go together then on Saturday we would go to the bars It seemed like a win win.   leading up to Halloweekend I noticed that a party flyer was going around. It was a party hosted by the girl who is under 21. I only found out about the party because I seen the flyer posted on someone instagram story. Nobody told me about it.

But a few weeks ago, I noticed a bunch of messages in our group chat about a party they were planning. I was excited at first, but then it hit me: I had never been consulted about it. They had decided on the date, location, and even the guest list without even asking for my input.

I felt hurt and honestly a bit betrayed. I mean, we’ve always talked things through in the past. It wasn't just that I wasn't invited; it felt like I wasn’t even part of the conversation anymore. When I brought it up to a couple of friends, they brushed it off like it was no big deal, saying it was just a small get-together. One friend even said that it was probably just an oversight since they were planning it last minute.

I tried to brush off my feelings and not take it personally, but the party day came and my friends were posting pictures and videos in our group chat, and I felt isolated. I snapped a bit and expressed how I felt left out which, to be honest, they didn't take too well. They said I was being dramatic and that I needed to lighten up. I felt like I had every right to feel upset, but then I also felt guilty for snapping at them.

Now I'm at a crossroads. Part of me is considering cutting ties with these friends because I don't want to feel like I’m holding on to relationships that don’t value my presence. But another part of me wonders if I'm overreacting and if I should just let things go. A couple of mutual friends think I should give it some time and not make any rash decisions, while others have said that if they really cared, they would have made sure I was included.

I know I might be overthinking it, but it just feels like this is a pattern of being sidelined in our friendships. I don't want to be the one to just walk away, but I also don’t want to keep setting myself up to feel hurt. Am I the asshole for considering cutting off friends who planned a party without me?","I’ve been part of this friend group for over a decade. We’ve shared countless memories, birthdays, holidays, and spontaneous get-togethers. We’re that close-knit bunch you’d expect to see in sitcoms, always hanging out and supporting each other. Or so I thought.

A few weeks ago, I found out through social media that my friends had thrown a massive surprise birthday party for one of the members in the group. Here’s the kicker—they didn’t invite me. I saw the photos, the videos, the stories, and felt a wave of hurt and betrayal wash over me. It wasn’t just any party; it was elaborate, with decorations, a giant cake, and everyone seemed to be having a blast.

Confused and hurt, I reached out to my best friend in the group, Sarah, to ask why I was left out. Her response was that it wasn’t intentional, and that they must have just forgotten to include me in the plans. She apologized, but it felt hollow considering the tight bond I thought we all had.

Not knowing how to handle my emotions, I decided to confront the group during our next meetup. I told them how I felt, that it seemed an intentional slight rather than an innocent forgetfulness. Some of them looked genuinely taken aback and apologized, while a couple of others seemed dismissive, saying I was overreacting and that these things happen.

This incident has been gnawing at me, and I’ve been pondering cutting ties with them. It feels like a betrayal from people I considered family. However, I’m well aware that suddenly ghosting them or making a big scene could be seen as an overreaction and might indeed paint me as the asshole in this scenario.

When I shared what happened with a few other friends and family members, opinions were split. Some understand why I feel hurt and think it’s justified to feel betrayed. Others believe it was an honest mistake and cutting them off would be too extreme.

Fast forward to now, and things are awkward. Our interactions feel forced and stilted, and there’s this invisible wall between us. I miss the easy camaraderie we used to share, but I can’t shake off the hurt. The incident has made me second-guess our entire friendship. Am I the asshole for considering cutting off friends who planned a party without me?"

AITA for not bringing my husbands biological daughter into our lives?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: NAH, Title: 'AITA for Listening to My Parents and Ditching My Dream Job on a Horse Farm?'""}]","I’ve always had a passion for horses. Growing up, I spent every free moment at the local stables, volunteering, and learning everything I could about horse care and training. For years, I dreamed of working on a horse farm, and when I finally graduated high school, I got the opportunity of a lifetime: a job offer at a renowned horse farm in a nearby state. It felt like my dream was finally coming true.

When I first told my parents, they were supportive but a bit concerned. They knew how competitive and challenging the horse industry can be, and they worried about my long-term future. They encouraged me to consider pursuing a more stable career, something that I could rely on financially, like going to college and studying something more practical. I brushed it off at first, thinking they just didn’t understand my passion.

However, once I started working at the farm, I quickly realized just how intense and demanding the job was. The hours were long, the pay was low, and there was a significant lack of job security. I often came home exhausted, both physically and emotionally. After a few months, I began to feel the weight of all my parents’ concerns, and I started questioning whether this was the right path for me.

After much deliberation, I decided to listen to my parents and took a step back to pursue my education instead. I enrolled in a community college and started taking business classes, thinking that maybe I could manage a stable one day or work in the horse industry from a different angle. It was a tough decision, and I felt really guilty about leaving the farm and my dream behind.

When I shared my decision with friends from the farm, some were understanding while others were disappointed and thought I was giving up. A few of my coworkers felt betrayed because they knew how passionate I was about working with horses. However, my family was proud and relieved, thinking this was a smart move for my future.

Now, I still love horses, and I’m considering ways to get back into that world, possibly through internships or part-time work while I finish school. But I can’t help but feel like I let myself down by not chasing my dream.

So, AITA for listening to my parents and ditching my dream job on a horse farm?","Ever since I was a little kid, I've loved horses. My dream has always been to work on a horse farm. When I was 18, I got the opportunity to work at a horse farm in another state. It was everything I wanted: surrounded by nature, taking care of horses, and learning the ins and outs of farm life.

But my parents were absolutely against it. They wanted me to go to college, get a degree in something ""practical,"" and have a stable career. They were worried the horse farm job wouldn't provide me with financial security or career growth. They even pointed out that the job didn't offer any benefits and the pay was barely above minimum wage. We had countless arguments about it, and they always ended with my parents saying they just wanted what was best for me.

Feeling torn, I consulted some close friends and extended family members. Most of them sided with my parents, highlighting the importance of a stable job and the long-term benefits of a college degree. Some even suggested that I could always pursue my passion for horses as a hobby rather than a career. 

In the end, I decided to follow my parents' advice. I enrolled in college and chose a major in business administration. It's been three years now, and while I'm doing well academically and have secured several internships, I can't shake off the feeling that I've abandoned my true passion. Whenever I see pictures or videos of horses, or hear about someone working on a farm, I feel a pang of regret.

My parents are thrilled with my progress and often tell me how proud they are. I understand they only wanted the best for me, and I can't blame them for that. But there's a part of me that wonders what life would have been like if I had taken that job on the horse farm. Would I have been happier?

Recently, I brought up the topic again with my parents, mentioning my lingering regrets. They were understanding and said they never meant to stifle my dreams, but just wanted to make sure I had a secure future. They even suggested that, after I graduate, I could find a way to incorporate my love for horses into my life, perhaps by volunteering at a local stable or even considering a career shift later on.

So, am I the asshole for listening to my parents and ditching my dream job on a horse farm? Looking back, I realize there were valid concerns on both sides, and I'm still trying to figure out the best path for me."

I (38M) have been married to my wife (36F) for ten years, and we have two kids together, a son (10M) and a daughter (8F). My wife has been planning a dream vacation to Hawaii for over a year, and this trip was supposed to be her chance to unwind and finally escape the stress of work and family responsibilities.

Last weekend, while my wife was out shopping, my son and his friends were playing in the backyard. Things got a bit rowdy, and my son ended up falling off the swing set and breaking his arm. He immediately started crying, and I could see the panic in his eyes, but I tried to keep calm. I quickly took him to the hospital, where they confirmed he had a fracture and put a cast on his arm.

Now, here's where it gets complicated. My wife’s trip was just days away, and I knew from past experience that she'd tend to worry excessively about any problems leading up to big events. I also knew that if I told her about our son's injury right before the vacation, it would ruin her excitement and cause her a lot of stress. I decided to keep it a secret until after the trip. My son and I agreed that we'd just tell her he fell but was fine, and I promised to keep an eye on him while she was away.

The vacation turned out to be incredible. My wife was so happy, and the kids had a blast. I kept up with our son’s care and made sure he was comfortable and entertained. When we returned, my wife noticed the cast and immediately freaked out. She was upset that I didn’t tell her, and although I explained my reasoning, she felt hurt that I would keep something so significant from her.

I don’t want to hide things from her, but I thought I was acting in her best interest. My wife says I should have trusted her to handle it, no matter how stressful it might have been for her. Family and friends have mixed opinions; some say I did the right thing to protect her joy, while others think I should have been upfront about our son’s injury.

So, am I the asshole for keeping my son's broken arm a secret from my wife to save her stress on her dream vacation?","My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been planning her dream vacation for years. She's always wanted to go to Italy and finally, everything lined up perfectly. We saved enough money, had the time off work, and our kids are old enough to stay with my parents for a week. My wife works extremely hard and deals with a lot of stress, so this trip was incredibly important to her.

On the second day she was gone, I was watching our son (8M) and daughter (5F) when my son fell off his bike and broke his arm. It was a clean break and the doctors said it would heal perfectly with a cast. He was incredibly brave about the whole thing and once he had his arm sorted, he didn't seem to be in much pain. My parents and I managed everything without any significant issues.

Here's where it gets tricky. I didn't tell my wife. She was having such an amazing time, sending me pictures of her with various landmarks, tasting different wines, and just genuinely enjoying herself. I couldn't bear to ruin her trip with news that would make her worry, knowing she'd want to rush home and miss out on something she’s always dreamed about. Our son was in good hands with me and my parents, and he was handling it fine.

I planned to tell her once she got back, but she ended up finding out accidentally. One of my neighbors mentioned something about the cast when she called home to check in. My wife was understandably upset and felt betrayed that I kept such an important thing from her. She came home, a bit earlier than planned, worried and upset.

My parents thought I did the right thing by not telling her to avoid unnecessary worry and stress on her vacation. My wife thinks I should have told her right away, no matter what. She feels like I took away her right to know what was happening with our child and feels guilty for not being there.

Now, I’m torn. I genuinely thought I was protecting her joy and peace, but I see her point too. Our son is healing well and everything is back to normal, but there’s this lingering tension between us.

I (26F) recently moved into a three-bedroom apartment with two roommates (let’s call them Sarah and Megan). From the start, I wanted to establish some rules to create a comfortable living environment, especially since I’m a bit of a neat freak and also value personal space. I suggested a cleaning schedule and a few house rules regarding noise and visitors, which I thought were pretty reasonable.

Well, things quickly escalated. Sarah and Megan weren't on board with my ideas. They felt that I was being too controlling and insisted on their right to live freely in their own home. For example, I mentioned that I’d appreciate it if they could limit guests to a couple of times a week to keep things quiet during the workweek. They shot back that they should be able to have friends over whenever they want, and I understood their point but thought it was fair to impose some limits for everyone’s benefit.

Then came the cleaning schedule. I created a detailed chart where everyone had specific duties each week. Sarah has a busy work schedule, and Megan is going through a rough breakup, and suddenly they felt overwhelmed by the structure I was imposing. They argued that living together should be more about flexibility, and the vibe of the apartment felt strained when I didn’t feel the chores were being done properly.

I’ve tried to compromise by suggesting that we could rotate some responsibilities and that I wouldn’t mind picking up more if they needed me to, but they still think I'm being too rigid. They’ve started to get distant, and it feels like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around them, which I really don’t like.

Now I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for being too controlling with them and refusing to compromise on how I believe our shared space should be managed. I genuinely thought I was just trying to create a harmonious living environment, but maybe I overstepped. AITA for holding my ground on boundaries and cleanliness?","Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and need some outside perspective. I live in a shared apartment with two roommates, Sarah and Jake. We've been living together for about eight months now. Everything was fine in the beginning, but recently, I've been feeling like I'm the only one who cares about keeping the place in order. 

I'm pretty particular about cleanliness and organization. I have a cleaning schedule that I expect everyone to adhere to, and I have rules about keeping common areas clutter-free. I try to keep the kitchen spotless, and I get really irritated if dishes are left in the sink for more than a couple of hours. I've also implemented a rule that we can only have guests over on weekends and that they have to leave by midnight. 

Sarah and Jake have been pushing back. They think I'm too controlling and that my rules are excessive. Sarah says she's exhausted from work and doesn't have the energy to clean every day. Jake feels like my guest policy is unreasonable, especially since his girlfriend can only visit during the week due to her work schedule. 

Things came to a head when I decided to label all of our food items in the fridge and created a chart to monitor who is eating what. I noticed some of my almond milk was disappearing, and I wanted to make sure it wasn't happening again. Both Sarah and Jake were furious, saying it was invasive and that I was treating them like children.

My friends are divided. Some think I'm right to want a clean and orderly home, while others feel I'm taking it too far. My parents even told me I should try to compromise more and relax a bit, but I don't see why I should sacrifice my comfort and standards.

The current outcome is that Sarah and Jake are pretty cold towards me, and tension is high in the apartment. We've had a few heated arguments, and they even suggested we get a mediator or have a house meeting to discuss the rules. 

So, AITA for being too controlling and refusing to compromise with my roommates?"

To give you some background, my girlfriend, Sarah, and I have been together for about a year. She has a teenage son, Jake, from a previous relationship. To be honest, our relationship has always been a bit complicated because Jake has had some serious behavioral issues. He was always getting into trouble, and his relationship with his mother was strained. 

A few weeks ago, Jake tragically passed away. I didn’t know him well personally since he often clashed with Sarah, and I was very much an outsider in their family dynamic. Sarah is understandably devastated, and she has been leaning heavily on me for support. However, I wasn’t particularly close to Jake, and quite frankly, his behavior towards me made it difficult for me to feel a connection. 

When the funeral was announced, I told Sarah I wouldn’t be attending. I explained that I felt it wasn’t appropriate for me to be there since I didn’t have a personal relationship with Jake and I doubted he would have wanted me there. Sarah was furious. In her grief, she accused me of being heartless and outright told me that it felt like I didn’t care. I tried to further explain my perspective, saying that for me, it wasn’t a loss in the traditional sense because we didn’t have a bond, but that didn’t make her pain any less valid. 

After our conversation, some of my friends were split on the matter. Some said I was justified because I had to honor my own feelings and boundaries. Others felt that I should've put my feelings aside to support Sarah during this awful time, even if it meant being uncomfortable.

Now, Sarah and I are at a serious crossroads. She thinks I should have been there for her, and I believe it’s okay to recognize that I wasn’t affected by Jake’s passing the same way she was. I genuinely feel for her loss, but I wonder if I should’ve handled this differently. 

So, AITA for not attending my girlfriend's son's funeral and telling her it wasn't a loss for me?","I know this title sounds harsh, but please hear me out. I (32M) have been dating my girlfriend, Lisa (30F), for about a year. Lisa has a 10-year-old son, Tim, from a previous relationship. I never got super close to Tim, mainly because Lisa and I were still in the early stages of our relationship, and I was taking it slow to give him time to adjust to my presence.

A couple of months ago, Tim tragically passed away in a car accident while he was with his father. Lisa was, understandably, devastated, and I did my best to support her emotionally. The funeral was scheduled for a weekday morning, and I had a crucial presentation at work on the same day that I had been preparing for months.

I spoke to Lisa and told her about the conflict. She was upset but said she understood that work commitments can be hard to rearrange. I promised I would be there for her in every other way possible. I made sure to spend time with her before and after the funeral to provide emotional support, and I even arranged for her close friend to accompany her so she wouldn't be alone.

However, during a particularly emotional moment, I made what I now realize was an insensitive comment. Lisa was crying and said she felt like her whole world had been destroyed. In an attempt to be honest, I told her that while I was incredibly sorry for her loss, it wasn't a personal loss for me because I wasn't that close to Tim. I wanted to convey that I was there for her, but it came out all wrong. 

Lisa was hurt by my comment and said it made her feel like I didn't care about her or Tim. She has since cooled off towards me and doesn't seem as open about her feelings as she used to be. Her family has also been giving me the cold shoulder, and some friends have hinted that I should have skipped the presentation.

My friends are divided. Some say I was just being practical and honest, while others think I should have been more sensitive and attended the funeral regardless. I’m truly torn because I feel that both perspectives have validity.

In retrospect, I see how my words could have been hurtful, and I regret saying them. But at the same time, I had a significant work commitment that I couldn't ignore without serious repercussions. I made an effort to support Lisa in other ways, but maybe it wasn't enough.

Am I the asshole for not attending my girlfriend's son's funeral and telling her it wasn't a loss for me?"

Recently, I made the mistake of experimenting with some minor skips from school—nothing serious, just trying to feel a little more independent and adventurous. It was during those days that I spent time working on my drawing skills and exploring interests I didn’t have time for with a full school schedule.

One day, I confided in my friend Sarah (18F) about some of my escapades, thinking she’d understand where I was coming from. To my shock, she went and told a teacher about it, which led to a meeting with the school counselor. They got concerned about my attendance and started digging into my reasons for skipping. I felt betrayed since I thought friends should keep secrets like that to themselves, especially when it’s about something harmless and personal.

When I found out, I confronted Sarah. I was upset and told her that what she did was incredibly untrustworthy and that she had no right to snitch on me to the school. She tried to defend herself, saying she was worried about me and thought that the school should step in. To me, that felt like a cop-out. I told her that being worried about someone doesn’t justify breaking their trust and that I expected more loyalty from her as a friend. Our argument escalated, and I said a few things in anger that I now regret.

Now, our friend group feels tense, and some of our mutual friends are taking sides. Some believe I should have just let it go and others think Sarah crossed the line. I’ve apologized for my tone but still feel that I had the right to express my frustration. I’m now left feeling like I might have taken things too far and that maybe I should have handled it differently, but I also feel justified in calling her out.

So, AITA for telling off my friend who snitched on me to my school?","I (16M) go to a pretty strict high school where discipline is a big thing. We have a lot of rules, and breaking them can lead to serious consequences. A week ago, I made a stupid decision and skipped a couple of classes to hang out with my friends off-campus. It was the first time I'd done it, and I knew it wasn’t a smart move, but I figured it was harmless.

Well, turns out someone saw us and decided to report us to the school administration. I never thought it would be one of my own friends. My “friend” (16M), let’s call him Jake, ratted us out. The school called me in and gave me detention for a week and a stern warning. My parents were furious, and now I’m grounded for the entire month.

When I found out Jake was the one who snitched, I lost it. I confronted him during lunch in front of a bunch of people and told him off, calling him a “traitor” and a “rat.” He tried to explain that he was just trying to do the right thing and was worried about us getting into more serious trouble, but I was too angry to listen. I told him to mind his own business next time and that he’s no friend of mine.

A lot of our mutual friends are torn. Some think I had every right to be angry, but others believe that Jake did the right thing and that I’m overreacting. My parents said I should have handled it more maturely, but they also believe it’s a lesson learned. Jake hasn’t spoken to me since, and things have been super awkward at school.

I get that skipping classes was wrong and that I deserved some kind of punishment, but getting snitched on by Jake felt like a massive betrayal. Now I'm questioning if I went too far by lashing out at him publicly. So, AITA for telling off my friend who snitched on me to my school?"

During Covid Theo (25ish M) joined our crew. In the 2 years we have known him, he has NEVER mentioned a spouse. He’s talked about friends and family, his favorite things, what he’s cooking for dinner, everything but that and kind of made himself sound single. A couple of coworkers even asked him out but he declined because he doesn’t date coworkers. I can’t deny he’s VERY good looking which attracted a lot of interest from coworkers.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was walking home from grocery shopping near work and my bag split.

We've always had a strong bond and I thought it was unbreakable. Over the past year, Mark started dating Jenna (27F). Initially, I welcomed her into our friend group, and we all hung out together, but things started to change when Jenna began making comments about our friendship.

At first, it was little things, like how we spent too much time together and should include her more, which I brushed off. But then she began to get more direct, expressing that she didn’t like how close Mark and I were. It escalated to her saying that I was a ""bad influence"" on him and suggesting that he should cut back on hanging out with me. Mark seemed to take her side, often canceling our plans to spend time with her instead, which really hurt me.

A few weeks ago, I threw a birthday party for myself and invited Mark, along with a few other friends, of course. I was excited to celebrate together like we always had. Suddenly, the day before the party, Mark told me he wouldn’t be coming because Jenna had planned something for them. I felt pretty crushed, especially after he mentioned he had forgotten about my party in the first place. I sent him a text expressing how disappointed I was that he couldn't make it, and I blurted out that I expected him to prioritize our friendship over his girlfriend’s feelings.

This caused a rift. Mark confronted me about my message, saying I was being unreasonable and selfish. He argued that Jenna was his girlfriend and that he wanted to make her happy. I was taken aback and tried to explain that our friendship was just as important. Our other friends weighed in too, and some sided with me, saying that friendships should stand the test of relationships, while others thought I was being dramatic.

After our argument, things have been tense between us. Mark seems to be distancing himself even more, and it hurts, especially since I feel like I'm losing a lifelong friend over this situation. I know I might have overstepped by expecting him to put our friendship first, but I truly value what we had and miss how things used to be. So, am I the asshole for expecting my friend to prioritize our friendship over his girlfriend's feelings?","My best friend Jake (28M) and I (27M) have been close since high school. We’ve been through a lot together, from college shenanigans to job changes and everything in between. I always thought our bond was unbreakable, and we promised we’d always have each other’s backs.

A year ago, Jake started dating Emily (26F). At first, I was really happy for him. Emily seemed nice, and Jake was genuinely excited about the relationship. However, over time, I started noticing changes. Jake began declining our usual hangouts, saying he had plans with Emily or that she didn’t like the places we used to go. 

The last straw for me was when our favorite band's reunion concert was announced. We had been obsessed with this band as teenagers, and when I got the tickets, I was ecstatic. I called Jake immediately to share the news, expecting him to be just as excited. But instead, he hesitated and said he had promised Emily they’d have a quiet weekend together, as she wasn't big on concerts. I was disappointed and a bit angry. We had been talking about seeing this band if they ever reunited since high school!

I decided to confront Jake about it. I told him our friendship should come first and that Emily should understand that. It wasn’t fair for him to ditch our long-standing plans because of her preferences. Jake looked really taken aback and told me while he values our friendship, Emily is his girlfriend and her feelings are important to him. He said he couldn’t just ignore her wishes and do whatever he wanted all the time and asked me to understand his position. I shot back, saying that real friends don’t ditch each other for someone they’ve known for a fraction of the time.

This led to a big argument, and Jake left looking pretty upset. My other friends have mixed opinions. Some agree with me, saying bros before everything, but others think I'm being unreasonable and that Jake has a right to prioritize his relationship. 

Now, Jake hasn’t been answering my calls or texts, and I heard from a mutual friend that he’s really hurt. Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to put our friendship before his girlfriend's feelings?"

Let me give you the backstory first. I’ve known my friend “Sara” for about five years now. We became close in college, and we really bonded over a lot of things, including our shared struggles with anxiety. Recently, however, Sara has opened up about her mental health more and has mentioned she’s dealing with OCD and Tourette's Syndrome. 

Now, I understand that mental health issues can manifest in different ways, and I truly want to be supportive. However, there have been moments where her actions raised some red flags for me and the other friends in our group. For instance, she frequently has these rituals that she insists are linked to her OCD, and while I get that it’s real for her, there are times when it feels exaggerated. 

Things came to a head during a group outing last week. We were at a restaurant when Sara had a noticeable episode where she was repeating certain phrases loudly and meticulously counting her utensils. While I know this could be part of her condition, it felt really out of place in a social setting, and honestly, I was embarrassed for her. I couldn’t help but express this to our mutual friends, and I ended up jokingly saying that maybe she was just faking it for attention. I thought it would lighten the mood, but it backfired horribly.

My comment led to a huge argument. Sara was visibly upset and told me I was being insensitive and ignorant, and she stormed out. Our friends were divided; some felt I was being a jerk, while others thought I was just being honest. I later tried to apologize, but the damage was already done. Sara won’t return my texts, and it feels like I’ve ruined our friendship.

Now I’m sitting here questioning whether I truly crossed a line or if my concerns were valid. I never meant to undermine her experiences; I just wanted to understand them better. AITA for accusing my friend of faking her OCD and Tourette's?","I (27F) have been friends with “Emily” (27F) since we were in middle school. Recently, Emily was diagnosed with OCD and Tourette's Syndrome. I was shocked because I had never noticed any symptoms during our years of friendship. I'm not a medical expert, but it seemed odd to me that these disorders would emerge so suddenly and dramatically.

About a month ago, Emily started talking a lot more about her conditions, especially on social media. She would post about her struggles and how she's trying to cope. I noticed that whenever we were in public or around new people, her tics and OCD behaviors seemed to be more pronounced. At first, I tried to be supportive, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

During a girls' night out last weekend, Emily had several noticeable tics and repeatedly checked her bag and surroundings, which she said were her OCD behaviors. I lost my patience and, in front of our friends, asked her if she was exaggerating or faking her conditions for attention. I know it was an awful thing to say, but I was frustrated because it felt like she was overshadowing everyone else’s issues with her constant need for attention.

The room went silent, and Emily looked hurt. She left the gathering early, and I immediately felt a pang of guilt. The next day, a few of our friends reached out to me saying that I was out of line and that I should apologize to Emily. One friend, however, agreed with me and said she had also noticed Emily's symptoms seem to appear more when there's an audience.

Emily hasn’t spoken to me since that night, and I heard through a mutual friend that she’s really upset. I’m torn because I don’t want to invalidate her experience if she’s genuinely struggling, but I also don’t want to enable attention-seeking behavior if that’s what’s happening. I haven’t reached out to apologize yet because I’m not sure if I should. 

So, AITA for accusing my friend of faking her OCD and Tourette's?"

My fiancé's sister, ""Lily,"" has always been a bit of a wildcard. She's the life of the party, always making jokes and being the center of attention, but she's also known for being flippant and not taking things seriously when it comes to family events. I’ve always gotten along well with her, even when she has done some pretty off-the-wall things, but this time I was a bit taken aback.

When I was planning my bridal shower, I assumed that, like most family members, Lily would want to contribute to the celebration somehow—especially since she’s been part of the wedding planning discussions. I was very careful to keep the guest list within my fiancé's family limited to just close relatives, and I made it clear that her presence would mean a lot to me. 

On the day of the shower, I was excited but also nervous. The decorations were beautiful, and the food was amazing. When it came time to open gifts, I felt a wave of disappointment when I saw that Lily had not brought anything. Everyone else had given thoughtful gifts, and when it was Lily's turn, she jokingly said she didn’t believe in bridal shower gifts because they were a “money grab.”

After the party, I expressed my feelings to my fiancé and told him I felt hurt. He said he understood but thought I was being too harsh; he knows Lily’s personality and said I should have expected that. I felt like she could have at least given a card or something small, considering how much effort went into planning the day. 

Now, some of my friends think I should just let it go, saying it’s not the end of the world, but I can’t shake the feeling that it was disrespectful, especially since I was so excited to include her in such a special day. I can’t help but feel that if she truly cared, she would have made some effort to acknowledge it.

So, AITA for expecting a gift from my fiancé's sister at my bridal shower?","I'm getting married in a few months and recently had my bridal shower. It was a lovely event organized by my bridesmaids, and it seemed like everyone had a great time. There was a lot of excitement, laughter, and, of course, gift-giving. I received lots of beautiful and thoughtful gifts from my friends, family, and future in-laws—except from my fiancé’s sister, (25F).

To give some context, my fiancé’s sister and I have never really been close, but we've always been cordial. She's kind of reserved and not the most expressive person. While I was opening gifts at the shower, I noticed she didn't hand me a present. I assumed it might have been left somewhere or that she would give it to me later. But as the day went on, no gift from her appeared.

Later that evening, I casually mentioned it to my fiancé. He brushed it off, saying that his sister isn't big on social norms and maybe she just didn't think it was necessary to bring a gift. He said it wasn't a big deal, but I couldn't help but feel hurt. It's my bridal shower, after all! Everyone else brought something, and her not bringing anything felt like she didn't care about celebrating this milestone with me.

I decided to bring it up with her directly. I tried to keep it light and non-confrontational, mentioning how much I appreciated her being there and just wondered if perhaps her gift got misplaced. She looked surprised and awkwardly said she didn’t realize she was expected to bring a gift, but then said she would get me something if it meant that much to me.

I could tell she was uncomfortable, and now my fiancé is upset with me for making her feel bad. He says I made a big deal out of nothing and that it's not fair to expect everyone to follow the same traditions. Some of my friends think I overreacted and that it’s not worth creating tension over a present, but my mom and some of my bridesmaids believe she should have brought a gift and are on my side.

Now, things are a bit tense between us. I didn’t mean to cause any drama; I just felt like she should have made an effort, considering the occasion. Was I out of line for expecting a gift and bringing it up with her? Am I the asshole?"

This year, we decided to go to a beautiful beach resort, and everyone was excited. However, about a month ago, I discovered that my dad was having an affair. I found some texts on his phone while he was in the shower, and I was completely shattered. My parents have been together for over 25 years, and I honestly thought everything was fine.

Once I confronted my dad about it, he tried to deny it at first but then admitted to the affair. I felt a mixture of anger, betrayal, and confusion. I wasn’t sure how my mom would react, but I knew I had to tell her the truth before our trip. I didn’t want her to be blindsided if she noticed something was off or if she found out from someone else.

I sat my parents down a week before the trip and forced my dad to confess to my mom. It was emotionally charged, and my mom was devastated. She had no idea, and I could see her heart break right in front of me. The atmosphere shifted drastically; the excitement of our upcoming trip was replaced with tension and hurt feelings. My dad was furious with me for ruining the trip and for “forcing” him into a confession. He said that I should have kept my mouth shut until after the vacation, suggesting that we could “just enjoy this one last trip as a family” before dealing with the fallout.

My siblings had mixed reactions. Some felt that I did the right thing by being honest, while others thought I should’ve waited. They were worried that all the drama would ruin the trip for everyone. I didn’t want to ruin anyone’s vacation, but I felt it was crucial for my mom to know the truth, especially if my dad had plans to continue seeing the other woman. 

Now, the trip is approaching, and things are still tense. My mom is still processing everything, and my dad is barely talking to me. I feel guilty about the emotional fallout but also believe that it was necessary to expose the truth.

I stumbled upon some explicit messages on his phone while helping him with a tech issue. It completely shattered my perception of him. My parents have been married for over 25 years, and I always thought they had a solid relationship.

We're all supposed to go on a big family trip together in a couple of weeks, something we've been planning and looking forward to for almost a year. It’s a rare occasion when all of us—me, my younger brother (22M), my mom, and dad—can get together because we all live in different states now.

I couldn’t keep this information to myself, so I confronted my dad privately and asked him to come clean to my mom before the trip. I told him it was unfair to drag us all on a vacation under false pretenses. He begged me not to say anything, claiming it was a mistake and he had already ended the affair. He said he needed time to fix things on his own terms and that this trip would be a chance for him to start making amends.

I was caught between a rock and a hard place, but I stood my ground and insisted he tell my mom before we left. I couldn’t stand the idea of pretending everything was perfect while knowing the truth. I even gave him a deadline to confess, or else I would tell her myself.

Reluctantly, he confessed to my mom a few days ago. As expected, she was devastated. The atmosphere at home has been tense and uncomfortable since then. Now, there’s talk of canceling the trip altogether because my mom feels too emotionally drained to go. My brother, who had no idea about any of this, is mad at me for instigating the confession before the trip, saying I ruined the only chance we had for a family vacation and that I should have waited until after.

I feel terrible, but I also believe it was the right thing to do. My dad's affair was a ticking time bomb, and I thought it was better to deal with it sooner rather than later. However, seeing how upset everyone is, I’m starting to question my actions.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for forcing my dad to confess his infidelity before our family trip and potentially ruining it for everyone?"

A few weeks back, he got robbed while walking home late at night. At least, that’s what he told us. He said that two guys jumped him, grabbed his phone and wallet, and left him shaken up. He was visibly upset the next day when he showed up to our friend group hangout, and everyone was initially sympathetic.

However, as the days went by, inconsistencies in his story started to pop up. First, he claimed that the incident happened right near our favorite pizza place, but then he said it was near a grocery store that’s several blocks away. Some friends started whispering behind his back, suggesting that maybe he was making it up for attention or to explain why he was broke and couldn’t pay for anything lately.

I genuinely believed Mark. I know how anxiety-inducing being in such a situation can be, especially living in a city where crime rates are high. I didn't want to jump on the bandwagon of doubt because it felt wrong to me. So, I defended him when others were saying he was lying, insisting that he was going through something traumatic and it was important to support him rather than accuse him of being dishonest.

Things got heated when one of our friends, Lisa (21F), confronted me about it, saying it was absurd for me to believe someone who might just be playing the victim. I snapped and said that whether he was lying or not, he needed friends who believed in him during a tough time, not friends who doubted him. I think I might have come off as overly defensive, and a couple of others started to agree with Lisa.

Eventually, Mark confessed to another friend that he exaggerated the story—he had been in a minor altercation but nothing as serious as he claimed. I felt blindsided, and while I was glad I believed him when others didn't, I also felt betrayed knowing that I defended someone who was essentially lying. 

Now, this has created a rift in our friend group. Some people think I should have seen through his lies and held him accountable, while others appreciate that I stood by him. I’m torn between feeling justified in my support and knowing I might have made everyone else doubt my judgment.

So, AITA for believing Mark’s robbery story when everyone else thought he was lying?","So, here’s the situation. I have this friend, Jake (28M), who I've known since high school. We’ve always been tight, and I've always seen him as an honest, stand-up guy. Recently, Jake called me in the middle of the night, panicked and shaken, saying he had been robbed while walking home from a late shift at work. He described how two guys jumped him, took his wallet, watch, and phone, and ran off. Naturally, I believed him and offered to help however I could.

The next day, I told our mutual friends about what happened, thinking they’d want to support Jake too. To my surprise, they were all skeptical. They started pointing out how Jake has a bit of a history of embellishing stories to get attention. They also mentioned some unusual circumstances about the robbery, like why Jake was walking in a sketchy neighborhood when he could have taken a safer route.

Our friend group started debating whether Jake was telling the truth or making it up for sympathy or money. Jake had asked me to lend him some cash until he could get his cards replaced. I didn’t think twice about it and handed him $200. But when the others found out, they accused Jake of lying and me of being gullible. They brought up that Jake has owed money to different people in our group for a while and said this whole robbery could just be a ploy to get out of his debts.

Jake found out what our friends were saying and got really pissed. He felt betrayed and hurt that so many people doubted him in his time of need. He asked me to cut ties with the ones who didn’t believe his story, saying he didn’t need that kind of negativity.

Things got more complicated when one of our friends, Lisa, who’s a bit of a detective, did some digging and claimed she found inconsistencies in Jake’s story. She said the police had no record of a robbery report matching Jake’s description and that the CCTV footage from the area didn’t show anything unusual that night. At this point, I was feeling torn. I wanted to believe Jake, but Lisa’s findings made me question everything.

Eventually, Jake admitted he might have exaggerated some details but insisted he was genuinely mugged. I felt like an idiot for being pulled into this mess, and our friends are now divided. Some think Jake’s mostly innocent but a bit of a drama queen, while others believe he’s a compulsive liar.

In the end, our group is fractured, Jake’s not speaking to most of us, and I’m stuck in the middle, feeling like I made everything worse by taking sides too quickly. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for believing my friend's robbery story when everyone else thought he was lying?"

My girlfriend, Mia (23F), and I made plans to throw a big costume party at my place with some close friends. We had picked out our costumes together, and I even spent a good chunk of my savings on decorations and snacks to make it special. It was supposed to be a fun night filled with laughter, music, and all the Halloween vibes!

Fast forward to the day before the party, and Mia calls me while I’m setting up the house. She sounds a bit flustered and tells me she thinks we should go to a different Halloween party instead, hosted by some friends of hers. Apparently, they had a more 'fun' lineup of activities planned, including a spooky movie marathon and a Halloween-themed escape room. I was taken aback because we had put so much thought and effort into our plans, and I thought that meant something to her too.

When I expressed my disappointment, she started getting defensive, saying I was being too rigid and not open to trying new things. I told her it wasn’t just about the activities; it felt like she was undermining what we had planned together. We ended up having a pretty heated argument, with her accusing me of being controlling and me feeling unappreciated for all the work I had put in.

In the end, she decided to go to her friends’ party, and I stayed home alone, feeling really upset. I told some of my friends about the situation, and while they empathized, a lot of them pointed out that I probably overreacted. I’ve been thinking about the whole thing since then, and I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I was too harsh on her for wanting to change plans. 

So, AITA for being angry that my girlfriend changed our Halloween plans at the last minute?","My girlfriend Emily and I have been planning our Halloween celebration for over a month. We were supposed to attend a big costume party with some of our friends. We even coordinated our costumes – I was going to be a pirate and she was going to be a mermaid. I was really looking forward to it because it’s been a while since we both got to let loose and have fun together.

On the day of the party, however, Emily called me while I was at work and said her best friend, Sarah, just went through a bad breakup and is feeling incredibly down. Emily proposed that instead of going to the party, we should stay in and keep Sarah company. She said Sarah could really use some friends around her to cheer her up.

I was pretty annoyed and told Emily that we’ve had these plans for weeks, and it wasn't fair to change them at the last minute. I understand that Sarah is important to her, but I felt like our plans were being completely disregarded. I asked why Sarah couldn’t join us at the party – she could dress up and maybe it would make her feel better. Emily insisted that Sarah wasn’t in the mood for a party and just needed a quiet night in.

This led to an argument where Emily accused me of being insensitive and not caring about her friends. I told her that it’s not about Sarah, but about us always changing our plans for everyone else. In the end, Emily stayed with Sarah and I went to the party by myself. I didn't have nearly as much fun as I expected because I was still frustrated about the whole situation.

When I told some of my friends what happened, they had mixed reactions. Some of them thought my frustration was understandable, but others said I was being selfish and that Emily did the right thing by helping her friend. My mom even chimed in, saying that I should be more supportive of Emily’s decisions, especially when it comes to people she cares about.

Now, Emily and I have been a bit distant, and I can't shake off the feeling that maybe I overreacted. But I also feel like my feelings were valid. Am I the asshole for being angry that my girlfriend changed our Halloween plans at the last minute?"

I’m 17, and for the past few years, I’ve had a close friendship with a girl named Sarah. We clicked immediately, and I consider her one of my best friends. However, my parents have a pretty strict rule about her because of some past issues with her family that they believe could be a negative influence on me. 

Recently, Sarah reached out to me again after a long while. She’s been going through a rough time, and I really want to be there for her like I used to, but my parents constantly remind me that I'm not allowed to talk to her, insisting it’s for my own good. They genuinely think they’re protecting me, but it just feels so unfair to me. 

So here’s where I may have crossed a line. I’ve been seriously considering lying to my parents about my plans. I want to tell them I’m going out with a different friend when I really plan to meet up with Sarah. I know this sounds terrible, and part of me feels really guilty about it, but I can’t shake the feeling that my friendship with Sarah is worth it. I feel so torn between my loyalty to a friend who needs support and my parents’ rules.

When I tried to talk to my parents about it, they were adamant that I shouldn’t be in contact with her at all, and it became a huge argument. They believe they know what's best for me, but I feel like they’re not even trying to understand my side of things. My siblings think I should just respect my parents' wishes, point blank, even if it's hard for me. 

As I’ve been weighing my options, I can’t help but feel that maybe I’m being selfish for wanting to reignite my friendship with Sarah at the cost of honesty with my parents. But at the same time, I miss her so much and want to help her through her struggles. 

Now I’m left wondering if I’m the horrible person here for considering lying just to contact her. So, AITA for even thinking about this?","I'm a 17-year-old girl, and my parents are pretty strict about who I hang out with and talk to. They believe they have my best interests at heart, but sometimes it feels like they go too far. This is especially true when it comes to my friend, Emma.

Emma and I have been friends since middle school, but she has had her struggles. She got into some trouble last year—she was caught shoplifting with some other kids and got suspended from school for a week. My parents freaked out and forbid me from talking to her. They think she's a bad influence, but I know that Emma is trying hard to turn her life around.

Over the past few months, Emma has been really focused on improving herself. She's been doing well in school, joined a volunteer group, and even got a part-time job. I miss our friendship a lot and want to be there to support her. We've been secretly texting, but it's not the same as spending time together.

Here's where the problem comes in. Emma invited me to her birthday party next weekend. I know if I ask my parents for permission, they'll say no without even considering how much she's changed. So, I've been thinking about telling my parents that I'm going to a different friend's house, just so I can go to Emma's party.

My best friend, Sarah, thinks it's a terrible idea. She says lying to my parents will just make things worse if they find out. She thinks I should try talking to them again, explaining how much Emma has changed and how important our friendship is to me. But honestly, I've tried that before, and they just shut me down.

My cousin, who is a bit older and has had her fair share of clashes with our strict family, says I should go for it. She thinks it's important to maintain my friendships and that sometimes you have to bend the rules a bit when your parents are being unreasonable.

So I did it. I lied to my parents and said I was going to Sarah's house to study. I went to Emma's party, and it was amazing to see her so happy and full of life. Coming back home, I felt a mix of guilt and relief. My parents didn't suspect a thing.

But now, I'm feeling conflicted. On one hand, I got to see my friend and support her, which I believe is important. On the other, I went behind my parents' backs and lied to them, which doesn't sit well with me.

Am I the asshole for lying to my parents to maintain a friendship that I believe is positive and supportive?"

We have a really good dynamic, and we generally communicate well. We're both in our early 30s, and while we don't live together, we spend a lot of time at each other's places, and things have been feeling pretty serious.

Recently, we were having a cozy night in, just watching a movie and sharing snacks. Everything was perfect; the ambiance was nice, and we were both relaxed. In the middle of one of those quiet moments, my partner turned to me, looked me in the eye, and said, “You’re just perfect.” I froze. I can't explain why, but I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me. I started to panic and blurted out, “No one is perfect! It’s not real!” I basically freaked out, and I could see my partner’s expression change from warm affection to confusion.

After my outburst, I went on to explain that I have a hard time accepting compliments and that I feel this pressure whenever someone praises me like that. I’ve struggled with feelings of inadequacy for most of my life, and hearing something so seemingly ideal made me feel like I was bound to disappoint. 

My partner tried to reassure me, saying that they were just expressing how much they appreciate me, and that nobody is expecting perfection from me or anyone else. But I just kept spiraling, worrying about how I might not live up to that standard. After a while, the mood shifted from cozy to awkward, and the evening ended in an uncomfortable silence.

In the days following, I kept thinking about what happened, and I felt like I had ruined a perfectly nice moment. I couldn't help but wonder if I overreacted. A few friends have said I was too harsh and that I need to work on accepting compliments, while others have said it’s understandable to feel that way given my history. 

Now, looking back, I'm starting to feel guilty for reacting the way I did. My partner was being sweet and genuine, and I just freaked out. So, am I the asshole for overreacting when my partner said I was ""perfect""?","My partner and I have been together for about a year now, and things have been going really well. We’ve had our ups and downs, like any couple, but I genuinely love him and think he’s wonderful. However, there’s one thing that’s been bothering me, and it came to a head last night.

We were having a cozy night in, just watching movies and enjoying each other’s company. Out of nowhere, he turned to me, looked into my eyes, and said, ""You’re perfect."" Instead of feeling flattered or happy, I completely freaked out. I told him that I’m not perfect and that he shouldn’t put me on a pedestal. I have flaws, just like everyone else, and it felt like he was idealizing me in a way that made me uncomfortable.

He looked taken aback and hurt, and I could see the confusion in his eyes. He tried to explain that he didn’t mean it literally, but rather that he loves me just the way I am. But by then, I was already in full freak-out mode. I accused him of not seeing the real me and told him that his expectations were unrealistic. He was silent for a moment before quietly saying, ""I didn’t know it would upset you. I just wanted to let you know how much I care about you.""

This morning, our mutual friends heard about the incident (since we share a friend group and word travels fast). Most of them think I overreacted. They said it sounded like a sweet, genuine compliment, and I should have taken it as such. One friend even pointed out that we all say things like ""You’re perfect"" to our loved ones, not because we believe they’re without flaws, but because we love them despite those flaws.

I feel awful now, especially seeing how my partner has been quieter than usual, clearly affected by how I reacted. I’m starting to wonder if I really did overreact and if I should have just appreciated the sentiment behind his words instead of nitpicking. I was so caught up in my own insecurities and fear of being idealized that I didn’t consider how my reaction would hurt him.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for freaking out when my partner said I was ""perfect""?"
46,46,WIBTA if I (25m) told my long time friend (26f) I stumbled on her nudes online,"Hi Reddit, bit of a weird one. I'm on my partner's throwaway account   I was scrolling through xx subredits and I happened to see a picture of my long time friend. Her face was in it and I could tell it was her by her tattoo. I went on the profile to confirm it was her and there was one of her Instagram and Facebook pictures there. I decided to tell my partner and we both thought it may be good to let her know  So Reddit would I be the asshole if I let my friend know I saw her account, heres why I want to tell her.  1. The Facebook and Instagram images can be reserve searched so she should probably take that down. 2.

I (22M) have a friend, Sarah (21F), who I've known since high school. We've always had a close friendship, but recently, things have gotten a little complicated. Sarah started an OnlyFans account a few months ago. She's always been pretty open about her life and choices, so I wasn't too shocked when she mentioned it in passing. However, she wasn't aware that some of our mutual friends were also subscribed to her.

The thing is, one of our mutual friends, Emily (22F), has been feeling a bit off about Sarah's new venture. Emily isn't judgmental per se, but she has a more traditional view of relationships and self-presentation, and she’s expressed discomfort with only feeling like she knows half of what’s going on in Sarah’s life. Recently, she told me that she’s been questioning whether she should confront Sarah about it. She thinks Sarah might be putting herself at risk in some way, and it would be better for her to know that it’s out there and that some of our friends are aware.

I find myself caught in the middle. I care about both of them, and I get where Emily is coming from. I understand her concern for our friend, but I also don’t want to be the one who ends up causing unnecessary drama. If I were to tell Sarah that Emily knows about her OnlyFans, it might lead to a confrontation or even hurt feelings. But I also feel that Sarah has a right to know if people close to her might be discussing it behind her back.

I haven’t said anything to either of them yet. Emily thinks it would be a good idea to approach Sarah, but I’m hesitant about that. I’m not sure if it would be better for me to stay out of it or if I should talk to Sarah directly about the fact that Emily is aware.

Neither Sarah nor Emily is in the wrong for how they feel, but I feel guilty for potentially keeping a secret from one of my closest friends. Am I the asshole for even considering telling Sarah about her OnlyFans account being known among our friends?","So, this situation has been weighing on my mind, and I really need some perspective on whether I'm doing the right thing.

One of my closest friends, let's call her Sarah (26F), has recently started an OnlyFans account. I found out about it accidentally when a mutual acquaintance mentioned it in passing. To be clear, I have zero negative feelings about people using OnlyFans or any other platform to make money. It's her body, her choice, and I support that fully.

However, the issue arises because Sarah hasn't told me or our close friend group about her OnlyFans. We typically share pretty much everything about our lives, so this came as a bit of a surprise. I started worrying that maybe she felt embarrassed or thought we would judge her, which is absolutely not the case.

I've been wrestling with whether or not to bring this up with her. On one hand, I want her to know that I support her and that she doesn't need to hide this part of her life from me. On the other hand, I worry that bringing it up might make her feel awkward or invade her privacy. She has every right to keep this to herself if she wants to, and I don't want to push her into a corner where she feels she has to explain herself.

I spoke to a couple of friends about it, and they had mixed opinions. Some thought it was my duty as a friend to let her know I support her and to ensure she doesn't feel isolated. Others argued that if she wanted to share this part of her life, she would do it in her own time and on her own terms. Confronting her about it might just make things weird between us.

For now, I've decided to just act normal and continue supporting her like I always do. But the concern and conflict in my mind still persist. I want to be a good friend but without overstepping boundaries. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for considering bringing up Sarah's OnlyFans account with her?"

We communicate well, and I thought we understood each other's boundaries. Recently, however, something happened that really shook me.

A few days ago, I was venting to him about a difficult situation I was having at work. It was a private conversation, and I was sharing my feelings, frustrations, and some personal details about why I was feeling overwhelmed. I trusted him to keep that information just between us, especially since it was quite sensitive.

To my shock, later that week, he mentioned to me that he had shared some of the things I said with his boss. He claimed that he did it to ""get advice"" on how to deal with similar situations since he thought I was being too hard on myself. I was taken aback. I felt completely betrayed; the conversation was supposed to be private, and I didn't give him permission to share it. 

When I confronted him, he downplayed my feelings, saying I was overreacting because it was all in a professional context and that his boss ""wouldn't think less of me."" I just couldn't believe he didn't see how sharing my personal struggles felt like a violation of trust. My friends think I’m justified in being upset and that it's important for couples to be able to share their feelings without fear of being outed, but he insists it was done with good intentions.

Now, there seems to be a bit of distance between us. I feel uncomfortable talking about personal matters, and while I don’t want to end things over this, I can’t shake off the feeling of betrayal. I’ve been wondering if my reaction was too extreme. 

So, AITA for getting upset with my boyfriend for sharing my private conversation with his boss?","My boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) have been together for three years. He recently got a promotion at his job, and his boss has been taking a lot of interest in him, even inviting him out for drinks and weekend activities. I know he’s excited about these new opportunities, but something happened recently that has me really upset.

Last Wednesday, I had a rough day at work and came home feeling stressed and overwhelmed. I poured my heart out to my boyfriend about how I was feeling underappreciated at my job and how my coworkers were making my life difficult. He was very supportive and listened to everything I had to say.

Fast forward to Friday night, my boyfriend and I went out for drinks with some of his coworkers, including his boss. At one point, the conversation turned to work-related stress, and my boyfriend decided it was a great idea to share the details of my tough week, including the private conversation we had. He joked about how I was ""losing it"" at work and how dramatic I was being. I was mortified and felt completely betrayed.

I confronted him about it afterward and told him that it was incredibly inappropriate to share something so private, especially in front of people I barely knew. He apologized but then said I was overreacting and that it wasn’t a big deal. He argued that he was trying to connect with his boss and coworkers and that they didn’t take it seriously anyway. He said something about how I ""need to lighten up"" and that I was making something small into a big issue.

I told my friends about this, and they had mixed reactions. Some said they understood why I was hurt, but others agreed with my boyfriend and said it wasn’t worth causing a big fight over. Now, my boyfriend is being distant, and I’m wondering if I really did overreact. 

So, AITA for getting upset when my boyfriend shared our private conversation with his boss?

Edit: Wow, thanks for the feedback. It’s clear I have some thinking to do. I guess I didn’t consider how he might have seen my reaction. We’ll need to have a serious conversation about boundaries."

We turned 16 a few weeks ago, and in our family, birthdays are a big deal. Traditionally, we each get a thoughtful gift from our parents, but I never expected the gift exchange to spark this much tension.

When I opened my birthday present, I found a brand-new tablet. It wasn’t just any tablet; it's the most expensive model on the market. I was initially excited, but then I realized my brother got the same exact gift last year. I couldn’t help but feel a little frustrated—after all, we’re twins, and I thought we were supposed to have separate identities, including our birthday gifts. I felt like I was being shortchanged because I didn’t get something unique to me.

Later that evening, while talking to my friends, I expressed my feelings about the gift and how I thought I deserved something a bit more special, considering it was my 16th birthday. They were divided—some agreed that I should have gotten a more personalized gift, while others told me that it was selfish to think that way when a tablet is still a substantial gift.

When we had dinner that night, I brought it up with my parents, explaining that I felt a bit entitled to something different and more “me.” My dad just looked at me, surprised, and said that it was unreasonable to expect a more expensive gift when the one I received was already a luxury. He reminded me that the tablet was a great gift and that I should be grateful, but I didn’t feel like I could just let it go.

After dinner, my mom came to speak with me privately. She said that my reaction was disappointing and that I shouldn’t compare myself to my brother. She suggested I focus on being thankful for what I had. I felt really conflicted because I didn’t mean to offend anyone, but I still felt like I deserved something different.

So, am I the asshole for feeling entitled to a more expensive and unique gift since my twin got a tablet?","I (16F) have a twin brother, Alex. We generally get along great, but the past few weeks have created some tension. Our birthday was last month, and our parents usually try to keep things fair between us, making sure we get similar gifts or experiences. This year, however, things were quite different.

On the morning of our birthday, we both received our gifts. I got a beautiful necklace and a few books I had been wanting, while Alex got a brand-new tablet. I was happy with my gifts at first, but as the day went on, I couldn't help but feel a bit resentful. The tablet was clearly much more expensive than my gifts combined. 

During the family dinner that night, I brought up my feelings. I told my parents I felt it was unfair that Alex received a significantly more expensive gift and that I should have received something of equal value. My dad explained that Alex had been saving up for the tablet for months and only needed a little extra to afford it, so they decided to give him the tablet as a combined gift and reward for his hard work. They also mentioned that I could always save up for something I really wanted, and they would consider helping me out as well.

Still, this didn't sit well with me. I felt like they favored Alex, and I was hurt that they didn't think to balance out the costs of our gifts. I ended up sulking for the rest of the evening, which caused a bit of an awkward atmosphere.

My friends are divided on this. Some agree with me and think it's unfair, while others believe I was being entitled and should be grateful for what I received. My parents were clearly disappointed in my reaction, and Alex barely speaks to me now unless necessary. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for feeling entitled to more expensive gifts since my twin got a tablet?"

The whole process of saying goodbye was overwhelming and the grief hit me harder than I expected. After the funeral, I felt a wave of emotions crashing down on me, and unfortunately, I let my frustrations spill over into my daily life.

One day, while I was out for a walk to clear my head, I came across a stray cat. It was meowing loudly and looked like it was in rough shape. Instead of feeling compassion for it, I felt all my pent-up anger and sadness bubbling to the surface. Without really thinking, I kicked some dirt at the cat, hoping it would just go away. It ran off, and I felt even worse, but I couldn't shake this overwhelming sense of annoyance and helplessness.

Later that week, my siblings (28F and 25M) asked me if I’d like to help them choose a pet for their new apartment. I immediately shot them down, saying that we shouldn't adopt an animal when there are so many issues in the world to deal with. They just wanted a companion to help them deal with their own stress, but I couldn't see past my grief and kept insisting that they should wait and reconsider, acting like having a pet was irresponsible.

My siblings were disappointed and hurt by my reaction, and they've since decided to hold off on getting a pet, which has seemed to drag out their own sadness. They talked about how my reaction made them feel guilty even wanting a cat or dog, and honestly, I can see now how selfish I was being. They just wanted something to care for and love during a tough time, and I took that away from them out of my own anger and frustration.

I feel terrible about how I treated that stray cat and how it affected my siblings. I know now that I shouldn’t have allowed my grief to manifest in such a harmful way. I’ve apologized to my siblings, but I still can’t shake the feeling that, by taking out my emotions on that cat and discouraging their plans, I somehow ruined something for them. AITA for how I acted?","I (35F) recently lost my beloved dog, Max, who had been with me for over 10 years. Max was practically family, and his passing hit me hard. During this tough time, a stray cat started hanging around my backyard. I was in no mood to care for another animal so soon, and I found its presence irritating rather than comforting. I shooed it away every chance I got. 

My younger siblings (18M and 20F) still live with our parents and have been begging for years to get a pet, but our parents have always been on the fence about it. Recently, they seemed to be warming up to the idea. My siblings visited me a lot after Max's death to offer support, and they noticed the stray cat at my place. They fell in love with it instantly and convinced our parents to meet the cat in hopes of adopting it.

I can't explain it, but seeing them so happy about the cat felt like a betrayal to Max. I told my parents that the cat was a nuisance, always digging in the trash and being a general pest. I exaggerated its behavior and told them it would be too much trouble. I even mentioned that the cat might have diseases, which scared them off. I knew my siblings were really looking forward to it, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was too soon for another pet in our family.

My siblings were devastated when my parents decided against adopting the cat. They tried to change their minds, but my parents stood firm, largely based on my exaggerated claims. My siblings found out that I had influenced our parents' decision and are now furious with me, accusing me of taking out my grief on the cat and ruining their chances of having a pet.

I feel guilty now, seeing how upset they are. The stray cat still roams the neighborhood, and my siblings won’t speak to me. I realize I might have let my grief cloud my judgment. So, AITA for taking out my grief on a stray cat and making it difficult for my siblings to get a pet?"

Fake names.\n\nI (37 F) decided a couple months ago with my husband (40 M) that it was time to get our kids a dog because they were old enough to care for one. My kids are Rose (8 F) and Isabella (10 F). My husband had a boxer as a kid and said that he has fond memories with that kind of dog so we decided to get one and surprise the kids. He is now five months old. I\'m sure many of you will understand that because he is a puppy he needs a lot of exercise because he is very high energy. We often take him on walks at the park near our house because it has several very long walking paths.\n\nWell, this past weekend there was an event going on at the lower half of the park, so it was closed off so all we had left was the top half. It was just me and my daughter Rose because my husband had to pick up Isabella from a friend\'s house. While at the park my daughter kept begging me to hold Coopers leash. After a while I gave in. While Rose was walking him another dog came by and Cooper got excited and started running over which pulled my daughter who let go of the leash. Cooper ran over to the other dog trying to play and all of a sudden I heard screaming at me to ""get my dog"". My daughter ran over and started crying while the girl (2oish F?) held her dog down with her arm in his mouth and screamed at me to stop standing there. The man with her started yelling at me to stop my dog who was jumping with excitement. After the shock wore off, I rushed over and removed my dog checking Cooper and Rose. The man with her started yelling at me that I was being irresponsible by letting the dog walk free in a leash required area and that people like them take their rescues there for training and I probably just destroyed months work of progress with their dog. I explained he was being held but my daughter dropped by accident and that he needed to stop yelling as it was scaring my kid. He started yelling that if my daughter wasn\'t strong enough to hold the dog she shouldn\'t be walking it or take it to a unleashed area to practice. When we got home Rose was still crying. When my husband asked what happened and I told him, he was angry at me telling me that I need to be more responsible and that I was at fault. I told my mother about it and she told me that dogs like the girls shouldn\'t be allowed to go to parks and I agree.

Growing up, she was often critical and dismissive of my choices, which really shaped how I view our interactions today. Recently, we had a big fight that seemed to push everything over the edge. 

A few months ago, I decided to take a big step in my life and quit my job to pursue my passion for photography full-time. It wasn’t an easy decision, and I did a lot of research and planning before making it. When I told my mom, instead of being supportive, she immediately accused me of being irresponsible and implied that I was throwing my life away. She went on to say that I'd be living in her basement in no time if I didn't get my act together. 

That hurt a lot. I had really put my heart into this decision and hoped for some encouragement, but all I got was judgment. Our conversation spiraled into a big argument, and I ended up telling her that I didn’t want her negativity in my life anymore. It was an emotional moment for both of us, and I hung up feeling pretty drained.

Since then, I've definitely been holding a grudge. I haven't reached out to her or responded to her texts, and whenever we do see each other at family gatherings, I find myself being cold and distant. I know some family members have noticed the tension because my mom has reached out to them, expressing her hurt feelings. Some relatives have told me that I need to let it go, that she's still my mother, and that we should just move past it. 

On the other hand, my best friend is more in tune with my feelings and thinks that I have every right to feel upset and to take my time in healing from our argument. She says it’s okay to stand my ground when it comes to my choices, especially since I've been so hurt by my mom’s reaction. 

I’ve been wrestling with whether I’m being too harsh. Part of me feels justified in being distant, while the other part worries that I'm just making things worse. I don't want to hurt her, but I also want her to understand the impact of her words. AITA for holding onto this grudge and being cold to my mom after our argument?","I (24 F) have always had a somewhat rocky relationship with my mom (45 F). We tend to clash over various things, but this particular incident has really driven a wedge between us. The fight happened about four months ago, and it's still affecting our relationship.

A bit of context: I'm very particular about my personal space and privacy. I live in a small apartment, and my mom tends to drop by unannounced quite frequently. I've asked her multiple times to call or text before coming over, but she often ignores this request. This has always been a point of contention between us.

Four months ago, I was having a terrible week. Work was stressful, my boyfriend and I had just had a huge argument, and I was feeling incredibly overwhelmed. I desperately needed some time alone to decompress. My mom, of course, decided to drop by without warning. I was in no mood to entertain anyone, let alone deal with her tendency to get overly involved in my personal life.

When she walked in, I snapped. I told her she had no respect for my boundaries and that I needed her to leave immediately. My tone was harsh, and I could see the hurt in her eyes, but I didn't care at that moment. She left without saying much, and I thought that was the end of it.

Since that day, I've been cold and distant towards her. I didn't reach out, and I avoided her calls and messages. When we did speak, I was curt and uninterested. My mom tried to apologize several times, but I brushed her off each time, convinced that she needed to learn a lesson about respecting my boundaries.

Friends and family have weighed in on the situation. My best friend thinks I'm being too harsh, and my aunt said I should let it go because ""life is too short for grudges."" Even my boyfriend, who has had his own issues with his parents, thinks I'm overreacting. My mom, on the other hand, has stopped trying to reach out as much, probably sensing my frosty attitude.

The current outcome is that our relationship is more strained than ever. Family gatherings are awkward, and there's a palpable tension whenever we're in the same room. My siblings have noticed and have started to take sides, making things even more complicated.

I can't shake the feeling that I'm in the right for wanting my personal space respected, but I'm starting to wonder if I've taken it too far by holding onto this grudge for so long. Am I the asshole for holding a months-long grudge and being cold to my mom after that fight?"

A little background: my stepmother married into a new family a few years ago, which included my ex-stepbrother, Jake (28). Things didn’t end well between us when my parents divorced, and I really distanced myself from the whole situation. Despite the awkwardness, I tried to keep things civil when we did run into each other, but we never really had a relationship.

Last weekend, I found out through a mutual friend that Jake was throwing a party to celebrate his recent promotion, and he had invited a bunch of people, including some from our shared past. I wasn’t invited, but honestly, I couldn't help feeling a little miffed. I decided to go, not to reconnect but to make a point and just be confrontational. I had a grudge against Jake and wanted to let loose a bit at his expense.

So, I showed up uninvited, and when I walked into the party, I spotted one of his friends, who had previously bullied me in high school. That was it; I couldn’t hold back. I started yelling at this guy, calling him out for his past behavior and basically ruining the vibe of the party. Everyone turned to stare, and it was super awkward. Jake tried to intervene, but I was too fired up to listen.

To say the least, the party ended on a sour note. People were uncomfortable, and I ended up leaving after making a scene. The fallout has been a mess. Some friends texted me saying I crossed a line, while others thought I was justified for standing up for myself. Jake called me afterward, furious, and said I made a fool of myself and embarrassed him in front of his guests, which I’ll admit did hit me hard. 

Looking back, I realize that my anger got the best of me, and I could have handled the situation differently. Was I really justified in my actions, or did I just make myself look bad? AITA for showing up uninvited to my ex-stepbrother's party and yelling at his guest?","Okay, so here's the backstory. I used to have a stepbrother, Tom (28), but our parents divorced last year, and since then, we haven't really kept in touch. Despite the divorce, I still consider him family, and I recently found out he was having a big party to celebrate his promotion at work. I wasn't invited, which kinda stung, but I figured it was just an oversight.

I decided to show up anyway because, hey, family is family, right? I thought it would be a nice surprise. When I got there, it was clear Tom was not expecting me. He looked a bit uncomfortable but tried to be polite. I mingled for a while, but then I saw a guest, Mark, who had a history with me. He was friends with my ex and had been a major instigator in spreading rumors about our breakup.

Seeing Mark and knowing what he did infuriated me. I lost my temper and confronted him, yelling about all the things he'd done to ruin my previous relationship. The whole party came to a standstill, and Tom intervened, asking me to leave. I was fuming and felt completely justified in calling Mark out for his actions.

Afterwards, I got several angry messages from Tom and some of his friends, accusing me of ruining the party and causing a scene. Tom said I was out of line for showing up uninvited and making a public spectacle. He even mentioned that Mark had apologized for his past behavior and they were trying to move on.

My close friends are divided on this. Some say I was right to stand up for myself, while others think I should've let it go and not crashed the party in the first place. I'm still upset about what happened, but I'm starting to wonder if I was really in the wrong here.

So, AITA for showing up uninvited to my ex-stepbrother's party and yelling at his guest?"

About 4 years ago she met my now stepdad (Dave fake name) and about 2 years ago we moved in with him at his house. Dave has a brother (fake name will be John) that has been helping with projects around the house for the past 3-4 months.

However this is where my mom and I start to have problems. John is still doing more projects. We thought he would be gone by now. He usually gets there at around 7-8 in the morning and stays until 5-6 working on things. So he does not stay over night, but my mom gets annoyed when he tries to insert himself into my mom and stepdads  relaxing time at the end of the day. Dave has no problems with John being there. It’s his house so he can have whoever he wants over. My mom just wants to have privacy which I agree with. I’m tired of having him sit around all the time (which he has started to do.) My mom is getting annoyed with him. We are thankful for all the help John has given us but I feel as though he needs to respect that my mom doesn’t want him over every day. It gets annoying when I wake up to drilling and hammering in the morning but by noon he just sits around and sometimes does some work. Dave gets mad anytime we say something about it. I’m not allowed to speak of it at all. My mom and I are just tired of having John over almost every day of the week.

I do plan to move out soon I am trying to work to save money. My mom has expressed she doesn’t like him being around all the time. She has tried to tell Dave many times. John has helped with all the important things already, he is doing stuff like building things outside that we didn’t need now. He is at the house almost every day and most days he isn’t doing anything. My mom also pays for a least half of the bills and expenses is what she told me. She also buys all the groceries and does the cleaning.

I love my family, but I've also been working hard to create a comfortable living space for myself in our home. My stepdad has a brother (let’s call him Mark) who comes over frequently, sometimes unannounced. I’ve always found Mark a bit overbearing and invasive, but it's never been a huge issue—just mildly irritating.

The situation escalated recently when Mark began to disregard my boundaries entirely. For instance, he would let himself into my space without knocking, help himself to my things without asking, and make comments about my personal life and choices that were really uncomfortable to hear. I had a couple of conversations with my mom and stepdad expressing how I felt, asking them to please talk to Mark about respecting my space and boundaries. They agreed to do so, but it only seemed to make matters worse.

One evening, Mark came over uninvited while I was in the middle of a personal video call. He barged into my room without knocking, loudly cracking jokes about my call, which left me feeling exposed and disrespected. I finally snapped and told him that he needed to knock and respect my space, and that it wasn’t his house to treat as he pleased. 

This led to an awkward situation during dinner where my stepdad and mom seemed tense. They both told me that I was being too harsh and that Mark was just trying to be friendly. They think I should lighten up and let it go because ""he means well."" I feel like I stand my ground for my own comfort, but I also don’t want to create tension in the family.

Now, I find myself questioning if I overreacted. I really believe that everyone should respect each other's boundaries in shared spaces, but I worry I may have come off as rude. Am I the asshole for wanting my stepdad's brother to respect our boundaries in our own home?","My husband and I recently moved into our first home together after saving up for years. It's a cozy little place, and we're both really excited to make it our own. My mom remarried a few years ago, and her husband, Tom, has a younger brother, Rick. Rick has always seemed like a nice enough guy, but he's a bit of a free spirit and tends to be a bit of a nomad, bouncing between different relatives’ homes.

About two weeks ago, Tom asked if Rick could stay with us for a little while because he was between jobs and needed a place to crash. We agreed, thinking it would only be for a short period. Initially, everything was fine, but then things started to go downhill.

Rick has a habit of leaving dirty dishes everywhere, tracking mud into the house, and he never seems to clean up after himself. He also has this annoying tendency to play his music loudly at all hours of the night, which makes it difficult for us to sleep. We've tried talking to him about it, but he just nods and says he’ll do better, then goes right back to his old ways.

The last straw was when he invited a couple of his friends over without asking us first. They were loud, stayed late, and left a mess for us to clean up the next morning. I was furious and told Rick he needed to start respecting our boundaries if he wanted to continue staying with us. He brushed it off, saying we were being too uptight.

I talked to my mom about it, and she thinks I'm overreacting and that I should cut Rick some slack since he's going through a tough time. Tom agreed with my mom, suggesting that Rick just needs more time to adjust. My husband, on the other hand, is on my side and feels that Rick has overstayed his welcome and needs to either shape up or ship out.

I confronted Rick again, and this time I was firmer, telling him he had one week to either start respecting our home or find somewhere else to stay. Rick got upset and told my mom what I said. Now, my mom and Tom are upset with me, saying I’m being heartless and not giving Rick enough support.

While I feel bad because I don't want to cause family drama, I also feel like our home should be a place where we feel comfortable and respected. So, AITA for wanting my stepdad’s brother to respect our boundaries in our own home?"

She’s traditionally very frugal and has a strong opinion about money, often talking about how I should be saving and not wasting. Recently, I bought a pair of shoes for £13. They were meant to be a casual option for running errands and hanging out with friends. 

A few days after I got them, I noticed that they were already falling apart. The sole had started to come off, and every step I took made a weird squeaking noise as if they were having a breakdown. I didn’t want to keep wearing them, so I decided to throw them away to avoid the embarrassment of wearing shoes that looked like they belonged in the trash.

When my mom found out, she blew up at me. She yelled about how I wasted money and should have kept the shoes until I could find a way to fix them. I got really frustrated, and in the heat of the moment, I told her that £13 wasn’t worth keeping shoes that were clearly defective. I added that I wouldn’t be ashamed to throw away something that wasn’t serving me anymore.

Her yelling continued, insisting that I was wasteful and should have at least tried to fix them. In my defense, I said that I didn’t want to waste my time or money on something that was clearly not worth it. It became a huge argument, and she eventually stormed off, still muttering about my wastefulness.

Some friends think I was in the right because the shoes were worthless, but others say I could have handled my mom’s reaction better, especially since she was upset about money. I’ve never been great at dealing with her when she gets in one of her moods, but I really did feel justified in my actions. 

So, AITA for throwing away the £13 shoes and then standing up for myself when my mom yelled at me?","I (16F) recently had a major fallout with my mum over a pair of shoes, and I need some perspective on whether I'm truly in the wrong here. So here's the full story.

For context, money has always been tight in our household. My mum works incredibly hard to make ends meet, and we don't have the luxury of splurging on non-essential items. Recently, I saved up some pocket money and bought myself a pair of shoes for £13. They weren't anything fancy, just a pair of trendy sneakers that I liked and could wear to school.

About two weeks after I got them, I noticed they were already falling apart. The soles had started to come off, and the fabric was tearing. I was really disappointed because £13 is a lot of money for me, and I expected them to last longer. Frustrated, I decided to just throw them away. I didn't see the point in keeping shoes that were practically unusable.

When my mum found out, she went ballistic. She started yelling at me, saying how wasteful I was and that I should have at least tried to fix them or repurpose them in some way. I tried to explain that they were beyond repair and that I didn't want to keep something that was falling apart, but she was having none of it. She accused me of being irresponsible with money and not appreciating the value of things.

In my defense, I pointed out that I had saved up my own money to buy the shoes and that it was my decision to get rid of them. I also mentioned that sometimes cheap shoes just don't last, and it's not always something you can fix. This only made her angrier, and she said I was being disrespectful and defiant.

The argument escalated to the point where we were both shouting at each other. My mum ended up grounding me for a week, saying I needed to learn a lesson about value and respect. Now, I'm feeling a mix of guilt and frustration. On one hand, I understand that money is tight and I should be more careful with my purchases. On the other hand, I feel like I had the right to throw away something that was no longer usable, especially since it was my own money.

So, AITA for throwing away the £13 shoes and defending myself against my mum's yelling?"

He’s a great guy, but he has this habit of wearing his neon safety vest everywhere. He works in construction, so I get that he wears it on the job, but outside of work? It’s like he thinks it’s acceptable to throw it on for a casual outing. We live in a small town, so I understand the vest sometimes blends into his environment, but it’s still a neon yellow, and I can’t help but feel it looks ridiculous.

The other day, we had planned a nice dinner out with some friends. I was really looking forward to it, and I dressed up in a cute outfit. When he showed up wearing that damn neon vest over his nice shirt, I couldn’t help but cringe. I love this guy, but I also want him to look presentable when we're out in public. I jokingly told him he looked like a crossing guard and that he should consider swapping it for a nice jacket. He laughed it off at first, but when I continued to poke fun at it (I may have gone a little overboard), he seemed to take it to heart. 

My friends were split. Some thought I was being too harsh and that it was just his way of dressing comfortably, while others agreed with me that he should be more mindful of how he presents himself, especially when we’re out. After our dinner, he seemed a bit distant and mentioned he doesn’t think my comments about his vest are funny anymore.

The thing is, I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. I just thought that we could be that couple that looks good together, you know? Now I’m questioning if I should’ve just let it go and accepted that he likes his vest. I also feel bad because I feel like I made a big deal over something that doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things.

So, am I the asshole for making a big deal out of my boyfriend’s neon safety vest?","I've been dating my boyfriend, Matt, for about a year now. Matt is a construction worker, and his job requires him to wear a neon safety vest. The vest itself isn't the problem; it's that he often forgets to take it off when we go out right after work. He'll wear it to dinner, to the movies, even when we're running errands. I understand he's probably tired after work, but it's embarrassing to be seen with him looking like he just came from a construction site all the time.

The other night, we had plans to meet some friends for dinner. Matt showed up in his neon vest again. I pulled him aside and asked him politely if he could leave it in the car. His response was that it's just easier to keep it on in case he needs to head back to work for any reason. I couldn't help but feel like he wasn't considering how I felt about it, and I told him so. We had a bit of an argument, and eventually, he agreed to take it off, but not without making a comment about how silly I was being.

Our friends noticed the tension and asked what had happened. When I explained, they seemed split. Some agreed with Matt, saying it wasn't a big deal, while others said they understood why I'd be bothered. Since then, Matt has been somewhat distant and keeps bringing up the vest in a joking manner, clearly still annoyed by the whole incident.

I talked to my sister about it, and she thinks I was being too uptight and that it's just a vest—it shouldn't matter. On the other hand, I feel like it's a respect thing. If he cared about my feelings, he would take it off without making a fuss. 

So now I'm wondering, AITA for making a big deal out of my boyfriend's neon safety vest?"

With a busy life as a working mom of a 1.5-year-old, I don’t often get the chance to pamper myself. So, I scheduled a long-overdue hair appointment for the morning of my birthday, thinking it would be the perfect way to start the day.

I reached out to my mom, who lives nearby, to ask if she could watch my little one for a couple of hours while I got my hair done. I figured it would be a great opportunity for her to spend some quality time with her grandchild as well. However, my mom hesitated and expressed that it might be too much for her, even for just a couple of hours. She mentioned that she had her own plans for the day, which I completely understood.

In the end, I decided to go ahead with the appointment and lined up a babysitter instead. My mom then seemed a bit offended that I didn’t wait for her to give me a definite answer before making other arrangements. She pointed out that it was my birthday and that she would have loved to help, but I just wasn’t sure how much time I could wait since the appointment slots fill up quickly and I wanted to treat myself.

Now, my mom and some close friends have mixed feelings about the situation. Some think I should have waited for her response out of respect, while others believe I was right to prioritize my self-care and the appointment since it could be rescheduled at a later date. The tension has led to some awkward conversations, and I don’t want this to affect our relationship.

I genuinely wanted my mom to be involved, but I also needed to take care of myself. So, am I the asshole for asking my mom to babysit on my birthday for a hair appointment?","Hey everyone, I (28F) have a bit of a dilemma and need an outside perspective. My birthday is coming up next week, and as a little treat for myself, I booked a hair appointment at my favorite salon. It’s a bit of a splurge, but I’ve been feeling the need for some self-care. The appointment is for a couple of hours, and it’s really the only “me time” I get.

For context, I have a 1.5-year-old son who is an absolute joy but, as any parent knows, he’s a handful. My mom (54F) is usually very helpful with babysitting, but she has her own things going on and isn’t always available on short notice. I asked her a few days ago if she could watch my son for a couple of hours on my birthday so I could go to this hair appointment. She seemed hesitant because she’s had a busy week and mentioned she might want to relax that day. I could tell she felt guilty even considering saying no, which made me feel horrible for asking in the first place.

From her perspective, she’s already done so much for me and my son, and I totally get why she might want a break. On the other hand, it’s my birthday, and this appointment means a lot to me. I don’t have many other options for babysitters, and I don’t want to seem ungrateful or imposing.

To complicate things, my friends and family are divided on this issue. Some of them think it’s totally reasonable for me to ask her to babysit for a couple of hours on my birthday. Others think I might be expecting too much, given that she has her own life and deserves her downtime. My husband can’t take the day off work, so he’s not available to help either.

Now I’m stuck in this weird limbo where I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable. I don’t want to make my mom feel pressured, but I also don’t want to cancel my plans if I don’t have to. 

So, AITA for asking my mom to watch my 1.5-year-old on my birthday for a hair appointment?"

We (f26), me and my boyfriend (m23) have recently moved into a nice home located on a riverside. We have no neighbors in front of us, only to the side and behind. Our neighbors to our right live in a Triplex, three families one roof. A few weeks ago, one of the neighbors friend started to park in front of our house. We didn\'t know it was them until my BF, who knows one of the girls living in the triplex, asked them if they knew who this unknown large black truck belonged to.

I've always been the type of student who tries really hard but struggles with certain subjects, especially math and science. I put in hours of studying, but my grades just never seem to reflect the effort I put in. My mom (f45) has always been very academic-oriented and puts a lot of pressure on me to excel. She's a straight-A student herself, and while I admire her work ethic, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by her expectations.

Last week, I had a particularly stressful night studying for a math exam. I was feeling lost and anxious, and despite trying to focus, I just couldn't get it. The next day, I failed the test. When I came home, my mom was upset and immediately started lecturing me about how I need to apply myself more and how I’m wasting my potential. I completely understand that she means well, but in that moment, I felt overwhelmed and defeated. I snapped and yelled at her, telling her that I already feel awful and that her comments weren't helping at all.

After I yelled, she got really hurt and said that I was being disrespectful. I immediately regretted how I reacted because that wasn’t my intention; I just felt like I was being attacked when I was already down. I tried to apologize later, but I could tell she was still upset.

Friends of mine think my mom is being a bit harsh and that it’s understandable to get frustrated when you’re under so much pressure. Others say that I crossed a line by yelling at her and should have communicated my feelings more calmly. My mom, however, insists that I need to learn to take responsibility for my actions and that I shouldn't have reacted that way. 

Looking back, I see both sides of the argument. I don't want to blame her for caring about my education, but I also don't want to feel like a failure for struggling. Am I the asshole for yelling at my mom when she got mad at me for struggling in school?","I (17F) have been struggling in school for the past few months. I've been dealing with a lot of stress from extracurricular activities, college applications, and trying to keep up with my part-time job. My grades have been slipping, and I've been overwhelmed trying to balance everything. 

My mom (45F) is a very high-achieving person. She always excelled in her career and had high expectations for me. She would often tell me about how she managed to get straight A's while working two jobs and still having a social life. She believes that if she could do it, I should be able to as well.

Last week, I got back a math test that I didn’t do well on. I knew it wasn't my best work, but I genuinely tried my hardest given the circumstances. When I showed my mom, she was livid. She started yelling at me, asking why I wasn't doing better and accusing me of not trying hard enough. Feeling cornered and frustrated, I tried to explain how stressed I was and how hard I was working just to keep my head above water. 

But she kept pushing, telling me that I was making excuses and that I needed to get my act together. In the heat of the moment, I snapped and yelled back at her, telling her she had no idea how hard things were for me and that she wasn't helping by putting more pressure on me. She looked shocked and hurt, and without another word, she walked away and hasn’t spoken much to me since.

My younger sister (14F) overheard the fight and told me later that she understood where I was coming from and that Mom can be really tough sometimes. On the other hand, my dad (46M) thinks I was completely out of line for yelling at her and that I should apologize immediately. Some of my friends think that I stood up for myself and that my mom needed a reality check, but others say that yelling at your parents is never okay, regardless of the situation.

Now there's this tense atmosphere at home, and I don’t know how to fix it. I'm starting to feel guilty about the way I reacted, but I also feel like my mom wasn't listening to me at all.

Am I the asshole for yelling at my mom when she got mad at me for struggling in school?"

For some context, I have a close group of friends, and one of them, let’s call her Sarah, recently got a puppy. The first couple of months were great; she took the puppy out, trained her, and seemed genuinely excited about owning a dog. However, as time went on, I noticed that the excitement faded, and the puppy was left alone for hours on end. Sarah started to cancel plans because she ""couldn’t leave the dog alone,"" but it became clear that she wasn’t really taking care of the little one.

I tried talking to her about it—suggesting she look into doggy daycare options or even hiring a dog walker. She always brushed me off, saying things like, “I’ll get it together soon,” or “It’s just a phase.” Meanwhile, I’d see social media posts of her going out and having fun while the puppy was left in a crate for most of the day. It broke my heart.

One day, I went over to visit, and the puppy was visibly distressed. She was whining and had made a mess in her crate. I couldn’t just stand by and do nothing. After talking to a few other friends who felt the same way, I made the impulsive decision to take the puppy home with me. I thought I could take care of her temporarily until Sarah got her act together.

I texted Sarah to let her know what I’d done, thinking she’d understand that it was for the puppy’s sake. Boy, was I wrong. She exploded in anger, demanding that I bring her back immediately. I tried to explain my reasoning—how the puppy deserves a loving and caring environment, but she wouldn’t hear it. She accused me of stealing her dog and threatened to report me. 

Now, I get why she would be upset, and I understand that I should have asked for her permission. But the situation didn’t feel right to me, and I thought I was acting in the best interest of the puppy. Some of our other friends think I was justified, but the majority say I overstepped and should have left it alone.

So, I’m sitting here wondering: AITA for taking the neglected dog from my friend’s house without their permission?","I (28F) have a group of friends that I’ve known since college, and we often hang out at each other's places. One of my friends, Lisa (27F), has had a dog, Max, for about two years now. Over time, it became clear to me that Lisa wasn’t taking proper care of Max. She would often leave him alone for long hours with little food, fresh water, or attention. When we visited, Max would be visibly stressed, and sometimes aggressive, likely due to the neglect.

On numerous occasions, I tried talking to Lisa about Max’s welfare. I even offered to help walk him or take care of him when she was busy, but she always brushed me off or got defensive, saying she was doing her best and that I should mind my own business. This went on for months, and nothing seemed to change; if anything, Max’s condition appeared to worsen. 

Last weekend, we all gathered at Lisa’s place for a get-together. I arrived early and witnessed Max in an even more distressing state than usual. He looked thinner, his fur was matted, and he seemed dehydrated. I couldn’t bear to see him suffering, so when everyone was distracted, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took Max, put him in my car, and drove him to my house. I left a note for Lisa explaining that I took Max because I was worried about his wellbeing.

When Lisa discovered Max was gone, she was furious. She called me immediately, screaming and demanding that I bring Max back. I tried to explain my concerns, offering to help her find a better solution for Max’s care, but she wasn't having it. Our mutual friends are divided on the issue. Some agree with Lisa, saying it wasn’t my place to take her dog without permission, while others think I did the right thing given the circumstances. Now, Lisa is threatening to call the police on me for stealing her dog, and our friendship group is in turmoil.

Currently, Max is staying with me, and I’ve made an appointment for him at the vet to get checked out. I truly believe I acted in Max’s best interest, but I can’t ignore the fact that I took him without Lisa’s consent, and now there’s a rift in our friendship group. 

So, AITA for taking a neglected dog from my friend's house without their permission?"

With COVID-19 still a concern, we both agreed to celebrate in smaller ways—less crowded events and more individual celebrations in safe spaces. However, Sarah brought up that she was planning to have a few close friends over for a small get-together and a bit of trick-or-treating with her kids.

As we talked, I mentioned that I live in a really busy neighborhood where kids flood in on Halloween, and with social distancing being a priority, I was a little anxious about the crowding at my house. So, I casually asked Sarah if she’d be open to letting me park in her driveway for the evening. The plan was that I’d get to her house early and help out with the kids' festivities, but I wanted to ensure that I had a safe place to park without contributing to the street crowding.

Sarah paused for a moment and then said she’d prefer not to, citing that she wanted to keep her driveway clear for any other guests and didn’t want to add more to the mix of our pandemic concerns. I totally understood her feelings since she has young kids and safety is a top priority for her.

I felt a bit awkward after asking, and I wondered if I had overstepped by making that request. I didn’t want to put her in an uncomfortable position or make her feel like she couldn’t say no. But at the same time, it was frustrating not having a good parking option and I felt a little disappointed about our Halloween plans needing to change because of my parking situation.

I talked to a few mutual friends, and they seemed split. Some felt that asking for the driveway was reasonable, especially given the COVID-19 concerns, while others thought it might have been a bit much to expect someone to accommodate me like that.

In the end, I decided to find alternative parking and will spend Halloween at home with my family instead. I still feel a bit uncertain about whether I should have asked her in the first place. Am I the asshole for asking a friend if I could park in her driveway on Halloween due to COVID-19 concerns?","So, here's the situation. I (29F) am really close friends with my neighbor, Emma (31F). We live in a busy neighborhood that gets flooded with trick-or-treaters every Halloween. It's usually a really fun time, but this year, with COVID-19 still being a concern, things are a bit different for me.

I have a compromised immune system, and my doctor has advised me to limit my exposure as much as possible. Emma's house is two doors down from mine, and she has a driveway, while I have street parking. My problem is that with the hordes of kids and parents expected to be out and about, I'm really anxious about having to walk from my car to my house through all those people.

I asked Emma if it would be okay for me to park in her driveway for the evening. I explained my health concerns and how nervous I am about potentially exposing myself to the virus. Emma was understanding but mentioned that her own parents and brother usually come over for Halloween, and they also park in her driveway. She said she would have to check with them first before giving me an answer.

Emma's family is very tight-knit, and they have their own traditions, which I totally respect. She got back to me a day later and said it wouldn't be possible because they actually need all the parking spaces for her family members. She apologized and said if she could spare a spot, she definitely would.

Our mutual friends have mixed opinions. Some think Emma should have made an exception for me given my health concerns, while others believe it's reasonable for her to prioritize her family's needs, especially since they have their own traditions and plans for the evening.

As for the outcome, I've decided to just stay home on Halloween to avoid any unnecessary exposure. I'm a little disappointed, but I understand Emma's position. We haven't had any fallout or tension over it, and we're still as close as ever. 

So, what do you think? Am I the asshole for asking Emma to let me park in her driveway on Halloween due to my COVID-19 concerns?"
59,59,AITA for scrolling far back through my boyfriend’s messages when he allowed me to?,"While my boyfriend of 3 years was replying to someone, I noticed he was replying to a name that I was unfamiliar with.

Needless to say, the class is incredibly tough. Luckily though, I have been studying since day 1 so I am doing alright in the class. I am taking the class with a group of friends, so to help them out, I shared the personal notes that I take in class with them via a google doc, and I encouraged them to invite anyone they know. \n\nRecently, one of my friends invited a friend of theirs, let\'s call her Jess(20F), who i\'ve never really interacted with, but I have a massive crush on.

You can see who looks at or edits the doc on google docs, and most of my other friends would pop up sometimes, but I would see her icon pop up alot. I also know for a fact that she isn\'t doing well in the class, so I got a really good idea. I would put subtle mistakes in the doc so that she wouldn\'t do well in the exam, and then I can offer to tutor her.

We have a pretty good relationship, but trust has always been a bit of an issue for me. I tend to get anxious about it because of a previous relationship where I was cheated on. I’ve tried to work on my trust issues, but it’s still a struggle.

Recently, I accidentally discovered that my boyfriend’s phone was unlocked when I picked it up to check the time for myself. Curiosity got the better of me, and I found myself scrolling through some of his old messages. I know it was wrong, but it felt like I just had to see if there was anything I needed to be concerned about. 

As I was scrolling, I found some messages from a girl he used to date and a few flirty exchanges from before we got serious, which made me feel uneasy. Instead of just letting it go, I confronted him about it. He was really surprised and upset that I had looked through his phone, and he felt like I was invading his privacy. I asked him if he thought those messages were appropriate, and he assured me that they were from the past and that he was completely invested in our relationship now.

However, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that maybe he wasn’t being truthful about how he felt about that girl. I ended up pressuring him to explain himself further, questioning whether he was still in contact with her or if he had feelings for her at any point. He got frustrated, saying he felt like I didn’t trust him and that this was damaging our relationship.

My friends have mixed opinions about it. Some think I was justified in my curiosity, while others believe I completely crossed a line by invading his privacy. I’m now feeling guilty for making him upset and possibly pushing him away, but I was just trying to protect myself from getting hurt again.

So, AITA for scrolling through my boyfriend’s old messages and questioning his trustworthiness?","I've been dating my boyfriend, Jake (28M), for about a year now. For the most part, our relationship has been great, but I (26F) have always had trust issues stemming from previous relationships where I was cheated on. Jake knows about my past and has been very understanding and supportive.

A few days ago, Jake left his phone on the couch while he went to take a shower. I was sitting next to it, and I could see notifications popping up from his friends. It got me curious, and before I knew it, I found myself scrolling through his old messages. I didn't have a particular reason for doing it; I just felt this overwhelming need to make sure he wasn't hiding anything.

To my surprise, I found some old conversations with his ex, which were fairly harmless but included a few flirty comments from when they were still dating. These messages were from over two years ago, well before we even met. But they made me feel uneasy because the way he flirted with her seemed so natural and effortless.

When Jake came out of the shower, I confronted him about the messages. He was confused at first and then got pretty upset, asking why I was going through his phone without his permission. He explained that those messages were ancient and that he hasn't spoken to his ex since they broke up. He reminded me that he's always been open with me and has never given me any reason to doubt him.

My friends are split on this. Some think I had a right to know my boyfriend's past and that his reaction was overblown. Others say I violated his privacy and that my actions scream insecurity and lack of trust. Jake has been distant since the incident, and it's clear that I've hurt him.

I understand that going through his phone was a betrayal of trust, but I also feel like I need reassurance sometimes because of my past. Am I the asshole for scrolling through my boyfriend's old messages and questioning his trustworthiness?"

AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Cutting Off Mom and Friend Because She's Dating a 30-Year-Old Trans Woman?'""}]","I’m a 25-year-old guy and I’ve always had a pretty close relationship with my mom. Up until recently, I thought our bond was pretty solid. I also have a close-knit group of friends, and we’ve always been open about discussing our thoughts and feelings on various topics. Recently, my mom started dating someone new, which I was initially excited about for her. 

However, I was shocked when I found out that her new partner is a 30-year-old trans woman. I’m not against trans people—don’t get me wrong—but I was taken aback by the age difference and the fact that my mom had never dated anyone who was not cisgender. I expressed my concerns to my mom about this new relationship, mainly around the age gap and the lifestyle differences that I imagined might be there. My mom brushed off my concerns, saying she was happy and that was what mattered.

I started talking to my friends about it, and to my surprise, many of them echoed my worries. We discussed how it might be difficult for my mom to navigate this new relationship, given the differences in experiences. I felt justified in my concerns and thought I was just looking out for her. But then my mom found out that I was discussing her relationship with my friends and felt betrayed. She felt like I was gossiping about her life choices instead of supporting her.

Things escalated. I stood firm in my belief that I shouldn’t have to accept her dating someone so much younger—someone I felt was potentially taking advantage of her. My mom expressed her disappointment, saying I should be supportive of her happiness. In frustration, I ended up cutting her off for a while, thinking it would send a message about how I felt, and that maybe she would reconsider her relationship.

Now it’s been a few weeks, and I feel awful. My mom is heartbroken, and our conversations have turned tense, even around family gatherings. My friends have mixed opinions, some think I was justified while others have gently nudged me to reconsider my stance. 

I’ve started to realize that my actions may have been overly harsh, and that maybe I should have approached the situation differently. So, AITA for cutting off my mom and her friend because she's dating a 30-year-old trans woman?","I (23F) have a close-knit group of friends, and among them is my best friend, Sarah (24F). Sarah and I have been friends since high school, and we share almost everything with each other. Recently, something happened that caused a rift between us, and I'm struggling to figure out if I'm in the wrong here.

A few weeks ago, Sarah introduced us to her new girlfriend, Jess (30F). Jess is a trans woman, and while I have no issue with her gender identity, I was taken aback by the age difference. Sarah has always been a bit of a free spirit, and I worried that Jess might be taking advantage of her.

I tried to express my concerns to Sarah privately, but she shut me down, saying that she was happy and that Jess treats her well. Still, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something off about their relationship, mainly because of the age gap.

Things came to a head when we were all hanging out at a mutual friend's house. Jess made a comment about how she and Sarah were thinking about moving in together, and I kind of lost it. I voiced my concerns in front of everyone, saying that Sarah was too young to be making such a big decision with someone so much older and that Jess might be manipulating her.

Sarah was furious and stormed out with Jess. Later, she texted me saying that she couldn't believe I would embarrass her like that and question her ability to make her own choices. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for her, but she wouldn't hear it.

Since then, I've cut off contact with both Sarah and Jess. I told Sarah that I couldn't be friends with her if she insisted on dating someone so much older who might be manipulating her. Our mutual friends are split on the issue. Some think I'm right to be concerned, while others believe I overstepped and should apologize.

My mom got wind of the situation and told me I was being judgmental and unfair, especially since I hadn't even given Jess a proper chance. She said that I was the one being unreasonable and that Sarah deserves my support, not my judgment.

Now, I'm left questioning if I'm really the asshole here. I genuinely thought I was looking out for my friend, but maybe I went about it the wrong way.

So, AITA for cutting off my mom and friend because she's dating a 30-year-old trans woman?"
61,61,AITA for refusing to consider people who were not wearing costumes for a costume party?,"My organization on campus always hosts a huge Halloween party. I have been every year since I was a freshman and given that I am a senior this year it was my opportunity to help plan it.  I was asked to handle the costume contest. I was the head judge.

In past years, I have never particularly liked how the costumes were judged. The male costumes were always good, but the female costumes were just not great. They went with the typical girl Halloween costume. We always had some girls that show up in real costumes and not just string and a prop. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn’t be winning the costume contest.  So the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.  We looked at each contestant and we’re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.

I'm in a bit of a predicament and could use some unbiased opinions. I recently hosted a Halloween party, and it was a blast! Everyone came dressed in fantastic costumes, and we ended the night with a costume contest. The prize was a gift card to a popular local restaurant, which everyone was excited about.

Now, here’s where things took a turn. There was one costume that really stood out to me: my friend Lisa came dressed as a historical figure, and she put a ton of effort into it. However, my other friend Mark, who often wins these things, dressed as a classic monster, and everybody else seemed to love it. When it came time to announce the winner, I felt pressured by the crowd to pick Mark, even though I personally thought Lisa deserved it more. 

In a moment of weakness, I announced Mark as the winner, and everyone cheered, but I could see Lisa's face fall. After the party, Lisa confronted me, and I confessed that I’d picked Mark to appease the crowd rather than being honest about who I thought truly deserved it. This upset her even more, and she said I’d hurt her feelings and damaged our friendship. 

Now, some friends are on Lisa's side, saying I should have just stuck to my principles and been honest about who I thought won. Others are saying I did what I felt was best for the group dynamic at the time. I did apologize to Lisa and offered to have a rerun of the contest where she could be the winner, but she declined, saying that it wouldn't change how she felt.

So here I am, wondering if I really messed up or if I was just trying to keep the peace. AITA for lying about the costume contest winner and hurting relationships in the process?","Hey all,

I'm writing here because I need some perspective on a situation that has gotten way out of hand. Recently, I hosted a Halloween party at my place and decided to have a costume contest with a pretty nice prize – a $100 gift card to a fancy restaurant. I invited all my friends and some colleagues. Everything was going great until it came time to announce the costume contest winner.

One of my close friends, Sarah, came dressed as an incredible Maleficent. Her costume was detailed and obviously took a lot of time and effort. Meanwhile, my colleague, Dave, who I don't know that well but have been trying to get in good with for work reasons, came dressed as a generic vampire. His costume was okay, but definitely not as impressive as Sarah's.

As the party was winding down, I got nervous that Dave might feel left out and that it could negatively affect our work relationship. I know, it's stupid. So, when it came time to announce the winner, I said that Dave had won. The room went silent for a moment before some polite claps followed. Sarah looked crushed, and some of my friends gave me looks of disbelief. I handed Dave the gift card, and he seemed happy enough, but the mood of the party shifted immediately.

The next day, Sarah confronted me, asking why I lied about the winner. She felt humiliated and said that it was obvious to everyone that her costume was the best. We had a big argument, and now she's barely speaking to me. Some of my other friends have also been distant and mentioned that it was unfair to Sarah.

At work, things didn't get better either. Dave got wind of the situation and, unbeknownst to me, he actually voted for Sarah as well. He returned the gift card, stating that he didn't feel right keeping it.

Now, I'm stuck in a situation where I've hurt a close friend and lost credibility among my peers. My intention was to avoid any potential awkwardness with Dave, but it seems like I've only made things worse.

So, was I the asshole for lying about the costume contest winner and hurting my relationships?"

My husband and I went out to a local diner last weekend for a quick dinner. The place was pretty busy, and we were both a little stressed after a long week of work and taking care of our two kids. 

When the check came, I noticed that it was a little higher than expected. The service had been okay, but it wasn’t great. I figured a 15% tip was fair, so I left a tip of about $9 on a $60 bill. I thought this was reasonable considering how crowded it was and how our server had forgotten my drink order. My husband, however, didn't agree. He insisted that we should tip at least 20%, stating that it's important to support service workers, especially during busy times. 

I could see where he was coming from, but I felt that a smaller tip was warranted for the service we received. We started to argue about it right there at the table, which probably wasn’t ideal, but it was one of those moments where both of us were a bit heated. Eventually, I just told him to drop it, and we left the diner.

Well, we get home, and my husband is still fuming over the tip. Instead of letting it go, he decides to grab his phone and call the diner to complain about the service and how we were treated. I was stunned. It’s just a tip! I felt embarrassed and didn’t want the restaurant to think we were the type of customers who would call and complain over something so petty. 

After he finished the call, I told him that he was overreacting and it made me feel ashamed. He argued that someone needed to stand up for fair service and that I should support him in that sentiment. I wasn’t comfortable with how he handled the situation and expressed that the whole thing was just ridiculous. 

Friends who knew about the incident had mixed feelings. Some sided with me, saying that it's not worth ruining a restaurant's reputation over a $9 tip, while others thought my husband was justified in speaking out. This split made me realize that maybe we both could have handled the situation better. 

In the end, we both felt frustrated and disappointed, and while I don’t condone my husband's actions, I also know I could have been more understanding in our debate over the tip. So, AITA for blaming my husband for calling the diner over a $9 tip dispute?","My husband and I went out for dinner a couple of nights ago to this new restaurant in town that everyone was raving about. We had a great time, the food was delicious, and the service was pretty good too. Everything was going smoothly until the bill came.

We noticed that a tip of $9 had been added to our bill. We usually tip generously, but we prefer to decide the amount ourselves. My husband flagged down our server and politely asked why the tip had been included. The server explained that it was a new policy for parties of two or more.

My husband was visibly annoyed by this and asked to speak to the manager. When the manager came over and reiterated the policy, my husband got upset and demanded they remove the tip. The manager refused, explaining that it was a policy set by the restaurant and they couldn’t make exceptions.

Now, here’s where it escalates. My husband insisted that it was illegal to mandate a tip and threatened to call the police. I tried to diffuse the situation, suggesting we just pay the bill and leave, but he was adamant. He dialed 911 right there in the restaurant.

The police actually showed up, and it became a spectacle. The officers listened to both sides and eventually told us that while it might be unusual, it wasn’t a criminal matter. They suggested we either pay the bill as is or take it up with the restaurant owners later. We ended up paying the bill, including the $9 tip, and left the restaurant.

Since then, my husband has been furious, saying the restaurant was out of line. I, on the other hand, think he overreacted by involving the police over a tip. When we got home, I told him he shouldn't have called the police over something so trivial, and that it was embarrassing and unnecessary.

My friends and family are divided. Some agree with me, saying it was an overreaction, while others think the restaurant's policy was shady and my husband was right to stand up for our rights as customers.

Now, our evening out has become this big, uncomfortable issue, and it's put a strain on our relationship. I feel conflicted because I understand he was frustrated, but I still think calling the police was too much.

Am I the asshole for blaming my husband for calling the police over a $9 tip dispute?"

Although she claims she's doing this to help him, her true motives seem to be driven by her own self-interest, as she's been estranged from him due to his past actions. She visits him once to fulfill her end of the bargain, but then refuses to engage with him further, leading his wife to accuse her of being selfish and cheating her husband out of money.

We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :\n\n“i have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.”\n\nI was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)\n\nI guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me. I often mimic people’s personality and humor to fit with them, so after we had been friends for so long we were practically the same person. everyone said that, even our moms. So i thought that since my jokes were basically hers, everything was fine. So am I the asshole?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Selling My Childhood Home to My Father at a Low Price, Then Ghosting Him?'""}]","I, 25, inherited my childhood home after my mom passed away a couple of years ago. It was a tough time for me, as my mom and I were extremely close, and losing her hit me hard. She always wanted me to do well, and I knew she would want me to use the house for my own future instead of holding onto it as a relic of the past.

After doing some thinking and consulting with a financial advisor, I decided it would be best to sell the house. My dad, who had a rocky relationship with my mom and me for years, expressed interest in buying it. I knew he was having financial struggles, and I wanted to help him out, so I sold it to him at a significantly lower price than market value. I thought it would help mend our relationship, and it felt right at the time.

However, after closing the sale, I realized I made a huge mistake. My dad immediately turned around and started making changes to the house—coloring the walls, ripping out the garden my mom loved, and even adding an awful fence. It felt like he was erasing my mom’s memory from the one place that held all our family memories, and I couldn’t handle it. Every time I drove by, it made me feel sick. The place where I had cherished moments was becoming unrecognizable.

I decided to step back and ghost him. I felt like I needed to preserve my mom’s memory in the only way I could, and I didn’t want to hear his excuses about “it being his house now.” I completely cut off communication, and it’s been several months since I last spoke to him.

Friends and family have mixed opinions on my actions. Some think it was an emotional decision and understandable given the grief I was experiencing. Others, however, say I let my emotions get the better of me and that I should have communicated my feelings to my dad rather than shutting him out. They believe that ghosting him after such a significant transaction was immature and unfair, especially since I initially did it to help him.

Now I’m left wondering if I went too far—did I make a mistake by selling the house to him in the first place? And am I the asshole for ghosting him after doing so?","My parents divorced when I was 12, and I went to live with my mom while my dad stayed in our childhood home. It was a nasty split, and my relationship with my dad was strained for years. Fast forward to a couple of years ago, my mom passed away and I inherited her portion of the house, making me a joint owner with my dad.

My dad reached out wanting to buy my share, which he really couldn't afford at market value. Since I have a good job and didn't need the money immediately, I agreed to sell it to him at a significantly reduced price, thinking it would help mend some of our lingering issues and give him some peace of mind. I figured this would be a win-win; he gets to stay in the house he loves, and I get to help him out while still making a bit of money.

The transaction went smoothly, but as soon as the papers were signed, he started acting like he didn't need me in his life anymore. Suddenly, he was too busy to talk or hang out. He never said it outright, but it felt like he just used me to get the house for cheap and then discarded me. 

About a month after the sale, I decided to cut ties and ghosted him. I stopped answering his calls, unfriended him on social media, and essentially removed him from my life. Maybe it was petty, but I felt hurt and used. 

I talked about this with a few friends and family members, and they had mixed reactions. Some understood why I was upset and supported my decision to distance myself, but others thought I acted rashly and should have addressed my feelings with him directly. My sister even accused me of being money-hungry, saying that my dad probably felt guilty for taking the house at a reduced price and that's why he pulled away.

Now, it's been about six months since I last spoke to him, and I'm starting to question my actions. Maybe I should have handled it differently, but at the time, it felt like the only way to protect myself from further emotional hurt.

Was I the asshole for selling him the house at a low price and then ghosting him?"

Me and my friends all go to the same college, and we're all in a group chat together.

While we all have our inside jokes, we’ve definitely crossed the line a few times, laughing about things that, in hindsight, weren’t appropriate. I never really thought about the implications of our jokes because it felt like harmless fun among friends.

Recently, a friend named ""Jake"" took it upon himself to report our group chat for being racist. He claimed that some of the jokes we made were harmful and perpetuated negative stereotypes. I won’t lie; I was furious when I found out. I felt betrayed that he would go behind our backs and report us instead of just speaking up in the group chat. To me, it felt like a huge overreaction, and I saw it as Jake trying to portray us as bad people when we were just joking. 

When I confronted Jake about it, I lost my temper. I told him he was being overly sensitive and that he was ruining our group dynamic. I made it clear that I didn’t appreciate him taking things too far and that we should be able to joke freely without someone policing us. The conversation escalated, and I ended up saying some hurtful things that I really regret. The other friends in our group were caught in the middle, and while some supported Jake, others felt I was right to be upset.

Jake ultimately decided to step away from the group chat, and now there’s this awkward tension hanging over our friend group. I’ve talked to a couple of friends since then, and they’ve told me that I was out of line for losing my temper and not being more mindful of our jokes. They believe that Jake had a point in feeling that our humor could be harmful.

I recognize that my reaction was harsh, and while I still think reporting was an extreme step, I’m beginning to wonder if I might be the asshole for how I handled the situation. Am I the asshole for losing my temper at a friend who reported our group chat for being racist?","I’m part of a group chat with some buddies from college. We’ve been friends for years, and the chat is usually full of jokes, memes, and general banter. Recently, a new friend, ""Alex,"" joined the group. Alex is a bit more serious and doesn’t always get our sense of humor, but we thought he was a good fit since he’s generally a nice guy.

Last week, someone shared a meme that was, in retrospect, pretty offensive. Most of us laughed it off, but Alex immediately called it out for being racist. Some of the guys brushed him off and told him to lighten up, but Alex wasn’t having it. 

A day later, we received notifications that the group chat had been reported for racist content, and some of us got temp bans from the messaging app. We quickly realized it was Alex who had reported us. Frankly, I was livid. I felt betrayed that Alex would take it upon himself to report us instead of just talking it out. We could’ve deleted the message or even kicked out the person who posted it if it was such a big deal.

I exploded on Alex in the new group chat we made (without him, of course). I accused him of jeopardizing our years-long friendship over a joke and overreacting. I said some pretty harsh things, including that if he couldn’t handle our humor, he should’ve just left instead of snitching to the app moderators.

Alex tried to defend himself, saying that the meme was hurtful and that he didn’t feel safe in a space where such content was being shared. He claimed he reported it because he felt like his concerns were being ignored and that it was less about the joke itself and more about the culture of the chat.

Now, some of my friends think I went too far and should apologize, while others are on my side, feeling like Alex overstepped boundaries. I’m confused and frustrated. Was I the asshole for losing my temper at Alex for reporting our group chat?"

Needless to say, the class is incredibly tough. Luckily though, I have been studying since day 1 so I am doing alright in the class.

A couple of years back, I was in the process of buying my first home, and I was feeling both excited and nervous. I hired a retired appraiser, let's call him Mr. Johnson, to help me with some evaluations before making my final decisions. I figured his experience would provide me with valuable insights about the housing market and the specific properties I was interested in.

During one of our meetings, I mentioned some of my concerns about the prices of houses in the neighborhood I was looking at. Instead of offering constructive criticism or reassurance, Mr. Johnson made a comment that caught me completely off guard. He said, “Well, maybe you should aim for something more in your ‘price range’ instead of shooting for the stars.” It felt dismissive and condescending, and honestly, it stuck with me. 

After the meeting, I felt embarrassed and demoralized. I ended up buying a different house than I initially wanted and always wondered if I let his comment influence my decision more than I realized.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, I was discussing my home-buying journey with a friend, and the topic of Mr. Johnson's comment resurfaced. I realized that I didn’t want to let it fester any longer and decided to reach out to him via email. I wanted to express how his comment made me feel and how it impacted my confidence during a significant life decision. I figured it might provide him some insight into how his words can affect others, even if he didn’t mean it that way.

When I reached out, I thought I was being mature and addressing my feelings, but I was met with a response that was less than favorable. He seemed irritated that I would bring up something from two years ago and said that it was unprofessional of me to reach out like that. My friends, on hearing about my effort, told me I was a bit of an AH for bringing up something long past and stirring the pot.

I genuinely believed it was important to address the hurt that comment caused me, but now I’m wondering if I overstepped. AITA for reaching out to Mr. Johnson about a hurtful comment he made two years ago?","I (36F) recently reached out to a retired appraiser, Mr. Thompson (68M), who assessed the value of my late grandmother’s estate two years ago. When I first met Mr. Thompson, the appraisal process was professional yet emotionally charged for me, as I was deeply attached to many of the items being appraised. My grandmother and I were extremely close, and her passing had left a significant void in my life.

During the appraisal, Mr. Thompson made an offhand remark about one of my grandmother's jewelry pieces, stating, ""This isn't worth much. Probably just sentimental value."" At the time, I was already sensitive and grieving, and his comment felt like a dagger to my heart. I didn’t say anything in the moment, but his words stuck with me, festering over time.

Fast forward two years, and I’m still wrestling with the hurt from that comment. I recently managed to track down Mr. Thompson’s contact information. I felt that I couldn’t move on without addressing how his remark had affected me, so I called him and asked if he remembered the appraisal. To my surprise, he did.

I explained how deeply his comment had hurt me and how, despite knowing he probably didn’t mean anything by it, I couldn’t shake off the feeling of my grandmother’s legacy being diminished. Mr. Thompson sounded quite taken aback and apologized, but not without mentioning that it had been a long while and he had since retired, implying he was surprised I was still holding onto this.

My family is split on this issue. My sister thinks it was unnecessary to bring up something from so long ago, especially to someone who is now retired and likely trying to enjoy his peace. My mother, however, understands why I felt the need to address it but also feels that it’s time to let go and move on.

Since the call, I’ve been feeling conflicted. Did I do the right thing by confronting Mr. Thompson even after two years, or should I have just let bygones be bygones and moved on without reopening old wounds, especially on someone who’s likely moved past his working life?

So, AITA for reaching out to a retired appraiser two years later to discuss a hurtful comment?"

We've been through thick and thin together, so when he started dating Sarah (27F), I was genuinely happy for him. They seemed great together, and honestly, I thought it wouldn’t change anything between us. But boy, was I wrong.

As Mark’s relationship with Sarah grew serious, I noticed a shift. He started to spend more time with her and less with me. At first, I understood. New relationships can be all-consuming, and I respected that. I gave him space, but deep down, I felt a bit neglected. I didn't want to be that friend who threw a tantrum over something I knew was natural, but it still hurt.

Fast forward a few months, and things took a turn. Mark and Sarah broke up. I felt a rush of mixed emotions. I was sad for him, of course, but part of me also thought, ""Yes! He’ll come back to me now!"" I was ready to provide the support he needed, like I always had.

However, when he got back on his feet, Mark didn’t immediately seek me out. Instead, he started hanging out with a new circle of friends he’d met through Sarah. I couldn’t help but feel a little betrayed. I had been there for him before, during, and after his relationship, and now he was just moving on without me.

So, I confronted him. I told him how I felt abandoned and expressed that I expected him to want to catch up and reconnect after everything. I knew it might sound selfish, but I believed our friendship was strong enough to handle a bit of honesty.

Mark was polite but taken aback. He said he needed time to figure his life out after the breakup and that he appreciated the friendship but couldn’t just drop everything to cater to my feelings. He mentioned that just because he wasn’t reaching out didn’t mean he didn’t care about me.

Our conversation left me feeling even more frustrated, and honestly, I didn’t understand why he couldn’t just want me back in his life like before. Now there's an awkward tension hanging over our friendship, and I can't shake the feeling that I may have pushed him away further.

I talked to a couple of mutual friends about the situation, and while some sided with me, others argued that I was being a bit unreasonable, as he has the right to prioritize his healing and new friendships.

About six months ago, Jake started dating ""Emily"" (F26). She’s sweet, kind, and honestly, perfect for him. They seem really happy together, and I should be happy for him, right? But instead, I’ve been feeling increasingly jealous and resentful. 

Jake and I used to spend almost all our free time together, but now, understandably, he spends most of it with Emily. We still hang out, but it’s different. The spontaneity is gone, and everything needs to be scheduled. He no longer tells me things first; Emily does. This has left me feeling like I'm losing my best friend.

Last weekend, we were at a mutual friend’s party. I had a bit too much to drink and ended up confessing to Jake that I’ve always had feelings for him. I said I didn’t understand how he could just move on and forget about me. He was understandably shocked and said that he’s happy with Emily and that I need to respect that. The rest of the night was awkward, to say the least.

Since that night, Jake has been distant. He hasn’t been returning my texts as quickly, and when we do talk, it’s very surface-level. Emily found out about my drunken confession and is understandably upset. She thinks I was trying to sabotage their relationship, and now Jake is in the middle, torn between his best friend and his girlfriend.

My other friends think I overstepped and that I shouldn’t have said anything. They believe I need to move on and let Jake be happy. But I can’t help feeling like I’ve been sidelined. I miss the closeness we once shared and feel like I’m losing a part of myself.

I get that he’s in a relationship and boundaries change, but I can’t help feeling hurt. Am I the asshole for expecting my best friend to still want me in his life the way he used to, even though he’s moved on and is happy with someone else?"

I had a Spotify account, but due to some financial issues, I had to cancel my subscription for a while. My best friend, ""Jake,"" offered to let me use his account during that time, and I was super grateful. We’ve always shared music and made playlists for each other, so it felt kind of natural.

Fast forward a few months, I finally got my financial situation sorted out and was able to re-subscribe to Spotify. I was really excited to have my own account again, and I spent a couple of hours customizing it and creating new playlists. When I logged in, I noticed that Jake’s playlists and some of his favorites were still kind of mixed in my library since I had been using his account for so long.

I shot Jake a text, jokingly saying that I wasn’t going to bother creating my own playlists because his were just too good. He responded with a laughing emoji and said I should definitely make my own because that’s the whole point of having my own account. I didn’t think much of it until I started sharing my playlists and music recommendations with him, but I felt like he wasn’t taking my suggestions seriously.

One day, I sent him a playlist I had curated specifically for a road trip we planned for the weekend. Instead of engaging with it, he brushed it off and said he’d just stick to his favorites. Feeling a bit hurt, I snapped and said something along the lines of, “Well, now that I have my own account, I guess you won’t be missing my taste in music anymore.” It was meant to be light-hearted, but I could tell it came across as rude. 

Jake didn’t take it well and said I was being a jerk after everything he did for me. I realized that my comment probably stung considering I had relied on him for so long. Our mutual friends overheard this exchange and pretty much agreed that I was out of line for my comment. They think I should have recognized how generous he was and appreciated his support instead of throwing it back in his face.

Now, I feel bad because I genuinely care about Jake and our friendship, but I also thought I was just joking. Am I the asshole here for being dismissive and a jerk to my best friend?","I've been dealing with a real headache lately involving my Spotify account. For a bit of context, my best friend ""Mark"" and I have shared pretty much everything since high school—games, accounts, you name it. We've always been super close, almost like brothers. 

Recently, my Spotify account got hacked, and I lost access to it for about two weeks. My playlists, saved songs, everything was gone, and I was pretty frustrated about it. I contacted Spotify support, and after some back-and-forth, they finally managed to get my account back. 

When I logged in, I noticed that some of my playlists had been messed with, songs were added and deleted, and the account name had been changed to something stupid. I was really pissed off and immediately assumed it had to be someone who got the info from my circle, given how secure I thought I'd kept it.

I vented to Mark about it, saying something like, ""This is why I hate sharing accounts or letting anyone know my login info. People just mess things up."" Mark got quiet and didn't say much, which was unusual for him. Later that night, I got a message from him saying he was the one who had accessed my account. He said he had noticed the hack and tried to fix things but then got busy and forgot to tell me he had made some changes. Apparently, he thought he was helping but didn’t want to admit it because he felt bad when things got messed up.

I lost my temper and sent him a series of harsh messages, calling him irresponsible and saying he should’ve just left it alone instead of making it worse. Mark apologized multiple times, but I was still too angry to let it go. I even told him that maybe we should stop sharing anything to avoid this kind of problem in the future.

Our mutual friends found out about the incident and told me I was being a massive jerk. They said that Mark was trying to help and that I overreacted. Mark has been distant since then, and our friendship feels strained now. 

I realize I may have overreacted, but I felt so violated and upset in the moment. Now I'm wondering if I took it too far and if I should have handled it differently. So, am I the asshole for being a jerk to my best friend after I got my Spotify account back?"

Recently, we hired a babysitter, Sarah, to watch him while my husband and I went out for a date night. We had gotten good recommendations, and I was really hopeful it would go smoothly.

Everything was going fine until I got a text from Sarah while we were out. She said that my son had accidentally spilled milk all over her. She handled it well and even sent me a photo of him looking apologetic, which I thought was cute. But then, she told me she was going to take a shower to clean up.

When we got home about an hour later, I walked in to find Sarah still in the shower, and my son was in the living room just watching TV. At first, I was relieved to find that he wasn’t upset or hurt, but then I felt really uncomfortable that Sarah was showering instead of keeping an eye on him. I mean, he’s three! He could easily get into something or hurt himself. 

I knocked on the bathroom door and asked how much longer she would be. When she replied she needed a few more minutes to rinse off, I lost my temper and yelled at her, saying it was irresponsible to leave my child unsupervised like that. I told her that it was unprofessional and that she should have waited until after she made sure he was settled and safe. 

She came out looking a bit shaken and apologized, but she also defended herself by saying that the spill was a lot and she wanted to clean herself up since it was all over her clothes. We ended the night with a weird vibe, and I could tell she was upset when she left. 

Now I’m feeling conflicted. Was I right to expect her to prioritize my son’s safety over cleaning herself up? Or did I overreact and make her feel bad for something that was an accident? My friends are divided on the matter, with some saying I was justified because my child's safety comes first, while others think I was harsh and should have been more understanding.

Like many parents, I rely on babysitters occasionally to help out when I need to work late or run errands. Last week, I had an important meeting that ran late, so I hired a new babysitter, Claire (19F), who came highly recommended by a friend.

When I came home, I found Max playing in the living room, but I couldn’t find Claire. I asked Max where she was, and he told me she was in the bathroom. I knocked on the door and she told me she was taking a quick shower because Max had accidentally spilled milk all over her. She said she didn't want to sit in soggy clothes for the rest of the time.

I was immediately frustrated. I didn't understand why she couldn't just change into spare clothes or deal with it until I got home. I yelled at her, saying it was unprofessional to leave a child unattended, even for a short time, to take a shower in someone else's house without permission. Claire apologized, saying she made sure Max was in a safe place with his toys and could hear him the whole time. But I was still upset and told her I wouldn't be needing her services anymore.

I discussed it with my friends and family, and they've been split. Some think I overreacted, saying a quick shower in an emergency isn’t a big deal and that she was thinking of her comfort and hygiene. Others agree with me, saying it was inappropriate and she should have handled the situation differently.

Since then, I've been feeling conflicted, especially after seeing how well Max got along with Claire. She was really good with him, and now I'm wondering if I was too harsh. But at the same time, I feel like she should have put Max’s supervision first. 

So, am I the asshole for yelling at the babysitter for taking a shower after my kid accidentally spilled milk on her?"

He was always supportive and we spent a lot of time together, but he also had very clear expectations about responsibility and accountability. Recently, though, things took a turn.

Last month, I was home from college and decided to have a few friends over. We got a little rowdy, indulged in some drinks, and at some point, someone suggested a game of indoor frisbee. It was a terrible idea, but being in the moment and not thinking straight, I agreed. You can probably guess what happened next: the frisbee went flying and crashed into one of the support beams in my dad's garage. It created a noticeable dent and some damage to the structure. 

The next morning, I was horrified when my dad walked in and saw the damage. He was understandably furious. We ended up having a long talk about responsibility, and he made it clear that it was my fault and that I needed to own up to my actions. I felt awful, but honestly, I also thought about how my dad's garage has been a little old and needed some repairs anyway. 

So, here's where I might be the asshole: when my dad mentioned fixing the garage, I suggested that since I caused the damage, I shouldn't have to pay for it—he should just cover the costs, since it's his garage and it's been needing work for a while. I honestly thought he would agree that it makes sense for him to pay for it, but he exploded, saying that I need to take responsibility for my actions and that unless I want to pay for the repairs, I’d better step up.

I talked to a few friends about it, and they were divided. Some said I should definitely help pay for the repairs since I was the one who caused the damage, while others thought my dad was being unreasonable. 

Now I'm left wondering if I'm really the asshole for expecting my dad to just cover the costs after I messed up?","I (22m) recently moved back in with my dad (50m) after finishing college. My dad has a really nice garage that he keeps impeccably clean and organized. He uses it not only for parking his car but also as a workshop for his woodworking hobby. All of his tools are neatly stored, and he takes a lot of pride in that space.

Last week, while I was attempting to back my car out of the garage, I misjudged the distance and ended up scraping the side of his car and knocking over a shelf with some of his tools. The damage to his car and the garage itself was pretty significant—there were scratches and dents on the car, the shelf was broken, and a few of his expensive tools were damaged.

When my dad saw what happened, he was understandably upset but didn't get angry. He calmly asked me what happened and then said we’d talk about it later. I assumed since it was an accident and because he’s my dad, he’d take care of fixing everything. I figured he had insurance that would cover it, and as I’m currently job hunting, I don’t have much money to spare.

However, when we sat down to talk, he told me I needed to pay for the damages. He wasn't asking for the whole amount upfront but wanted me to set up a payment plan to cover the costs over time. I was taken aback and honestly a bit hurt. I argued that since it was his garage and I’m his son, he should cover the damage. I felt he should be more understanding given my financial situation.

He said he understood it was an accident but emphasized that taking responsibility for my actions was important. My dad has always been big on teaching life lessons, but this felt harsh to me, especially since I’m trying to get on my feet after college.

I mentioned this situation to a few friends, and their reactions were mixed. Some agreed with me, thinking parents should help their kids out unconditionally, while others sided with my dad, saying it’s a good lesson in responsibility.

Now there's a noticeable tension between us, and I’m wondering if I might be the asshole here. Shouldn’t my dad, as a parent, be more lenient and financially supportive, especially since it wasn’t intentional? Am I the asshole for expecting my dad to pay for the damage I caused to his garage?"

Overall, we get along really well, and have similar lifestyles and interests. However, there's one issue that's been causing tension between us lately: my snoring.

I’ve always snored, but it never seemed to be a major problem until my partner moved in with me. He’s mentioned it a few times, saying it disrupts his sleep and makes it difficult for him to fall asleep at night. I get that, but I also feel like it’s just part of who I am. I’ve tried to brush it off as something he needs to adjust to. He even suggested I see a doctor, but I’m not keen on going through tests or treatments for something I see as normal.

Last week, I went to bed after having a long day, feeling exhausted. My partner came in a bit later, and as usual, when I fell asleep, I started snoring. Upon waking up the next morning, he was annoyed and said he barely slept. He brought it up again, asking me to consider using nasal strips or trying to change my sleeping position. I replied that I find it ridiculous that I have to change my behavior for something I can't really control. I mean, people snore, right?

This led to a bigger argument where he accused me of not caring about his sleep and well-being. I felt defensive and told him that he needs to find a solution if it really bothers him—like using earplugs or sleeping in another room. It escalated from there, and I ended up saying a few hurtful things about how he’s being dramatic over something that is a common issue for many people.

Now, our relationship feels a bit strained. He thinks I’m not taking his concerns seriously, and I think he’s overreacting. Friends have mixed opinions; some say I should be more considerate, while others believe he should adjust to my quirks in a relationship. It’s left me second-guessing whether I’m the one being insensitive.

So, AITA for refusing to acknowledge my snoring as a problem for my partner's sleep?","I (26F) have been with my partner (28M), Alex, for three years, and we've lived together for the past year. Things have generally been great between us, except for one recurring issue: my snoring. According to Alex, I snore so loudly that it wakes him up multiple times a night. He says it's affecting his sleep and, as a result, his mood and overall well-being.

At first, I thought it was just an occasional thing, maybe due to a cold or being overly tired. But Alex insists it's a nightly occurrence. He started off by gently nudging me to turn on my side, which worked temporarily. However, it didn’t take long for the snoring to resume, and Alex would be left irritated and sleep-deprived. 

A couple of months ago, Alex began suggesting various remedies: nasal strips, special pillows, and even a visit to a sleep specialist. I brushed off most of his suggestions, figuring it was just an overreaction. To be honest, I found it hard to believe that my snoring could be causing such a big issue. After all, I was sleeping just fine.

Matters came to a head last week when Alex, exhausted and frustrated, asked if we could sleep in separate beds. I took it as an exaggeration—his way of guilt-tripping me into taking his complaints more seriously. We had a heated argument where I accused him of making a mountain out of a molehill. He retaliated by saying I was being inconsiderate and dismissive of his needs. In my defense, I argued that he was blowing the situation way out of proportion. 

Our friends are divided on this issue. Some think Alex is justified in his complaints and believe I should at least give his suggestions a try. Others feel he's making too much of a fuss and that snoring is a common issue couples deal with. My family thinks Alex should just get used to it and maybe invest in earplugs.

Since then, Alex has been visibly more stressed and our relationship feels strained. We’re now in this awkward limbo where neither of us wants to budge. I realize my reaction hasn’t been the most accommodating, but I also feel like Alex is being overly dramatic.

Given the tension it’s caused, am I the asshole for refusing to acknowledge my snoring as a problem for my partner's sleep?"

I’ve always wanted a pet, and when I saw this sweet little tabby at the shelter, I couldn’t resist bringing him home. The only problem? One of my roommates, Lisa (F25), is extremely uncomfortable around cats. When I first moved in with Lisa and our other roommate, Dave (M27), I had mentioned wanting a pet. Lisa was clear then that she had a bad experience with cats as a child and would rather not have one in the house at all. I understood her concerns and assured her I wouldn’t get a cat if it bothered her.

However, after living together for a few months and getting to know Dave, who is a huge cat lover, I felt more confident that we could manage the situation. Dave was all for the idea and even offered to help me train and care for the cat. I thought maybe having the cat around could help Lisa overcome her discomfort, as she often says she would like to like them. 

So, I brought the cat home without any further discussion with Lisa. At first, she was taken aback and made it clear she was unhappy about the situation. I tried to reassure her that I would keep the cat in my room, use a litter box that would be cleaned regularly, and minimize any interactions between them. I thought that allowing Lisa to see that my cat was well-behaved would ease her discomfort over time.

However, it escalated quickly. Lisa became visibly anxious, and one night, I found her up late, apparently crying in the living room because of the cat. I felt bad, and I tried to talk it out with her, but she just told me it was disrespectful of me to get a pet without considering her feelings. Dave echoed her sentiments, saying that while he loves the cat, it’s important to respect our roommate's boundaries.

In the days since, Lisa has been distant and has even started spending more time at her friend’s place to avoid being around the cat. I can see that my decision really affected the atmosphere in our shared home. I thought I could bring a little joy into my life, but now I’m left wondering if I should’ve considered Lisa’s comfort more seriously before deciding to adopt the pet.

So, AITA for bringing a cat into our shared house despite one roommate's explicit discomfort?","So, a couple of months ago, I (F24) moved into a shared house with three other roommates: Jake (M26), Sarah (F25), and Emma (F23). We all got along pretty well, and things were generally smooth. Recently, though, I adopted a cat named Whiskers. I've always loved cats and finally felt ready to have one of my own. When I first mentioned the idea of getting a cat, almost everyone seemed okay with it – except Emma.

Emma told me she had a serious discomfort around cats. She didn't go into specifics, but she was firm about not wanting one in the house. I thought about it for a while and figured Emma would eventually get used to Whiskers. I mean, lots of people say they don't like cats until they actually live with one, right?

So, one day, while Emma was out, I brought Whiskers home. Jake and Sarah were both there and seemed excited about the new addition. When Emma got home and saw the cat, she looked visibly uncomfortable and went straight to her room. Later that evening, she confronted me, saying she thought I was being incredibly selfish, especially after she had been clear about her feelings.

Jake and Sarah are trying to stay out of it, but they did tell me privately that they think Emma is overreacting. They said the house should be a comfortable place for everyone, and Whiskers isn't hurting anyone. I tried to justify it to Emma by saying that Whiskers brings me a lot of joy and that it would benefit the household overall – you know, for stress relief and companionship.

Things have been tense ever since. Emma avoids common areas and barely speaks to me. Every time I try to engage her in a conversation about Whiskers, she shuts it down or leaves the room. It’s starting to affect the overall vibe in the house.

Did I overstep by bringing Whiskers in despite Emma's discomfort? Am I the asshole for not taking her feelings into account?"

We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts.

She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said.

She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)\n\nI guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me.

We chose a beautiful beach destination and were looking forward to spending quality time together. We were excited and had a packed itinerary with all sorts of fun activities. However, things took a turn when we arrived at the hotel.

On our first morning there, I woke up a little later than him and he decided to head to a nearby coffee shop because he was craving a special coffee that he had heard about. At first, I was okay with it—after all, everyone has their own morning routines. But when I got myself ready and texted him to meet up, he told me he was already at the coffee shop and was planning to stay there a while longer to enjoy his drink and some pastries. 

I thought, “Okay, just a quick pit stop,” but then I waited...and waited. Hours passed, and he never returned. I was starting to feel abandoned, especially since we had planned to spend our mornings together. Instead of enjoying the beach, I felt anxious and frustrated that he was off alone while I was left behind. So, I decided to go to the coffee shop to find him. 

When I got there, I saw him sitting outside with a few other tourists, chatting and laughing. I felt a wave of emotion hit me. I confronted him right there, saying how he had totally ditched me. I couldn’t hold back my feelings, and I ended up freaking out at him about how inconsiderate it was to leave me there alone, especially on a vacation we planned together. I felt like he was prioritizing his coffee over our time together.

After that, he seemed taken aback and apologized but also said I was overreacting. Later, he told me that I should have been more understanding since he just wanted to grab coffee and enjoy the moment. He tried to explain that it wasn't a big deal to him, but to me, it felt like a huge deal. 

My friends have mixed opinions. Some say I was justified because vacations are about spending time together, while others think I should have let him enjoy his time. He and I have had a few heated discussions since then about how we communicate and what we expect from each other on vacation.

Now, I can’t help but question myself. Was I the asshole for freaking out over what may seem like a small thing?","My boyfriend (M 27) and I (F 26) recently went on our first big vacation together. We were both really excited because it was our first trip abroad, and we had meticulously planned every single day. Both of us are big planners, and we had a full itinerary to make the most out of our trip.

On the third day of our vacation, we had a scheduled early morning tour. We had to be at the meeting point by 7:00 AM, and we stayed up late the night before because we got lost while wandering around the city. I struggle with mornings, and while my boyfriend is an early riser, I need a bit more time to wake up and get ready.

That morning, my alarm didn’t go off, and he woke me up around 6:30 AM because I was still asleep. I rushed to get dressed and barely had time to brush my teeth before we had to leave. Seeing how rushed and groggy I was, he suggested that he go out to get us some coffee from a nearby café while I finished getting ready. I agreed, thinking it would be a nice gesture and a great way to wake up fully.

After he left, I hurried to finish up, but when I was finally ready and waiting for him, he was nowhere to be found. I started to get anxious as time was ticking, and I called him multiple times with no answer. By 6:55 AM, I was freaking out. I decided to go to the café he had mentioned, but by the time I got there, he wasn’t there either. I was panicking and frustrated because our tour was about to start. 

Finally, at 7:10 AM, he showed up with two cups of coffee in hand, looking completely relaxed. I was livid. I started yelling at him in the middle of the street about how irresponsible he was for leaving me behind and not answering his phone. He tried to explain that the café had a long line, and he lost track of time, but I was too angry to listen. My outburst caused a scene, and I stormed off back to our hotel, skipping the tour altogether.

Later, he told me he felt I overreacted and made a big deal out of nothing, and that it wasn't fair to ruin the day over a cup of coffee. Our friends back home are divided. Some say I was justified in being upset since we had plans, while others think I was too harsh and should have been more understanding.

Looking back, maybe I overreacted, but I felt completely abandoned and stressed out in a foreign city. So, AITA for freaking out when my boyfriend left me behind for coffee on vacation?"

We’ve built a great relationship, but I have to admit, I struggle with some of her habits that feel a bit inconsiderate to me. A few months ago, we moved in together, and that's when these issues started to arise more frequently.

One major thing that has bothered me is Sarah's penchant for keeping the thermostat set at a chilly 65 degrees Fahrenheit. I’ve always been someone who feels more comfortable in a warmer environment—around 72 degrees is my sweet spot. I’ve tried to explain this to her multiple times, but she insists that she prefers the cooler air and doesn’t see the need to adjust it for my comfort. I understand that she’s paying part of the bills too, but I feel like in a partnership, we should be able to accommodate each other's needs.

Recently, I told her that I felt she should prioritize my comfort over her preferences, especially since I often find myself wrapped in layers just to feel somewhat comfortable at home. Sarah got really upset, saying that she shouldn’t have to change her lifestyle just because I’m uncomfortable. I tried to emphasize that a bit of compromise could really go a long way in our relationship, but she said it felt unfair to her that I was asking her to change for me.

Now, our friends have weighed in, and they mostly side with her, saying that feelings of comfort and home should be a two-way street and that imposing my comfort over hers is unreasonable. I’ve been reflecting, and part of me feels like I might be selfish for wanting her to bend to my way of comfort rather than working towards a solution together.

I can’t help but think maybe I’m wrong in expecting her to place my comfort above her own. So, AITA for expecting my partner to prioritize my comforts over her own?","My partner, Sarah (29F), and I (31M) have been living together for about two years now. Our relationship has generally been smooth, though we've had our occasional disagreements like any couple. One recent issue, however, has sparked a bit more conflict than usual.

Sarah has always been particular about her living environment. She likes to keep the apartment cool, around 68°F (20°C), which she finds comfortable. I, on the other hand, prefer a warmer setting, around 75°F (24°C). Whenever Sarah is out or busy, I usually adjust the thermostat to my liking. But when she's home, she quickly changes it back, claiming she can't focus or relax if it's too warm.

A few nights ago, we had a pretty heated argument about it. I was working from home and wanted the temperature set to 75°F. Sarah was in the other room, and when she came out, she noticed the change and immediately turned it back down. This led to a back-and-forth exchange of thermostat adjustments, and ultimately, both of us were frustrated.

I argued that I should be comfortable in my own home, especially since I was working and needed to concentrate. I told her that my comfort should be prioritized since I spend more time at home due to my job. Sarah countered saying that her comfort is just as important, especially since she suffers from migraines and the cooler temperature helps prevent them.

Our friends are divided. Some think I have a point and deserve to be comfortable, especially given I work from home. Others side with Sarah, saying that migraines and her physical discomfort should take precedence over my preference for warmth.

Now, our thermostat has become a symbol of our conflict, and the tension between us has slightly grown. We're both stubborn and neither of us wants to back down, but deep down, I wonder if I'm being unreasonable.

So, AITA for expecting my partner to prioritize my comforts over her own and wanting to keep the apartment warmer when I'm working?"

Recently, though, I had an incident that really tested my patience.

I was handling a project and had a conference call with one of my employees, who has a reputation for being dismissive of women in the workplace. During the call, he made some offhand comments about how ""a woman wouldn't understand"" the technical aspects we were discussing. I tried to brush it off initially and redirected the conversation back to the project, but he just doubled down with more condescending remarks.

I felt my blood boiling, especially since this wasn’t the first time he’d acted like this. After several attempts to maintain my composure, I finally lost my temper. I told him that it was 2023 and that his attitude was unacceptable. I called him out directly and used some strong profanity, which I absolutely regret but felt was the only way to show how serious and frustrated I was.

After the call, I had a few colleagues reach out. Some were supportive, saying they admired me for standing up to him. Others, however, said I crossed a line by using profanity and that it reflected poorly on my leadership skills. They argued that while his comments were inappropriate, losing my temper made me look unprofessional.

Since then, the employee has filed a complaint against me, and HR is involved. I feel justified in my response but also realize that maybe I could have handled it differently—perhaps with more tact or by escalating the situation without getting personal.

So, am I the asshole for losing my temper and using profanity during the call? I genuinely thought I was standing up for myself and for a more respectful workplace. ","I (F34) manage a small team at a tech company. It’s a great job generally, but there's one employee, John (M28), who has been a thorn in my side. John is talented but has a noticeable issue with respecting female authority. This isn't just my opinion; several of my female colleagues have experienced his dismissiveness as well.

Last week, we were having a video conference to discuss an important project. Given the complexity, I needed everyone's full attention and cooperation. Mid-meeting, John started talking over me and dismissing my points. This isn't new behavior for him, but it was especially bad this time. When I called him out, he smirked and said, ""Maybe if you understood the tech side better, you wouldn't have these issues.""

At that point, I saw red. I snapped back, telling him that his sexist attitude was unacceptable and that he needed to get his act together. As the argument escalated, I lost my temper and used some profanity. Specifically, I said, “Stop being a condescending asshole and listen for once.” The meeting ended abruptly, and I immediately regretted my choice of words, although not the sentiment behind them.

After the meeting, I received mixed feedback. Some of my coworkers, especially the women, appreciated that I stood up to John. Others thought I crossed a line by losing my cool and using profanity, arguing that as a manager, I should maintain professionalism, even when provoked.

HR got involved when John filed a complaint about the hostile work environment. Now, I’m under scrutiny for my reaction, and John is getting off with a slap on the wrist for his behavior.

Relations in the team are strained. Some respect me more for standing my ground, while others seem wary of my temper. I know I should’ve handled it better, but I was fed up with his blatant disrespect.

So, AITA for losing my temper and using profanity during a call with a sexist employee?"

I learned that the hard way. She didn\'t want to do family holidays and just wanted to be alone with her husband, stopped doing family vacations. Honestly I thought it was just because she doesn\'t like me, but she loves her son in law and isn\'t any more interested in their children.  I will admit this hurt me and I set pretty harsh boundaries. One of the boundaries was that my husband could not accept gifts from MIL. She would always get him really nice birthday and Christmas gifts and get our kids cheap impersonal junk. MIL\'s gifts to him were always experiences or hobby related things as he grew up wealthy but does not make the kind of money he grew up with, and she feels he doesn\'t treat himself enough. Six years ago we told MIL that he would no longer be accepting these gifts as he is a husband and father first, and it isn\'t right.  Well my husband has been struggling with some depression lately. One of his biggest things is he feels like he is just a husband and father and lost his identity. He feels he gives constantly and gets very little back. I hate seeing him like this, so I called MIL and asked if she wanted to resume giving him gifts and said I would no longer stand in the way.  Well he had a birthday recently and MIL bought him something for his hobby (probably a $10,000-12,000 bike according to the internet) and gave him some gift cards so he could take a weekend away to his favorite trails. I could see how much it meant to him and felt I made the right decision, but my daughter blew up.  She said I was being unfair to her by allowing MIL to flaunt how selfish she is, and that he should stand strong and say there will be no gifts until she can buy gifts for the family. She said she was disappointed in my lack of a backbone and disappointed in her dad. I saw my husband\'s face fall and told him it was ok and I didn\'t regret my choice, but our daughter was cold the rest of the night. The last gift MIL gave her was a tiny makeup pallet she probably picked up in line.

My husband’s birthday is coming up, and his mother, my mother-in-law, has decided to buy him a very expensive bike—think top-of-the-line, several thousand dollars kind of bike. While I can appreciate the gesture, I can’t shake off the feeling that it's overshadowing an important milestone for our daughter, who is also celebrating her birthday just a week before his. 

My husband is quite passionate about biking, and I know he’s been eyeing this bike for a while. But here’s the kicker: it feels like my mother-in-law's gift is making our daughter feel overlooked. She’s been looking forward to her birthday party and had planned a fun celebration with her friends. However, when she found out about the bike, she expressed to me that she feels like she’s not special anymore and that her birthday will be ignored because of the focus on her father’s big gift. 

I’ve tried talking to my mother-in-law about it, suggesting that maybe it would be nice for her to do something a little less extravagant for my husband this year, especially since we want our daughter to feel valued and appreciated on her special day. But my mother-in-law dismissed my concerns, saying it’s just a bike and it's what he wants. She also seemed to suggest that I might be overreacting. 

Now, I’m feeling caught in the middle. I don’t want to come off as controlling or jealous of my husband’s gift, especially since it will mean a lot to him. But I also can’t ignore how our daughter is feeling and the importance of her birthday. My friends have mixed opinions—some say I should just let it go and let my husband have his moment, while others agree that I should maintain the focus on our daughter's celebration.

So, AITA for allowing my mother-in-law to go ahead with buying my husband this expensive bike, knowing it’s making our daughter feel less special? Or am I being too sensitive about the whole situation?","Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and need some perspective. My husband and I have a seven-year-old daughter, Lily. Recently, my mother-in-law bought my husband an extremely expensive bike worth several thousand dollars. This was something he had been eyeing for a long time and had mentioned in passing a few times. My mother-in-law is quite well-off, and she loves to spoil her family.

The problem arose when Lily saw her dad's new bike and realized how expensive and special it was. She got very upset and told us she feels like she's not special because she never gets anything as nice. I tried explaining to her that it was a gift from grandma and that adults sometimes get different kinds of presents. It didn't seem to help much, and now she's been moping around, clearly feeling left out.

My husband thinks that our daughter will get over it and that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. He argues that the bike was something he really wanted and it was an opportunity that he couldn't say no to. My mother-in-law also feels that she was just trying to do something nice for her son and doesn't see the issue.

However, some of my friends have suggested that it was insensitive to allow such a lavish gift knowing it might upset Lily. They've hinted that it sends a message that her feelings are less important. Now, I'm feeling torn. On one hand, I don't want to seem ungrateful or to dictate what my mother-in-law can buy. On the other hand, I hate seeing my daughter so upset.

Did I make a mistake in letting my mother-in-law buy the bike without considering Lily's feelings more carefully? Am I the asshole for allowing this to happen and making our daughter feel like she's not special?

Thanks for any advice."

I’ve held two officer positions, created & managed a very successful social media account for the union, led the planning for our recent picket, got us tons of news/media coverage, & served on our bargaining team. I became friends with a nurse who decided to serve on our bargaining team this year. She has been a nurse in our union for almost 20 years, but this was her official first involvement with the union.

As in, she will do the best job) most of all.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Firing the Dog Sitter for Sleeping in My Bed?'""}]","I have a pretty tight-knit family, and we all love our pets. When I needed a dog sitter for a weekend trip, I called my sister, who has a good rapport with my dog and had watched him before. She's always been great with him, and I trusted her to take care of my fur baby while I was gone.

Before I left, I made it clear that my dog is not allowed on the furniture—especially my bed. I even have a specific set of rules for sitter duties to keep things consistent for my pup and to respect my space. I thought everything was set.

However, when I got back from my trip, I was met with an unexpected surprise. My sister casually mentioned that she had let my dog sleep in my bed with her every night I was gone. I was taken aback! Not only did I feel that she disregarded my explicit instructions, but I was also upset that she had crossed a boundary that I’ve set. It’s my home, and I don’t want to deal with pet hair or the potential misbehavior that could come from allowing him on the bed, especially when he’s not used to it.

When I confronted her about it, she brushed it off, saying, “It’s just a dog, what’s the big deal?” I explained that it was a big deal to me and that I felt disrespected, leading to some heated discussions between us. I ultimately decided to end our dog-sitting arrangement and told her I would look for someone else in the future since she clearly couldn’t respect my wishes.

My family has mixed opinions. Some agree with me, believing that as the pet owner, I have the right to set boundaries. Others think I overreacted and that it was just a harmless situation. I can’t help but feel guilty for firing my sister over what some see as a minor infraction.

So, AITA for firing my sister as my dog sitter for letting my dog sleep in my bed?","I recently hired a dog sitter to take care of my two dogs while I was away on a business trip for a week. She came highly recommended and had great reviews, so I felt confident leaving my beloved pets in her care. I gave her clear instructions about the dogs’ routines, feeding schedules, and where she could sleep—specifically mentioning the guest room.

When I returned home, everything seemed fine at first; the dogs were happy and healthy, the house was clean, and she had left a detailed note about how the week had gone. However, later that night, when I went to bed, I noticed something odd. The bedding was different from how I had left it. I found a strand of her hair on my pillow and realized that she had been sleeping in my bed. This made me uncomfortable, as I have a fairly personal connection with my sleeping space and had explicitly told her to use the guest room.

Feeling a bit grossed out and invaded, I contacted her and asked if she had slept in my bed. She admitted she had, explaining that she had trouble sleeping on the guest bed because of her bad back and that she didn’t think it would be a big deal. I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with her decision and that I no longer needed her services in the future.

I mentioned this to a few friends, expecting them to back me up, but opinions were mixed. Some agreed with me, saying it was a breach of trust and boundaries, while others thought I overreacted, arguing that she was simply trying to get a good night's sleep and that it didn’t cause any real harm.

Now, the dog sitter left me a message expressing how hurt she was by my decision, saying it was difficult to find work and that she felt her actions didn't warrant being fired. 

I’m conflicted because I value my personal space but also don't want to be unfair or overly harsh, especially since she did take good care of the dogs. 

So, am I the asshole for firing the dog sitter for sleeping in my bed?

However, things took a turn recently after a family gathering where she made some really hurtful comments about my career choices and life decisions. It felt like she was belittling everything I’ve worked hard for, and I tried to express how her words had impacted me. Instead of acknowledging my feelings, she brushed it off and made jokes, which didn’t sit well with me at all.

As my birthday approached, I found myself feeling conflicted about how to celebrate. My mom offered to take me out for dinner, which I appreciated, but deep down, I knew I wanted something more meaningful—an acknowledgment of our recent tension. I hoped for a heartfelt apology, a real conversation about what happened, but all I got was a half-hearted message saying, “I’m sorry if you were offended.” That didn’t feel genuine to me.

So, I decided to treat myself to a birthday gift that I had been eyeing for a while. It’s something that symbolizes my journey and accomplishments—something I felt I deserved after everything. I bought it on the actual day of my birthday and shared a photo of it on social media. My friends were supportive and celebrated with me, but when my mom saw the post, she was upset. She felt like I was being childish for buying myself a gift instead of accepting her “apology” and enjoying what she had to offer.

My friends are split on the situation. Some think I have every right to treat myself, especially after how I felt during our last interaction. Others believe I should have accepted her gesture and not made it so public. I’ve tried to explain my feelings to her, but she’s still hurt and thinks I’m being difficult.

Now, I’m left wondering if I overreacted. AITA for buying myself a birthday gift because my mom's apology just wasn’t enough for me?","So, here's some backstory. I'm a 24-year-old woman, and my mom and I have had a rocky relationship for as long as I can remember. She tends to forget important dates and milestones in my life, including my birthday. This has been a sore point for me, but I've tried to let it go over the years. However, this year I decided to do something different.

My birthday was last week, and as expected, my mom didn't acknowledge it until late in the day. When she did remember, she sent me a brief text that basically said, ""Happy birthday, sorry for forgetting again."" There was nothing heartfelt about it, no call, no effort to make it up to me. I was disappointed but not entirely surprised.

Feeling a bit down, I decided to treat myself. I bought a moderately priced necklace I'd been eyeing for months. It wasn't a huge splurge, just something to make myself feel special and loved. When I posted a photo of it on social media, my mom saw it and called me, upset. She said it made her look bad, and that it was ""disrespectful"" to buy myself a birthday gift when she had apologized.

I tried to explain to her that her apology felt insincere and that I needed to do something for myself. I wasn’t trying to make her look bad; I was just trying to make myself feel good. My friends are divided—some say I'm justified in treating myself, while others think I should have accepted my mom's apology regardless of how it made me feel.

The fallout has been awkward. My mom and I aren't on speaking terms right now, and I can't help but feel guilty for causing a fuss, even if it was unintentional. I didn't want to escalate things, but here we are. 

So, am I the asshole for buying myself a birthday gift because my mom's ""apology"" didn't feel good enough?"

We’ve always had a pretty good relationship as roommates, splitting bills and chores, and I thought we were on the same page about living arrangements.

Recently, Jake dropped a bombshell on me: he’s planning to move out in a couple of months and wants to raise the rent for the remaining time we’ll be living together. The rent is already pretty steep, and I have been struggling to make ends meet since my job hours got cut back. Now, suddenly, he’s telling me he wants to increase it by 25% because he feels he needs to “maximize his investment” and “there’s a lot of demand for this place.”

I felt completely blindsided. I admit I lashed out at him. I told him it was incredibly selfish to raise the rent when he was planning to leave me high and dry and that he clearly didn’t care about the arrangement we had. I might’ve said some nasty things about his priorities and how he could be more considerate of my situation. Jake looked shocked and really hurt by my reaction, and we ended up arguing for a while before he left to stay with a friend.

After cooling down, I felt pretty bad about how I handled it. I realized I could have approached the situation differently instead of immediately getting defensive and angry. Jake’s decision to move out is ultimately his choice, but the way I reacted to the rent increase was definitely over the top.

Our parents have been somewhat split on this. My mom thinks I was justified because I had a right to be upset about the rent raise, especially since I’m in a tough spot financially. My dad, on the other hand, says I should’ve kept my cool and handled it more maturely since he is still my brother, and family should support each other.

Now there’s tension between us, and I’m worried about how we’ll handle the living situation going forward. So, AITA for lashing out at my brother when he told me he’s raising the rent and moving out?","My brother, Jack (28M), and I (25F) have been sharing an apartment for the past three years. Our arrangement had always worked well: we split the rent and utilities equally, and chores were divided. Living together allowed us to save money, and we enjoyed each other's company. 

A few weeks ago, Jack told me he was planning to move out. He's been dating someone seriously, and they decided to take the next step and get a place together. While I was happy for him, the news caught me off guard. The rent for our apartment is already on the higher side, and with him leaving, I'd be responsible for the whole amount unless I found a new roommate fast.

Jack then mentioned that he would be raising my share of the rent for the final month he stays here to cover some additional costs he incurred while looking for a new place and to help him with the transition. He gave me about a month's notice but said that the next payment would be nearly double what I usually pay. I felt blindsided and overwhelmed by this sudden financial burden.

I couldn't help myself; I lashed out at him, accusing him of being selfish and inconsiderate. I told him it was unfair to expect me to cover his costs and that he should have planned better. We ended up having a heated argument, and he left the apartment for a few days to cool off. 

Our family and friends have mixed opinions. Some think Jack should have been more considerate of my situation, while others believe I overreacted and should support him during his transition. Jack and I haven't spoken much since the argument, and the tension is palpable.

I'm starting to realize that maybe my reaction was too harsh. While Jack's request was unexpected and stressful for me, I understand he's also going through a significant life change. Perhaps I could have approached the situation more calmly and tried to negotiate a more manageable solution.

Am I the asshole for lashing out at my brother when he told me he's raising the rent and moving out?"

Fake names.\n\nI (37 F) decided a couple months ago with my husband (40 M) that it was time to get our kids a dog because they were old enough to care for one. My kids are Rose (8 F) and Isabella (10 F). My husband had a boxer as a kid and said that he has fond memories with that kind of dog so we decided to get one and surprise the kids. He is now five months old. I\'m sure many of you will understand that because he is a puppy he needs a lot of exercise because he is very high energy. We often take him on walks at the park near our house because it has several very long walking paths.\n\nWell, this past weekend there was an event going on at the lower half of the park, so it was closed off so all we had left was the top half. It was just me and my daughter Rose because my husband had to pick up Isabella from a friend\'s house. While at the park my daughter kept begging me to hold Coopers leash. After a while I gave in. While Rose was walking him another dog came by and Cooper got excited and started running over which pulled my daughter who let go of the leash. Cooper ran over to the other dog trying to play and all of a sudden I heard screaming at me to ""get my dog"". My daughter ran over and started crying while the girl (2oish F?) held her dog down with her arm in his mouth and screamed at me to stop standing there. The man with her started yelling at me to stop my dog who was jumping with excitement. After the shock wore off, I rushed over and removed my dog checking Cooper and Rose. The man with her started yelling at me that I was being irresponsible by letting the dog walk free in a leash required area and that people like them take their rescues there for training and I probably just destroyed months work of progress with their dog. I explained he was being held but my daughter dropped by accident and that he needed to stop yelling as it was scaring my kid. He started yelling that if my daughter wasn\'t strong enough to hold the dog she shouldn\'t be walking it or take it to a unleashed area to practice. When we got home Rose was still crying. When my husband asked what happened and I told him, he was angry at me telling me that I need to be more responsible and that I was at fault. I told my mother about it and she told me that dogs like the girls shouldn\'t be allowed to go to parks and I agree.

We're all close in age, and growing up, we always supported each other through various challenges. However, our family dynamic has become more complicated as we've gotten older.

Recently, Jake and Tom have both gotten themselves into financial trouble. Jake lost his job due to layoffs, and Tom racked up some debt from a failed business venture. They approached me for help, and while I want to support them, I told them I could only do so much. I’m not in a position to lend them thousands of dollars since I have my own savings goals.

That's when I thought about Emily. She recently received a sizable inheritance from our grandparents, and she’s been living comfortably without any major financial worries. I reached out to her, asking if she could consider helping our brothers with a small loan or even a financial gift. I stressed that it would really mean a lot to our family and that it could help Jake get back on his feet while giving Tom a chance to restructure his finances.

Emily hesitated and said she was hesitant to risk her money on their poor decisions, which I can understand to some extent, but she’s always been someone who advocates for family support. I pushed her a bit more, saying things like, ""You have the means to help, and it would really make a difference,"" and that she should consider the potential consequences if we let them struggle alone.

Things escalated when Emily finally told me that I was putting her in a difficult position and that she didn't appreciate feeling pressured. She accused me of trying to manipulate her into making a decision she was uncomfortable with. I got frustrated and told her that family is supposed to help each other in tough times.

Now, our conversations are strained, and she hasn't spoken to me much since. I feel bad that I pushed her, but I also think that I was just trying to do what’s best for our family and give the boys a fighting chance. I might have gone too far with my pressure on her, but I genuinely want to support my brothers without putting myself in a financially risky situation.

So, AITA for pressuring my sister to risk her money to help our brothers?","I (32F) have three siblings: my older sister, Lisa (35F), and my two younger brothers, Jake (30M) and Ryan (28M). Growing up, Lisa was always the responsible one. She worked extra jobs in high school and saved meticulously, while Jake and Ryan were more laid-back and kind of lived in the moment. Now, Lisa has a steady job, a great house, and a healthy savings account, whereas my brothers have struggled financially.

Recently, Jake's business started failing due to various reasons, including the economic downturn, and Ryan lost his job. Both of them came to me asking for help. I'm not in a position to offer financial aid myself since my husband and I are still paying off our mortgage and have two kids to support. Desperate to help my brothers, I turned to Lisa. I suggested she could help them out financially since she's in a better position.

Lisa was hesitant. She said she's worked hard for her savings and has her own financial goals and future to consider, especially since she’s planning to buy a second property for investment. I tried to reason with her, saying that family should support each other, especially in hard times, and that our brothers are in dire straits. I even went as far as reminding her of how Jake helped her move into her first apartment and how Ryan always babysat her kids for free when they were little.

Lisa stood firm, saying she's willing to help in other ways, like offering career advice or helping them find job opportunities, but she didn’t want to risk her money, especially without any guarantee of getting it back. I got frustrated and told her she was being selfish and not considering the gravity of our brothers' situations. I said that sometimes, family needs to make sacrifices for each other, just like our parents did for us.

This led to a big argument, and Lisa hasn’t spoken to me much since. My brothers are upset too, feeling betrayed by her reluctance to help them out of their current predicaments. Meanwhile, some mutual friends think I’m overstepping by pressuring Lisa to give up her hard-earned savings, while others believe family should come first and Lisa should be more willing to help.

Now, our family dinners are filled with tension, and the strain on our relationships is palpable. I’m starting to wonder if I crossed a line. Did I go too far by pressuring Lisa to risk her financial stability to help our brothers?

AITA for trying to pressure my sister into risking her money for our brothers?"

My relationship with my mother-in-law (MIL, F55) has always been a bit rocky; she can be passive-aggressive, and I often feel like she undermines my parenting choices. Recently, she started dating someone new (M45) who I’ll refer to as “Dave.” Initially, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, wanting to support my MIL’s happiness.

However, I quickly realized that something about Dave didn't sit right with me. He often made inappropriate comments about my kids, like how he used to love playing rough with his friend's kids and how he thought my son would love that too. He also seemed overly touchy, insisting on hugging my daughter even when she looked uncomfortable. I brought my concerns up to my husband, and he shared them with his mom. Her response was to dismiss my feelings and defend Dave, insisting I was overreacting.

After a particularly unsettling incident where Dave joked about how my kids would “get used to him” and that “kids need to toughen up,” I decided I had to confront him. I told Dave that his comments were inappropriate and made me uncomfortable, especially regarding my kids. Instead of taking it seriously, he laughed it off and said I was being a “typical overprotective mom.”

When my MIL found out about our confrontation, she blew up at me. She accused me of trying to push her boyfriend away and ruining her happiness. I stood my ground, explaining that my kids’ safety and comfort come first, and I couldn’t just sit back and let this slide. This has now caused a massive rift between me and my MIL. She’s refused to speak to me since and has been telling family members that I am trying to control her life.

Guess what? Now I feel guilt creeping in. I know my intentions were to protect my kids, but losing my MIL's approval feels heavy. My husband is supportive of my decision, but he also fears that this could alienate his mom even further.

So, AITA for confronting my MIL's boyfriend about my concerns, even though it meant losing her approval?","So, here's some backstory. My MIL (57) started dating this guy, Mark (60), about a year ago. At first, he seemed nice enough, a bit rough around the edges, but who isn't? Over time, though, I've noticed some things that really concerned me. He drinks a lot, and when he does, he gets really loud and aggressive. He's never been physical with anyone in the family, but his temper is seriously alarming. We have two kids, 6 and 8, and their safety is my top priority.

One night, during a family gathering at our house, Mark got hammered. He started ranting about politics and got super confrontational with my wife (32). He was yelling, and our kids were terrified. I tried to diffuse the situation, but he just got angrier. Eventually, I had enough and told him to leave our house. MIL was upset and tried to calm him down, but he wasn't having it. I told him that his behavior was unacceptable and that he was not welcome in our home until he could control his drinking and temper.

MIL was furious with me. She said I was overreacting and that Mark was just going through a rough patch. She accused me of trying to control her life and told me that if I couldn't accept Mark, I was risking her relationship with her grandkids. I was shocked. My wife was torn, as she didn't want to upset her mother but also didn't want Mark around our kids if he was going to act like that.

Since then, there's been a lot of tension. MIL hasn't visited as much, and when she does, she insists Mark comes too. I've stuck to my guns, telling her that Mark is not welcome in our home until he gets help for his drinking. My wife is caught in the middle, and it's causing strain on our marriage. Some of our friends think I did the right thing, but others believe I should have handled it differently to avoid alienating MIL.

So, AITA for confronting MIL's boyfriend and potentially losing her approval? I feel like I needed to protect my family, but maybe there's a better way I could have handled it."

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I’m the asshole I get it.

Mia has always been a bit of a free spirit and tends to have her own way of doing things. Her father and I divorced when she was pretty young, and since then, her dad has been more of a ""fun parent,"" often indulging her whims and showering her with gifts. 

Last week, Mia came home from a visit at her dad's with a brand new phone. At first, I thought it was just another one of those temporary gadgets, but then she handed it to me while also excitedly explaining how her dad had bought it for her. She’s been asking for a phone for ages, and I’ve been holding off, thinking she’s not quite ready for that responsibility yet. I mean, she still struggles with chores and keeping her room clean!

After I took a look at the phone and all the apps along with the unlimited internet her dad had set up, I felt uneasy. I didn't think she was mature enough to handle the responsibility that comes with such a device and certainly not the unrestricted access to the internet. I had been planning to wait until she was at least in middle school before allowing her to have one. So, I decided to take it away and told Mia that we would discuss it when her dad and I had a chance to talk. 

Mia was understandably upset. She cried and yelled, saying it was unfair and that her dad could just buy her one any time he wanted. I tried explaining my perspective, but she wasn’t having it. I reached out to her dad, and he was furious with me for undermining his decision. He suggested that I was trying to control everything and not letting Mia enjoy the things she wanted. 

Now, both Mia and her dad aren't speaking to me, and I feel like a total villain. My friends say I did the right thing as a parent, wanting to keep her safe and teach her about responsibility, but I can’t shake the feeling that I overstepped. Maybe I should have just let her keep the phone, even though I think it isn't right for her. 

So, am I the asshole for taking away my daughter’s new phone after her dad bought it for her?","I (36F) have been divorced from my ex-husband (38M) for about five years now. We co-parent our 11-year-old daughter, Emma, who splits her time between our houses. My ex and I have had our ups and downs, but I believe we generally do our best to make things work for Emma's sake.

Last weekend when Emma returned from her dad's house, she excitedly showed me her brand-new iPhone. Apparently, her dad had bought it for her as a surprise gift. Emma was over the moon, and I could see how much it meant to her. 

Here's where the problem arises. I have always been very cautious about how much screen time Emma gets, especially on devices like smartphones. A few months ago, we actually had a discussion about when Emma should be allowed a phone, and I expressed that I didn't think she was ready yet. My ex seemed to agree at the time, but I guess he changed his mind without consulting me.

I was worried about how the phone would affect Emma's focus on school, her sleep schedule, and even her social interactions. I also felt blindsided by my ex making such a big decision without even giving me a heads-up. So, after Emma went to bed, I took the phone away and explained to her the next morning that she wouldn't be keeping it. I told her it wasn't a punishment, but rather a delay until she was more mature and we could establish some ground rules together.

Emma was understandably upset and said that her dad gave it to her as a gift and she should be allowed to keep it. She even accused me of being unfair and ruining her excitement. When I spoke to my ex about it, he was furious. He said that I overstepped and ruined a special moment he wanted to share with his daughter. He argued that he had every right to give her the phone, especially since it was his own money.

Even some of my friends think I might have overreacted and should have simply set boundaries around the phone's usage instead of taking it away altogether. They believe I'm being too controlling and that I should have had a more cooperative approach with my ex.

I still think I was justified. We are co-parents, and such a big decision should have been made together. But now I'm questioning if I handled the situation poorly. 

So, AITA for taking away my 11-year-old's new phone after her dad bought it for her?"

Jake has a son, Tyler (8M), from a previous relationship. Tyler is a great kid, and I really love spending time with him. However, I recently went through a tough time; I lost my mom a few months ago, and the grief has been pretty overwhelming.

As Tyler's birthday approached, Jake and I talked about how to celebrate. Jake wanted to make it a big day for Tyler, which I totally understood. He planned a party with tons of friends, a magician, and all the usual birthday fun. I was excited for Tyler, but the thought of a big celebration just made me feel heavy with my own grief. 

The day of the party came, and I really tried to put my feelings aside for Tyler. I helped set up decorations and baked a cake, but when the party started and I saw all of Tyler's friends running around, I felt incredibly out of place. I watched Jake bonding with Tyler and engaging in all the fun, while I couldn't shake the sadness I was feeling from my loss. 

Eventually, during the party, I stepped outside for a bit to collect my thoughts. I felt like I was intruding on a happy moment that I just couldn't fully be a part of. I didn’t want to bring anyone down, so I kept it to myself and returned to the party. But throughout the day, I just felt more and more like a ghost in the background.

Later, after the party, Jake noticed I seemed down and asked if I was okay. I ended up sharing my feelings about feeling left out and how hard it was for me to be in such a joyful environment when I was still grieving. Jake was really understanding and said he never meant for me to feel that way. He mentioned he just wanted to make Tyler's day special. 

Some friends of mine said I should have been more vocal about my feelings beforehand, but I didn’t want to ruin Tyler’s day or bring my grief into the celebration. I just couldn’t handle it without feeling guilty. 

In the end, I don’t want to be a burden in this relationship or to Tyler, but I also don’t want to feel invisible.

He wanted it to be special and memorable for his son, which is something I completely understand and appreciate.

However, my own family has been going through a really tough time. My grandmother, who I was extremely close to, passed away just a week before the birthday celebration. I've been dealing with a lot of grief and sadness, and honestly, I was feeling pretty low. My boyfriend knew about my grandma’s passing and has been supportive in his own way.

When the birthday party was being planned, my boyfriend asked if I wanted to be involved, but I felt like I was being more of a burden in my current state. The day of the celebration, I decided to join them for a bit, attempting to be there despite my grief. But it turned out to be much harder than I anticipated. Surrounded by laughter and joy while I was still mourning made me feel out of place, and I ended up leaving early to avoid breaking down in front of everyone.

Afterwards, my boyfriend tried to console me, acknowledging how hard it must have been for me. He felt bad that I couldn’t fully participate and enjoy the day. Meanwhile, his son didn’t really notice my absence much, as he was having a great time with his friends and family.

My boyfriend’s ex-wife also reached out, thanking me for coming even for a short while and expressed her condolences, which was really kind of her.

So, I (29F) have been married to my husband, Jake (30M), for about three years now. Recently, we decided to open our relationship up, and it’s been going pretty well for us. We have established boundaries and are both happy with the arrangement. However, I’ve been grappling with something that’s been bothering me lately.

We have a mutual friend, Sam (31M), who’s been really supportive of our relationship, but he has no idea that we’re in an open marriage. I’ve noticed that Sam often engages in conversations with Jake about relationships, love, and even marriage, and he often refers to Jake and me as “the perfect couple.” This is where I start to feel a bit uneasy.

I think it’s important for Sam to know about our open relationship because it shapes how we navigate our lives, and I feel like it’s a piece of information that could help him understand our situation better. Jake, however, is more hesitant. He thinks that it’s not really Sam’s business, and he doesn’t want to complicate things or make Sam uncomfortable. They’ve been friends for years, and he doesn’t want to jeopardize that friendship.

I’ve tried to explain my perspective to Jake, saying that if Sam is going to discuss relationships with us and is under the impression that we are traditional, it feels a bit deceptive. I believe it's vital to be honest with our friends about significant aspects of our lives, especially when it directly affects how we interact.

After our discussions, Jake still feels strongly about not disclosing our relationship status, and I can see that he’s torn between my feelings and his comfort level. Sam has been nothing but understanding and supportive of us, and I don’t think he would judge us harshly, but Jake disagrees and feels it could change how Sam sees our relationship.

So now I’m left wondering if I’m being unreasonable for wanting Jake to share this part of our lives with Sam, or if Jake is justified in wanting to keep it to ourselves. Am I the asshole for thinking my husband should have this conversation with our friend?","My husband (34M) and I (32F) have been married for five years and in an open relationship for the past two. We've always been very transparent with each other and anyone we get involved with about our arrangement.

There’s this woman, let's call her Sara (30F), who recently joined our friend group. She’s smart, funny, and has quickly become a good friend to both of us. My husband and Sara have been hanging out a lot lately, and it's clear she has developed a crush on him. I'm perfectly okay with this, and so is my husband. Given our open relationship, stuff like this isn't a big deal as long as everyone is honest and respectful.

The problem is, Sara has no idea that we're in an open relationship. She knows we're married, but my husband hasn't told her about our arrangement. I feel like this is important information for her to know before things potentially go any further between them. I don’t think it’s fair for her to develop deeper feelings for him without knowing the full context of our marriage. 

I brought this up to my husband, and he gets where I’m coming from, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to bring it up unless things actually start to get serious between him and Sara. He feels like it might complicate things needlessly, and he doesn’t want to scare her off or make her think we're weird. He’s also worried it may cause drama in our friend group.

Our friends who know about our open relationship have mixed opinions. Some think like me and believe honesty is the best policy right from the start, while others side with my husband and think it’s not a big deal unless it becomes serious.

Right now, Sara is still in the dark about the true nature of our marriage. My husband and I haven’t had major conflicts over this, but I’m still uneasy about the whole thing. Am I the asshole for thinking my husband should tell Sara about our open relationship sooner rather than later?"

About six months ago, Sara started having difficulties with her mental health. I completely understand that mental health struggles can be incredibly tough, and I’ve been there to lend a listening ear and support her as best I can. 

However, things started to change when she began to withdraw from our friend group and consistently cancel plans at the last minute. We would plan outings, and she’d either ghost us or come up with an excuse that felt flimsy. It’s not that I don’t sympathize; I know how hard it must be for her. But it began to feel like she was using her struggles as an excuse to opt out of responsibilities, and it was frustrating me and our other friends.

A few weeks ago, during dinner with a couple of mutual friends, I brought up Sara's behavior. I expressed my concern and how it felt like a burden to keep adjusting our plans around her last-minute cancellations. I thought we could brainstorm ways to support her better, but instead, the conversation turned into gossip. We started sharing our frustrations and doubts about whether she truly wanted help or if her mental health was being used as a crutch. I knew it wasn’t right, and part of me felt guilty, but I also felt overwhelmed and wanted to vent.

Afterward, one of our friends texted Sara to check in, and during their chat, she mentioned our conversation. Sara was devastated. She reached out to me, expressing how hurt she was and feeling betrayed that I would say those things about her. I felt terrible, but I also felt like I wasn’t completely wrong to voice my feelings. Now, our friend group is kind of split: some friends think I was justified in expressing my frustrations, while others feel I should have kept my mouth shut.

Now, I’m questioning if I went too far. Did I cross a line in my judgment of Sara’s situation when all she needed was support? AITA for judging and gossiping about a friend who's struggling with mental health?","So, I (28F) have a close-knit group of friends from college. We’ve all been through a lot together, and I consider them to be like family. One of my friends, Emily (29F), has been struggling with mental health issues over the past year. She’s been seeing a therapist and has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety.

Recently, Emily has been acting more withdrawn and has been missing out on our regular hangouts. She’s been cancelling plans last minute and isn’t as responsive in our group chat as she used to be. A couple of weeks ago, she skipped one of our friend’s birthdays, which really upset the birthday girl. This led to a heated discussion between a few of us about Emily’s behavior. 

I admit, I was frustrated. We’ve all been trying to be supportive, but it feels like she’s always making excuses and not putting in any effort to maintain the friendships. During this conversation, I ended up sharing some of my concerns about her actions and even speculated a bit about her therapy sessions and the progress she might be making, or lack thereof. I said something along the lines of, “How long can we keep making excuses for her? She needs to get it together.”

Word got back to Emily about what I said. She confronted me, obviously hurt and feeling betrayed. She said that she thought she could trust me and that my comments made her feel even worse about herself. I tried to apologize and explain that I was speaking out of frustration, but she wasn’t having it. Now, the rest of the group is divided. Some think I overstepped and was too harsh, while others agree that Emily needs to step up and take responsibility for her behavior.

Emily has been even more distant since the incident. She’s barely responding to messages and hasn’t come to any gatherings. I feel guilty because I didn’t mean to hurt her. I was just venting and trying to understand what’s going on with her. But now it seems like I might have pushed her further away.

Am I the asshole for judging and gossiping about a friend who’s struggling with mental health?"

The original plan was that I would just go with her family and my dad would join me afterwards once he got work stuff sorted, but the pandemic  got in the way and made it harder for my dad to join me afterwards since I am immunocompromised and he wasn't in a position to be isolated with me.

I set the scene by dimming the lights and telling them I needed them to react as if they were scared by an ""unexpected twist."" I even had a friend record everything on my phone to capture their reactions. My dad was in on the joke initially but seemed a bit nervous, while Jake was super excited. We did a few takes, and I thought we were all just having fun.

However, things took a turn when Jake couldn’t quite get into the spirit of the prank. He started yelling, and my dad, trying to calm him down, ended up flipping out too when he thought Jake was genuinely scared. They both ended up really upset when they realized it was just a prank. My dad told me I crossed a line, and Jake was in tears, saying he thought I was serious.

After I explained it was all meant to be silly, my dad still insisted I shouldn't have done that. Now, there’s a weird tension in the house, and I feel guilty for what happened. Some friends think it was all in good fun, while others say I should’ve considered their feelings more.

So, AITA for pulling a prank on my dad and Jake after being away for a year?","I (18F) recently came back home after spending a year abroad as an exchange student. My dad (50M) remarried during that time, and his new wife has a 10-year-old son, Tom. I hadn't met them in person before returning. I was excited to come back and thought it would be fun to break the ice with a prank. I realize now that might not have been the best idea.

When I got home, I decided to do something quirky. I pretended to be a ghost, dressing in a white sheet and planning to pop out when they least expected it. My dad, his wife, and Tom had no idea I was already home since I arrived a day earlier than planned. 

As they were watching TV that evening, I jumped out from behind the couch with my ghost costume and yelled, ""Boo!"" Tom screamed and ran out of the room crying. My dad and his wife were stunned. After a few moments, my dad realized it was me and his expression turned from shock to anger.

His wife comforted Tom while my dad pulled me aside. He was furious and said that the prank was completely inappropriate and inconsiderate, especially since Tom is already having a hard time adjusting to all the changes. He went on to say that it was a childish and poor way to introduce myself to my new family. Later, Tom refused to come out of his room, and his mom was visibly upset.

I felt bad and tried to apologize, but Tom wouldn't talk to me and my dad was still mad. My friends think it was just harmless fun and that my dad is overreacting, but I can see their point too.

Since then, the atmosphere at home has been really tense. I definitely didn't mean to scare Tom that badly, and I didn't anticipate my dad and his wife being so upset. I just wanted to do something memorable and fun, but it clearly backfired.

I've been thinking about what I did and started questioning if I made a huge mistake. So, am I the asshole for pulling that prank on my dad and new brother after being away for a year?"

These events are usually filled with laughter, food, and a lot of family bonding time, which I genuinely enjoy. However, I also have a group of friends who I've been roller skating with for years now—it's a passion of mine and usually the highlight of my week.

Last weekend, we had a family reunion planned at my parents’ house. I had committed to going, of course, but when I checked with my friends, they planned a roller skating night at a local rink, and it was one of the rare occasions where all of them could make it. I was torn because both events were important to me, but the skate night was something I had been looking forward to for a while.

As the family event went on, things were fun but also starting to drag on a bit, and I couldn't shake the excitement of skating. Eventually, I made the decision to leave the family gathering early, about two hours before it was set to end, to meet up with my friends. I texted my mom as I was leaving to let her know I had to go—figured it was better than just disappearing.

When I arrived at the rink, I was ecstatic to see my friends and immediately jumped into the fun. But I did receive a text from my sister saying that my parents were upset with me for leaving early. Apparently, they expected me to stay longer and help with clean-up and just enjoy the family time together. I didn’t realize how much it would bother them, but it seems like they felt I chose my friends over family.

Now my parents are giving me a hard time about it, saying I need to prioritize family events more and that they felt hurt I didn't stay longer. My friends think it’s silly that they are upset, suggesting that I should be able to balance both without guilt.

I genuinely thought it was okay to leave early since I had already spent a good portion of the time with my family, but I can see why they might feel hurt. AITA for leaving family events early to go roller skating with friends?","I’ve always loved roller skating. It’s been my passion since I was a kid, and I never outgrew it. Recently, my friends and I formed a small roller skating club, and we meet every Friday evening. It’s the highlight of my week, and I genuinely look forward to it. 

However, my family has a tradition of having family dinners every Friday night. It’s a time when everyone gathers, catches up, and enjoys each other's company. I value these dinners, but ever since my skating club started, I’ve been leaving these events early to make it to our skating sessions on time. 

Last Friday, during our family dinner, I announced that I’d be leaving early to meet my friends. My parents were visibly upset, and my sister flat-out told me I was being selfish. She argued that family time should come first, especially since it’s only once a week and that I could skate any other time. My mom joined in and said that she misses having me around for the entirety of the dinners, and my dad just shook his head in disappointment.

I tried to explain how much roller skating means to me and how it’s a commitment I’ve made to my friends as well. But the argument turned into a pretty heated discussion. My cousin chimed in and said that it’s all about finding balance and that I’m tipping the scales too much in favor of my hobby over family.

Since then, there’s been some awkwardness. My sister is still giving me the cold shoulder, and my parents have been distant. My friends, on the other hand, think I’m not doing anything wrong and support my decision to pursue my passion. They even suggested I try to get my family to understand how important this is to me.

I’m now second-guessing my choices. I don’t want to hurt my family, but I also don’t want to give up roller skating. The tension is getting to me, and I feel stuck.

87,87,AITA for taking my daughters “emotional support” dog back to the shelter?,"My daughter is 17. I’m 47. My wife is 44. My daughter had been having problems with her anxiety and depression, school had been very hard for her and she asked us if she could get an animal for “emotional support”. I asked her why we couldn’t just put her in regular therapy again but she said she didn’t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn’t want to try it again.  I was pretty against bringing an animal into the home as my daughter can barely keep her room clean and remember to wash her dishes, much less take care of an animal. And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog because I work long hours and didn’t want to be picking up messes when I got home. My wife said I was being unfair and that this could be what my daughter needed to get back in good spirits.  So we got her a dog. We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care (such as frequent grooming and other traits) and I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference.   The dog was great at first and it got along with my daughter and wife greatly. Me not so much, but it could probably sense I didn’t really like it either. But then it started getting out of its leash on walks, tearing up the couch and various other toys we bought it. My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I’d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet.

We got Buddy about a year ago to help Emily manage her anxiety and depression, and he’s been a wonderful companion for her. However, over time, I've noticed that Emily hasn't been taking the responsibility of caring for Buddy as she should. 

At first, she was great with him—walking him, feeding him, and training him. But lately, it's become increasingly apparent that I’ve been doing most of the work. She often forgets to feed him, leaves him alone for long stretches while she’s at friends' houses, and doesn’t take him for walks unless I remind her. I’ve talked to her multiple times about the importance of caring for Buddy and discussed that having a dog comes with responsibilities. Each time, she promised to do better, but nothing has changed.

A week ago, things reached a breaking point when I came home from work to find Buddy sitting in his cage, hungry and needing a walk. Emily had gone to a friend’s house after school and hadn’t bothered to check on him or even leave food. I was really upset and confronted her about it. She got defensive and insisted that I was being too harsh and that it wasn’t a big deal. In a moment of frustration, I made the decision to take Buddy away and explained that until she could prove she was responsible enough to care for him, he would stay with my sister, who has a more stable environment. 

Emily was devastated and cried for days. She says I don’t understand how much she needs Buddy and that I’ve betrayed her trust. I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing—if she can’t take care of him, then Buddy deserves a better situation. However, I also feel guilty about how I went about it and whether I should have given her one more chance.

My friends and family are divided. Some say I was right to take Buddy away; she needs to learn responsibility. Others think I should have handled it differently, perhaps by seeking a compromise or a different way to motivate her. 

So, am I the asshole for taking away my daughter's emotional support dog due to her lack of responsibility? ","I (45M) have a 16-year-old daughter, Emily, who has been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few years. About a year ago, after discussing it with her therapist, we decided to get an emotional support dog, Charlie, to help her cope. Charlie has been a great addition to the family and has really made a positive impact on Emily's mental health.

However, there have been growing issues with Emily's responsibility when it comes to taking care of Charlie. We agreed from the start that Emily would be the primary caregiver—feeding him, walking him, and ensuring he gets the attention he needs. Over the past few months, Emily has repeatedly neglected these responsibilities. I've found myself constantly reminding her to feed Charlie or take him for walks. On numerous occasions, I've had to step in and take care of him myself to make sure he's not being neglected.

Last week was the tipping point for me. Emily had forgotten to feed Charlie for an entire day and he was clearly hungry and distressed. I sat her down and had a serious conversation about her neglect and emphasized how unfair it was to Charlie. She promised to be better, but the very next day, she forgot to take him for a walk, despite my reminders.

Feeling like I had no other choice, I decided to take Charlie away temporarily and have him stay with my sister. I explained to Emily that until she proves she can be responsible and take care of Charlie properly, he would stay with my sister. Emily was devastated and accused me of being heartless and not understanding how much she needed Charlie.

My wife thinks I might have been too harsh and that I should have given Emily more chances. On the other hand, my sister agrees with my decision, saying it's important for Emily to learn responsibility. Emily's therapist is also concerned and suggested that removing Charlie might do more harm than good for Emily's mental health.

Now, Emily is even more withdrawn and refuses to talk to me, and it's created a lot of tension in the house. I feel stuck between wanting to teach her a lesson in responsibility and not wanting to further harm her mental health.

So, AITA for taking away my daughter's emotional support dog due to her lack of responsibility?"

WIBTA?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Expecting a Friend to Pay Me Back for a Concert Ticket I Let Her Use?'""}]","A few weeks ago, I had a friend, let’s call her Sarah, who expressed interest in going to a concert with me. I had purchased an extra ticket since I wasn't sure she was going to be able to afford it. I agreed to let her use it, hoping it would be a fun night for both of us. We’ve been friends for a couple of years and have done a lot together, so I didn't mind fronting the ticket cost.

The night of the concert, Sarah had an amazing time, which I was thrilled about. However, after the concert, when I casually mentioned getting reimbursed for the ticket, she responded with disbelief. She thought I was joking and that the ticket was a gift. I assumed she would understand that letting her use the ticket meant she was going to pay me back, especially since I had already been quite accommodating.

When I pressed the issue a bit more, she got defensive and started saying things like, “You’re my friend; you shouldn't expect me to pay you back for that.” This left me feeling really frustrated. I mean, I wouldn’t ask her to pay me back if I hadn’t spent my own money upfront. Other friends chimed in, and some agreed with her perspective that friends don’t charge each other for things like that, while others sided with me, stating that it’s just common courtesy to pay back borrowed money.

Now, there’s been a bit of tension between us since that night. I genuinely care about her, but I just feel like she’s taking advantage of our friendship. I want to maintain our friendship, but I also believe I shouldn’t have to feel guilty for expecting her to reimburse me for something I paid for.

So, Reddit, AITA for expecting a friend to pay me back for a concert ticket I let her use?","Several months ago, a group of us bought tickets to see our favorite band live. It was supposed to be an amazing night, but unfortunately, one of our friends, Emily, couldn't make it last minute due to an emergency. I had already paid for her ticket up front, which cost $150. 

Rather than let the ticket go to waste, I offered it to another friend, Sarah, who hadn't been able to get one before they sold out. Sarah eagerly accepted and used the ticket to attend the concert with us. I was happy someone could use it rather than leaving an empty seat. We had a great time. 

After the concert, I casually mentioned to Sarah that I'd appreciate it if she could pay me back for the ticket since she got to enjoy the event. Sarah looked a bit taken aback and said she thought I was just giving her the ticket because Emily couldn't go. She didn't expect to pay for it, especially since it was so last minute. 

This sparked a bit of a debate amongst our friends. Some agreed with me that it's reasonable to expect someone to pay for a concert ticket they used, especially when it costs a significant amount of money. Others sided with Sarah, saying that since I offered the ticket without mentioning repayment initially, it seemed like a kind gesture rather than a transaction. One friend pointed out that I should have clarified payment expectations upfront.

Now, a few weeks later, Sarah and I are still on speaking terms, but there's an awkward tension. She hasn't offered to pay me back, and I've been hesitant to push the issue further. My friends are split in their opinions, and it’s causing some strain on our group dynamics. 

Am I the asshole for expecting Sarah to pay me back for the concert ticket I let her use?"

We both love watching movies and decided to have regular movie nights to unwind and spend time together. However, early on, I noticed my boyfriend had a strong preference for certain types of films that I found quite problematic. I’m talking about movies that promote toxic masculinity, contain excessive violence, and have pretty misogynistic undertones. 

At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it became pretty clear to me that he had a pattern. I enjoy a wide range of films—indies, documentaries, comedies—but I found myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable during our movie nights. I gently brought it up to him, expressing how I felt about the themes and messages in some of the films he chose. I suggested that we could set a limit on how many of those types of movies we watch each month. 

He seemed to take it well, but a few weeks later, he casually mentioned it to a mutual friend. I overheard them chatting about “how controlling” I was being for wanting to limit our movie nights. The way he framed it made it sound like I was trying to dictate the entertainment, not expressing genuine concern about the messages these films send.

I understand movie preferences can be subjective, and he has every right to enjoy what he likes, but I also have the right to stand up against what I find troubling. Our friend told him that they thought he might be problematic for dismissing my feelings and characterizing it as controlling. I felt torn; I didn’t want to come across as the villain here, but I didn’t want to compromise my values to keep the peace during our movie nights. 

After some time, we had a heart-to-heart where I expressed my feelings about the situation. He admitted that he hadn't realized how much it affected me, and we agreed to be more mindful of each other’s preferences in the future. 

So, with everything that happened, am I the asshole for wanting to limit our movie nights and voicing my concerns about the kinds of films we watch? ","So I (30F) have been dating my boyfriend (32M) for about a year now. We live separately but spend weekends together, which sometimes includes movie nights. It used to be a fun thing we did together, but recently it’s been becoming an issue.

My boyfriend loves movies. Like, really loves them. He watches at least one movie every day and has an extensive collection of DVDs and streaming subscriptions. I enjoy movies too, but not to the same extent. I usually prefer to wind down with a book or some TV, and I don’t have the patience to sit through a 3-hour epic all the time.

Lately, he’s been insisting that we have movie marathons on weekends, choosing obscure films or really long ones. It feels overwhelming to me. I’ve suggested that we mix it up and do other activities, but he always comes back to wanting to watch movies. When I finally said I wanted to limit our movie nights to maybe one night a weekend, he got really upset and said I was stifling his passion.

I talked about this with some friends, and surprisingly, they took his side. They said it’s great to have someone so passionate about something and that I should be more supportive. One friend even went as far as to say it was problematic of me to try and change something he loves this much.

Now I’m feeling torn. I was trying to set a boundary for my own comfort, but I didn’t mean to hurt him or make him feel less appreciated. I know he isn’t trying to be inconsiderate, he just genuinely loves movies that much.

We’ve had a few discussions since then, and he seems to understand my need for variety, but it’s still a bit of a sore spot. He suggested we could take turns picking the activity, which seems like a fair compromise. I think we’re both trying to navigate this without stepping on each other’s toes, but it’s been a bit challenging.

Am I the asshole for wanting to limit our movie nights, even though it’s something he’s so passionate about?"

We were all excited, and I was looking forward to catching up with everyone. However, things took a turn that I didn’t see coming. 

While we were walking around, I found a pair of shoes that I really liked but they were a little out of my budget. I hesitated and took a few minutes to decide whether I should buy them or not. My friends, who had already been browsing for a while and were starting to get restless, kept asking me if I was ready to move on. I felt overwhelmed and pressured, and eventually told them to just go ahead without me since I didn’t want to rush my choice.

They agreed but promised to come back and check on me in 20 minutes. However, when I finally made my decision, I couldn’t find them anywhere. I waited for almost an hour, and every time I checked back near the store we had last been at, they weren’t there. I started to panic a bit and tried calling my friend’s phone, but she wouldn’t answer. After a while, I decided to wander around the mall searching for them but had no luck. 

A few hours later, I finally spotted them outside of a café, eating and laughing. I felt hurt and abandoned. When I approached them, they seemed surprised to see me and admitted they forgot about me. They said they were just ready to move on and didn’t think I’d take that long to decide.

Afterward, I vented a bit on social media, expressing how upset I felt about being left behind. Some of my other friends chimed in, supporting me, but I also heard from a few that I was overreacting and that it was my fault for taking too long. 

Looking back, I can see that I should have communicated better with my friends about how long I might take and perhaps I shouldn’t have let them leave without me. But at the same time, I felt they could have been more considerate. Now, there’s some tension in our group, and I’m feeling a bit isolated.

So, AITA for being upset about my friends leaving me behind at the mall?","I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some outside perspective. So last weekend, I went to the mall with a group of my friends—let’s call them Sarah, Mike, and Jess. We had planned to spend the day shopping, grabbing lunch, and just hanging out. It was supposed to be a fun day, but it turned into a mess.

We split up at the mall because Sarah wanted to check out a store that the rest of us weren't interested in. We agreed to meet up in an hour, so Mike, Jess, and I went our separate way. An hour later, I showed up at the meeting point on time, but Sarah was nowhere to be seen. Mike and Jess showed up a few minutes later, and we waited for another ten minutes. I suggested we call her, but Mike said she was always late and that we should just go ahead without her. Jess agreed, and reluctantly, I did too.

After another half hour of shopping, we ran into Sarah, who was clearly upset. She asked why we hadn't waited for her and why we didn’t answer her texts. Checking my phone, I realized I had missed a few messages and calls from her because it was on silent. She was furious and stormed off, saying she felt abandoned.

Mike then suggested we let her cool off, but I felt terrible and wanted to apologize. Jess told me Sarah was being overly dramatic and that she’d get over it. We eventually found her near the food court looking really upset. I tried to apologize, but she was having none of it and called us terrible friends for leaving her behind.

The day ended on a sour note, and we all went home. Ever since, Sarah has been giving me the cold shoulder. Mike and Jess think she’s overreacting and that it wasn’t a big deal, but I feel awful and think maybe I should’ve insisted we wait or at least keep trying to reach her.

Friends I've talked to are split—some say Sarah has a right to be upset, while others think she’s making a mountain out of a molehill. I feel like everyone, including myself, kind of messed up in one way or another.

So, AITA for being left behind by my friends at the mall? Or does everyone share a bit of the blame here?"

My sister-in-law has often voiced her frustrations about how they treat her, claiming they dismiss her opinions and make her feel unwelcome during family gatherings. Initially, I tried to stay out of it, thinking it was their problem to resolve.

However, it became a bit much when I overheard her venting to my brother about how his family behaved during a recent holiday dinner. They criticized her cooking, questioned her career choices, and even made a few snide remarks about her background. I felt terrible for her and thought my brother just wasn't seeing the whole picture.

In a moment of frustration, I ended up telling my mom about my sister-in-law's complaints. I thought she should know how her future daughter-in-law felt, and maybe it would encourage some change in how they treated her. I made it clear that I was only trying to help their relationship, but my sister-in-law found out and was furious with me. She confronted me, saying it was a breach of trust and that I shouldn't have involved my mom. 

Now, my mother has been trying to mediate, but my brother is caught in the middle, feeling like he needs to defend his fiancée while also keeping the peace with our family. Both my sister-in-law and my brother are upset with me, and I know my intentions were good, but I can’t shake the feeling that I might have messed things up.

I feel like I was trying to help, but now it seems I've created a bigger problem. Was I wrong for telling my mom about my sister-in-law’s complaints, or did I just want to look out for her? AITA for getting involved?","My sister-in-law, Katie, has always been outspoken, which I usually appreciate. She’s been with my brother, James, for about two years, and they recently got engaged. Now, our family is very close-knit and we have regular gatherings that Katie is often a part of.

Katie has a habit of venting to me about various things, which I was fine with until she started complaining about James' side of the family – particularly our mom. She would say things like how our mom is too nosy, overly affectionate, and sometimes even passive-aggressive. Katie often said she felt smothered and disrespected at family events. As much as I love my family, I could understand some of her points, but it became a bit much when I was continuously put in the middle.

One evening, Katie and I were having a private conversation, and she went on another rant about my mom. This time, it felt especially harsh. I tried talking to her about working through her concerns directly with my mom or maybe even James, but she brushed it off and kept unloading on me.

Eventually, the guilt of keeping this from my family got to me. I felt like I was betraying them by not saying anything, and Katie's constant complaints were starting to cloud my feelings about our family gatherings. So, I decided to tell my mom about Katie’s grievances. I thought maybe if she knew, she could adjust her behavior a bit to make Katie feel more comfortable. 

Predictably, it didn’t go well. My mom was hurt and defensive, which led to a huge argument during our next family get-together. Katie was furious with me for breaking her trust, and James was stuck in the middle, trying to mediate between all sides. Now, family gatherings are incredibly tense, and Katie has distanced herself from me. James is upset because he feels like I've stirred the pot unnecessarily.

Everyone feels betrayed or attacked, and I’m left wondering if I did the right thing by spilling the beans. I just wanted to help, but I’ve clearly made things worse.

92,92,AITA for forcing my MIL to babysit?,"Throwaway.    Ever since me (27F) and my husband Mark (30F) had our kids, my MIL had been begging to have them over every day. We live two hours away from her house, but we make sure to visit her on weekends as the kids love spending time at her place and playing with their cousins who live nearby too.   However whenever they’re at her house she never does anything for them. She doesn’t make them food, doesn’t look after them, and is generally just happy holding them or playing with them for a bit. Of course this is okay with us, and we are more than happy fixing them a quick snack or making sure they’re well. But lately she’s been calling me and Mark nonstop begging us to drop the kids at her place overnight. She says she misses spending ‘real’ quality time with them, and keeps saying I refuse to let her see them more than once a week. We tried to explain that with us being two hours away and the kids being a handful (they’re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her. She still insisted but we ended up saying no. She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn’t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only.   Into the issue. After saying goodbye to the kids Mark took me to a fancy restaurant halfway across town. He said that since the kids will be at their grandma’s place we can finally have quality time. I agreed and half an hour into our evening we got a call from MIL. I was afraid at first but she said nothing happened, she just asked when will we back. I replied that we will pick up the kids at 9 am the next day, and she immediately got upset. She said she couldn’t handle the kids and they kept demanding food, that she play with them, or straight up saying they want their cousins over. We tried telling her we are busy and at best will come over in a few hours, but she refused. She said she, and those are her exact words, “had her fill with the children and never expected such trouble”.

My husband (31M) and I have been together for several years, and while we generally get along well, there’s been a persistent issue with his mother (MIL, 60s) when it comes to caring for our kids.

When our first child was born, we were excited to have my husband’s family involved. Initially, my MIL seemed eager to help out, but things started to go downhill quickly. She would frequently show up late for babysitting, forget to feed the kids meals or provide them with snacks, and would often let them watch hours of TV without supervision. My husband and I expressed our concerns, and although she apologized and promised to be better, the same issues kept occurring.

Fast forward to now, and things haven’t improved. The last straw was when I discovered that she left our 4-year-old unattended while she took a phone call outside. Luckily, our child was safe, but it scared me to think of what could have happened. I confronted my MIL about it, and she dismissed my worries as “overreacting” and said I was being a “controlling” mother. This really hurt because I’m just trying to ensure my kids are safe and well taken care of.

Recently, my husband and I were invited to a wedding and needed someone to watch the kids for the evening. I suggested hiring a trusted babysitter instead, but my husband wanted to ask his mom again. I refused and said I didn’t trust her with our kids anymore, which led to a huge argument. My husband feels like I’m being unfair and that she deserves another chance to prove herself, while I feel that my children’s safety comes first.

His mom is now upset with me, and I feel bad for causing tension in the family, but at the same time, I can’t shake the feeling that my instincts are right. My husband’s sister has also weighed in, saying I’m too quick to judge their mom and should lighten up. Meanwhile, my parents have backed me up, agreeing that I have every right to be protective.

I never wanted to be the bad guy, but I also don’t want to compromise on my children's safety. So, AITA for not trusting my MIL to care for my kids after she continuously fails?","I (32F) have always had a strained relationship with my mother-in-law (MIL, 60F). From the start, she has been overly critical of my parenting style, constantly comparing my methods to hers. My husband (34M) tries to play peacemaker, but it often feels like he's stuck in the middle, which adds to the tension.

We have two kids, 5F and 3M, and as any parent knows, their safety and well-being are paramount. My MIL has offered to babysit on numerous occasions, but each time, something goes wrong. The first time, she fed our daughter food we specifically asked her to avoid due to allergies. Luckily, the reaction was mild, but it was a scare nonetheless.

Another time, she took both kids to a park without their car seats. She claimed that her generation didn't use them and that it was ""overprotective nonsense,"" but it's the law and for their safety. There was also an incident where she left them unattended in the bathtub, which I find absolutely unacceptable. When I brought it up, she brushed it off, saying she raised her kids just fine and that I worry too much.

After these experiences, I’ve been declining her offers to babysit, instead opting for our trusted nanny or my own parents. My MIL has noticed and confronted me about it, stating that I don’t trust her and that I'm being overly dramatic. I was honest and told her that her previous lapses in judgment make me uncomfortable relying on her for childcare.

She was furious and accused me of trying to alienate her from her grandchildren. She even went as far as to say that I'm trying to paint her as a bad grandmother, which is not my intention. My husband tried to mediate, suggesting we give her one more chance with clear guidelines, but I'm not confident she'd follow them. 

Some friends and family think I'm right to be cautious, especially with the kids' safety at stake. Others think I’m being too harsh and feel that everyone deserves a second (or third) chance, especially family. 

Now, my MIL is giving me the cold shoulder, and the tension is palpable during family gatherings. My husband is caught in the middle and it's causing some strain between us as well. 

Was I wrong for reaching my breaking point and refusing my MIL's help? Am I the asshole for not trusting her to care for my kids after she continuously fails?"

To give you a little background, we’ve been friends since middle school, and while we've always had our ups and downs, this particular incident has stuck with me.

Back in high school, there was a situation where I had been working really hard on a project for a class. I put in countless hours, and when it came time to present, Jess was supposed to be my partner. Just a night before the presentation, she backed out on me, saying she didn’t have time because she was ""too busy"" with other things. I was upset but managed to pull it off alone. I got a good grade, but it was bittersweet because I felt like I didn’t really get to share the credit with her.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we were reminiscing about school days, and Jess brought up the subject of teamwork. I couldn’t help but bring up the incident. I expressed that her backing out really hurt me at the time and that I had to carry the load alone. Jess got defensive and argued that I was just holding onto the past and that she was a different person now. 

I didn’t mean to bring up old wounds, but I felt like it was important to address how her actions impacted me. Instead of a mature discussion, we ended up in a screaming match, and it got pretty ugly. Now, Jess hasn’t spoken to me since, and I’ve been reflecting on whether it was justified for me to bring it up after so long.

Some of our mutual friends think I was wrong to bring it up at all, claiming I’m just being petty. Others support me, saying that we shouldn't have unresolved feelings about the past. I genuinely believed it was time to have an honest conversation, but I’m starting to wonder if I should have let it go instead. 

So, AITA for getting into an argument with Jess over something that happened years ago?","Back in high school, my friend Jake and I were part of a tight-knit group of friends. We had our ups and downs like any group, but we generally got along well. There was this one incident, though, that always bothered me. Our mutual friend, Sarah, had a massive crush on Jake. She confessed her feelings to him at a party, and he completely brushed her off in a pretty humiliating way, making jokes about it in front of everyone. Sarah was devastated and ended up leaving the party early. It stuck with me because I thought Jake could have handled it better, even if he didn't feel the same way about her.

Fast forward to now, we're all adults, and our lives have moved on. Jake and I were hanging out last weekend, and somehow, the conversation drifted to high school memories. I brought up the incident with Sarah and told him how I thought he was a jerk back then for the way he treated her. Jake was taken aback and got defensive, saying it was years ago and that he’s changed since then. He also said it wasn’t fair to judge him by his teenage actions and that everyone made mistakes when they were younger. Things escalated quickly, and we ended up having a heated argument.

I said some things I probably shouldn't have, accusing him of still being inconsiderate and self-centered. Jake stormed out, and now he's not responding to my texts or calls. Our other friends have mixed opinions. Some think I was right to call him out, while others say I was out of line to bring up something from so long ago, especially when it's clear Jake has moved past it.

Sarah, who I'm still in touch with, said she appreciated me standing up for her but also mentioned that she's long since forgiven Jake and moved on with her life. She thinks it's not worth jeopardizing my friendship with Jake over something that happened years ago.

Now, I'm stuck wondering if I was the asshole for dragging up old memories and causing a rift with Jake over an incident that everyone else seems to have left in the past. Am I the asshole here?"

We brought our new furry friend home and immediately started brainstorming names. I’ve always been a little traditional when it comes to pet names, and I lean towards names that reflect their personality or appearance. My partner, on the other hand, has a quirky sense of humor and tends to think outside the box.

After we tossed around some names, my partner suggested naming our cat ""SuperDog"" as a playful twist, considering the cat is kind of big and fluffy. I’ll admit, his intention was all in good fun, but I just couldn’t get behind it. I found the name embarrassing and thought it would be a bit ridiculous to call our cat that. I even imagined how it would sound in public, like at the vet’s office, and it just didn’t sit right with me.

I expressed my feelings to my partner, and he laughed it off, saying it was just a joke and that we could ultimately name the cat whatever we wanted. He thought it would be fun to tell people about the name, but for me, I felt it was too much of a stretch. We went back and forth a bit, with him teasing me, but I stood my ground because I thought it didn’t capture the essence of our new pet.

We finally decided to take a break from naming and just enjoy getting to know our cat first. Both of us have friends who are supportive of either side of the naming debate. Some think ""SuperDog"" is hilarious, while others agree with me that it’s a bit silly. 

In the end, we’re still in the process of figuring out a name that fits our new family member. My partner didn’t get mad or anything, and we ended up bonding over some cute moments with the cat. However, I’m still wondering if I came off too strong for refusing a name that could potentially make him laugh. So, am I the asshole for refusing to name our adopted cat ""SuperDog"" because I think it’s embarrassing?","My partner (27M) and I (26F) recently adopted a cat from the local animal shelter, and we're both really excited to give her a loving home. She’s a sweet little calico with the most adorable face, and we instantly fell in love with her. This is the first pet we've adopted together, so it's a pretty big deal for both of us.

Here's where the issue comes in: my partner has a quirky sense of humor, and he's always coming up with goofy names for things. He suggested we name our new cat ""SuperDog."" I thought he was joking at first, but it turns out he's dead serious. He thinks it's hilarious and believes that the name adds a unique charm to our pet. He even laughed about how funny it would be to call out ""SuperDog"" at the vet or when introducing her to friends.

I, on the other hand, think the name is a bit too much. I get his point about it being humorous, but I feel like it's more embarrassing than anything else. I wanted a sweet and simple name like ""Luna"" or ""Bella,"" something that fits her gentle personality and makes me smile every time I say it. We had a bit of a disagreement over this, with me arguing that while quirky names are fun, they should still be respectable.

We haven't come to a decision yet, and it's causing a slight rift between us. Some of our friends think ""SuperDog"" is hilarious and support his idea, while others agree with me that the name is a bit over the top. My partner and I are otherwise on great terms, and this is the first time something so seemingly trivial has caused tension between us. 

So far, we’ve just been calling her “kitty” or “sweetheart,” and she seems to respond to anything said in a loving tone. I’m worried that if we don’t resolve this soon, it might create an unnecessary strain. I understand his perspective and don't want to diminish his enthusiasm, but I also want to feel comfortable with our pet's name.

Am I the asshole for refusing to name our adopted cat ""SuperDog"" because I think it's embarrassing?"

I didn't mention it bc it's none of my business and people smoke all the time in the city. I also figured she was noseblind to it and felt it would be rude/embarrassing to bring it up since there wasn't much she could do.  During the movie, her roommate and his friend each took a hit from a homemade gravity bong they'd recently made. They didn't go out onto the fire escape and the smell was strong.

We’ve been through a lot together, and we have a great bond. However, Sam has a habit of smoking weed whenever we hang out, and it’s really started to bother me. I’m not against weed in itself—I understand it can be therapeutic and fun, but I personally don't smoke or enjoy being around it.

The issue is that I have some anxiety and a bit of a history with substance abuse in my family, so being around it makes me uncomfortable. I’ve never brought it up with Sam because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings or create any tension between us. I really value our friendship and the last thing I want to do is make him feel judged or unwelcome. 

Every time we hang out, I find myself anxiously waiting for him to pull out his stash, hoping he won’t, but then he always does. I kind of just go along with it and try to distract myself, but it’s definitely affecting how much I enjoy our time together. I’ve also noticed I’ve been avoiding reaching out to him as much because I worry about the weed situation.

Recently, I mentioned this to a mutual friend who seemed surprised I hadn’t said anything to Sam yet. They said I should confront Sam and express how I feel. That really got me thinking. I don’t want to lose a great friend, but I also want to be true to myself and my feelings.

I tried to bring it up casually in a conversation the next time we hung out, but I just froze and couldn’t get the words out. Instead, I ended up acting like everything was fine, and he lit up right in front of me. The situation remains the same, and I just feel stuck.

Now, I feel a bit guilty for not saying anything but at the same time, I don’t want to come off as judgmental or push him away. So, AITA for being too afraid to ask my friend not to smoke weed around me?","I (22F) have a close friend, Sarah (23F), who I've known since high school. Sarah has always been a bit of a free spirit, and recently, she's gotten into smoking weed. I really don't have a problem with people using weed, but personally, it makes me very uncomfortable. I have a bit of a history with substances due to family issues, and the smell alone brings back some pretty bad memories.

Sarah's a great friend and has been there for me through a lot. I really don't want to seem like I'm judging her or risking our friendship over something that is legal here, especially since I know it helps her with anxiety. The problem is, every time we hang out at her place now, there's a strong smell of weed, and sometimes she lights up while I'm there. I haven't said anything because I don't want her to feel bad or think I'm trying to control her life. 

Recently, we were planning a movie night at her apartment, and just as I was about to go over, I found myself making excuses not to go. I realized that I was avoiding her place because of the weed, and it made me feel even worse. I ended up going, but I still couldn't bring myself to say anything when she started smoking.

When I talked to a couple of mutual friends about it, they had mixed reactions. One understood where I was coming from but said I should just be honest with Sarah. The other friend thought I was overreacting and that I needed to just deal with it since it's her place and her choice.

For now, I'm stuck between wanting to be a good friend by supporting her choices and needing to take care of my own mental well-being. I don't want to end up distancing myself from her, but I'm genuinely too afraid to bring it up. It's eating me up inside, and I'm not sure what to do.

96,96,AITA for not Photoshopping my Stillborn Aunt into a Family Photo?,"There's a little known fact in my family (at least among the cousins and grandkids), that one of my aunts, Aunt Ann, was supposed to be a twin, but her twin sister was stillborn. It's not exactly a taboo topic or anything, just some random trivia that never has any reason to come up in conversation.  One day, I was visiting my Grandma, and showing her how I was using Photoshop for one of my school projects. She seemed really interested, got quiet for moment, and then got up and pulled a small diary out of her closet. She started talking, and to my surprise, I learned that she had named her lost baby, Sophia Rose. Every year she would write a birthday message in the diary, just to remember her. She had never told anybody all these years, because back then, that sort of thing just wasn't talked about. But now she wondered if there were any way I could photoshop another picture of Aunt Ann into her favorite family picture, so it looked like her twin was there. She had always wondered what it would've looked like with her family completed.  I, of course, was quite willing to do it. My Aunt Ann was having lunch with my mother and I a few days later, and I thought I'd run the idea by her then and ask her if she had a nice picture I could use.  But, to my surprise, both my mom and Aunt Ann were horrified with the idea. Aunt Ann especially said she didn't want it done, that using her picture for a dead person was morbid and creeped her out. It would be her face representing a ghost. Plus, apparently they weren't even identical twins, just fraternal, so they wouldn't have actually looked alike. She very clearly didn't feel comfortable with it.  I figured I probably shouldn't do it since Aunt Ann had quite clearly said no. When I told her, Grandma didn't seem upset or disappointed, she just said that she understood, and thanked me for looking into it.

It included my grandma, my parents, my siblings, my aunt, and her kids. The problem is that my aunt (45F) is usually pretty critical about how everyone looks, and she has a habit of suggesting edits or changes to our photos that can be pretty harsh.

After the event, my grandma reached out to me to ask if I could help her with a family photo. She wanted me to Photoshop it to remove some ""flaws"" she noticed, which I thought was harmless. However, when I mentioned this to my aunt, she got really upset. She believes that any touch-ups should be discussed with her first since she’s very particular about how the kids' appearances are portrayed, and she has previously asked me not to alter photos too heavily without consulting her.

I get where my aunt is coming from; she wants to maintain a certain standard and protect her kids’ images, which I respect. But my grandma, who is getting older and a bit self-conscious, just wanted something nice for her wall. I thought this might be a simple gesture to brighten her day, and I didn't want my aunt to burst that bubble by being overly negative about it.

I ended up telling my grandma that I'd rather not do it unless my aunt was on board first, even though my grandma insisted she was fine with it. My aunt thinks I should have just done it and let her handle the fallout, but I felt it was important to respect her wishes as well.

Now, I'm feeling conflicted. My grandma is disappointed, and my aunt feels validated. I’m really caught in the middle here. Am I the asshole for wanting to respect my aunt’s wishes even though it upset my grandma?","I (28F) am a graphic designer, and I often help out my family with small design projects when they need it. Recently, my grandma (75F) asked me if I could Photoshop a family photo to include my aunt (52F) who couldn't make it to the last family gathering. Grandma loves having complete family pictures on her mantel, and it really bothers her that my aunt wasn't in this one.

Here's where things get tricky – my aunt and I are close, and she’s made it very clear in the past that she doesn’t like being Photoshopped into pictures. She prefers to be in photos that she was actually present for. I understand her point of view, as she feels that being added in later feels a bit artificial and disingenuous. 

When I gently explained this to my grandma, suggesting we wait until the next family gathering to take a new photo, she got a bit upset. She said she misses having the whole family together in one picture and would love to look at it every day. I tried to propose a compromise, like doing a collage or something similar, but she wasn't interested.

My family is now divided on this. My mom thinks that I should just Photoshop the picture because it would make grandma happy, and she doesn't think my aunt would find out or even mind that much if she did. Some of my cousins agree with my mom, arguing that it's not a big deal and is just for grandma’s happiness. However, a few other relatives think I should respect my aunt's preference and not do it without her consent.

The current outcome is that the photo remains unaltered, and it’s caused a bit of tension. Grandma feels like I’m prioritizing my aunt's feelings over hers, and while I understand her perspective, I really don’t want to go against my aunt’s wishes. Now I’m stuck in the middle and feeling conflicted.

So, AITA for refusing to Photoshop the family photo without my aunt's consent, even if it means disappointing my grandma?"

There were 2 bunk beds with trundle beds underneath and a single bed. Amelia is very sick and can\'t sleep on the top bunk because she has a hard time getting up and down the ladder. The trundles are also out of the question because she has a hard time standing up when she\'s that close to the ground. That leaves the bottom bunks and the single bed.

We’ve been friends for years, but we've drifted a bit lately due to some life changes. However, I still consider Sarah a close friend, and I'm excited to celebrate her special day. The thing is, my ex-friend Jess (28F) is also going to be there.

Jess and I had a falling out a few months ago over a pretty serious issue. We had been friends for a long time, but the situation was really hurtful, and I just can't be around her anymore. When I heard she was on the guest list for Sarah's party, I felt a wave of anxiety. I explained my feelings to Sarah, saying that I would prefer not to attend if Jess was going to be there. I didn't outright demand it, but I did heavily imply that it would mean a lot to me if she could consider not inviting Jess.

Sarah responded by saying she doesn't want to choose sides and that she values both of our friendships. She acknowledged my feelings but made it clear that she doesn't want to exclude anyone from her celebration. I understand where she’s coming from, but I felt like she was being insensitive to my situation. I even said that I would feel uncomfortable and would likely leave early if Jess was there, but Sarah stuck to her position.

Now, I’m stuck in this weird situation. Some of my friends think I was right to express my feelings about Jess coming, but others believe I overstepped boundaries by asking Sarah to exclude someone from her life. I’m feeling terrible about the whole thing, especially since I really want to support Sarah’s birthday but can’t shake the thought of running into Jess.

Ultimately, I don’t want to hurt Sarah’s feelings or put her in an awkward position with our mutual friends, but I just wish she would take my side in this. So, AITA for expecting Sarah to not invite Jess to her birthday party?","So, here's a bit of backstory: I (28F) used to be best friends with Sarah (28F) for over a decade. We were inseparable until about a year ago when we had a huge falling out over some pretty personal stuff. We haven't spoken since, and it's been really awkward because we have a lot of mutual friends. One of those mutual friends is Emma (28F), who I know through Sarah but wouldn't really consider a close friend myself.

Emma's birthday is coming up, and she's planning a big party with all of our common friends. I was really looking forward to it because it's been a while since I've had a chance to unwind and catch up with everyone. But then I found out that Sarah is also invited. Emma has every right to invite whomever she wants to her party, but I just can't stand the thought of being in the same room with Sarah given our past. The tension between us makes social gatherings unbearable for me, and I was honestly hoping to avoid her as much as possible.

I ended up texting Emma to ask if she could exclude Sarah from the party, explaining how uncomfortable it would make me feel. Emma replied saying that she values both of us as friends and doesn’t want to take sides or exclude anyone. She suggested that I try to find a way to coexist with Sarah for the evening since it was her birthday celebration and it should be a happy occasion for everyone.

When I received Emma’s response, I felt a mix of disappointment and frustration. I told her that it was insensitive of her to expect me to be around someone who had hurt me so deeply, and that true friends should show more understanding of my feelings. Emma responded by saying she was sorry I felt that way but reiterated that she couldn’t uninvite Sarah and hoped I would reconsider attending.

Upon sharing this with a few of our mutual friends, opinions were split. Some thought that Emma should have sided with me because of how close Sarah and I used to be, while others believed that Emma was right to remain neutral and keep her guest list unchanged. My boyfriend thinks I was out of line to expect Emma to alter her plans for my comfort and says I'm making this about me when it should be about celebrating Emma.

So now, I’m left questioning my actions. Should I have kept my feelings to myself instead of asking Emma to pick sides? Am I the asshole for expecting my non-friend to exclude my ex-friend from her birthday party?"

Over the past year, my financial situation has changed significantly. I lost my job due to company downsizing and, while I’ve been searching for a new one, my savings are dwindling. I've been upfront with my friends about my struggles and have asked them to be understanding when planning outings, whether it’s dinners, trips, or any other activities that require spending money.

Recently, we planned a weekend getaway to a cabin in the mountains, and at first, I hesitated to go because I knew the costs would add up. However, my friends reassured me that they were going to keep things budget-friendly. They promised that we’d share meals and split costs as evenly as possible. I decided to tag along, hoping to have a good time but also keeping an eye on my wallet.

The first night, we decided to order pizza, and I contributed what I could, which was less than half of what everyone else put in. I asked them to please keep my budget in mind for the rest of the trip, and they agreed. The next day, while we were out hiking, they suggested a restaurant for lunch that looked a bit pricey. I mentioned again that I’d prefer something more affordable, but they dismissed my concerns, saying it was a “special occasion.”

When the bill came, I was charged the full amount of the meal, including a share of drinks I didn’t partake in and appetizers I didn’t want. I was really frustrated and expressed how unfair it was that they charged me this without any discussion. I ended up getting into a heated argument with my friends about how they didn’t respect my financial situation, claiming they’d promised to accommodate me.

In the end, I ended up paying the amount without any further argument but left feeling really upset and disappointed. A few of my friends say I overreacted and should have just paid my share without getting mad, while others agree that we should have discussed costs more openly. I’m wondering if I should have just kept quiet and sucked it up, or if I was right to expect some understanding from my friends regarding my situation.

So, AITA for expecting my friends to understand my financial situation and then getting mad when I was charged for something I didn't agree to?","I've recently found myself in a bit of a financial bind. My hours got cut at work and I’m trying to make ends meet while looking for a better job. My friends know about my situation and have been generally supportive, or so I thought.

Last weekend, a group of us decided to go out for dinner at a fairly nice restaurant. I told them upfront that I couldn’t really afford to go all out and they said it was fine, they’d cover my meal this time and I could pay them back when I could. I was really grateful and made sure to order something small and inexpensive to minimize what I owed.

Everything seemed to be going well until the bill came. One of my friends suggested we just split the bill evenly to make it easier. This made no sense to me since some of them had ordered multiple courses, drinks, and desserts, while I had only ordered a small appetizer. I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable with this and reminded them of my situation.

My friends assured me it was fine and they didn’t mind covering the extra cost. I thought I was in the clear, but then, a few days later, one of them sent me a Venmo request for my share, which was way more than what I had consumed. I was livid and felt completely blindsided.

When I confronted them, they said they thought I was okay with splitting the bill evenly since I didn’t say anything more at the restaurant, and that they expected me to pay them back eventually anyway. I felt betrayed because they had initially said they would cover me, and now they were acting like I was trying to freeload.

I ended up paying the Venmo request because I didn’t want to cause more drama, but I’m still really upset about it. Some of my friends say I’m overreacting and that it’s just money, while others say they understand but think I should have clarified things better at the time.

Now I’m questioning if I handled this the right way or if I’m the asshole for expecting my friends to accommodate my financial situation and then getting mad when they charged me. So, AITA for expecting friends to understand and accommodate my financial situation, then getting mad when I got charged?"

I (28F) have been going through a particularly tough time lately. Work has been overwhelming, and I recently lost a family member, which has taken a huge emotional toll on me. I’ve been trying to deal with everything as best as I can, but it’s been hard.

My husband has been supportive on the surface, but I’ve noticed some of his actions have been making me feel a bit overlooked. For instance, he really loves playing video games. Normally, I’m totally okay with him enjoying his hobbies; I mean, everyone needs an escape sometimes. But this past week, when I’ve been feeling particularly low and in need of support, I found him spending hours gaming while I was home alone, trying to process my feelings. 

One night, I had a mini meltdown. I was feeling overwhelmed and just wanted to talk about everything that was bothering me. When I went to find him, I saw he was deeply focused on a game and didn’t even hear me calling for him. I eventually sat down next to him and tried to express how I felt—how I wished he would prioritize time for me during this tough period. He seemed frustrated, saying he needed that time to unwind and that I could have just joined him if I wanted to spend time together.

After I expressed my feelings, he apologized and said he didn't mean to make me feel overlooked. However, he also emphasized that he believes it’s crucial for both of us to have our own ways of dealing with stress, which I totally understand. We had a good conversation after that, and he made an effort to spend more time with me in the following days. 

My friends seem to have differing opinions. Some think that I’m being too needy and that he deserves his own space, while others see my feelings as valid and agree that in a partnership, it’s important to make room for each other’s emotional needs. I'm just grateful we talked about it, but I can’t shake the feeling of guilt for having voiced my needs when he has his own stress to deal with.

So, AITA for feeling overlooked when my husband needed to prioritize his own needs during a tough time?","I'm having a really tough time right now and I'm not sure if my feelings are justified. My husband (36M) and I (34F) have been married for ten years. We usually have a pretty balanced relationship where we take care of each other's needs, but recently things have been hard for me.

About a month ago, I lost my job unexpectedly, which has been a massive blow to my self-esteem and our financial stability. On top of that, my mother has been very ill, and I've been trying to spend as much time as possible with her, which adds to my emotional strain. These events have taken a toll on me, and I've been feeling overwhelmed and isolated.

My husband is a very driven person and has a demanding job. He's been working late almost every night, which means he hasn't been home much to support me. When he is home, he often retreats to his office to unwind or play video games, saying he needs time to decompress. I understand that he needs his own space and time to relax after a long day, but it's been hard for me to cope without his presence and support.

I've tried to talk to him about how I'm feeling, and he listens, but his actions remain the same. He tells me he loves me and that he's sorry for not being around more, and he assures me that he's working hard to provide for our future. I appreciate his efforts and intentions, but I can't help feeling overlooked and unsupported during this difficult period.

My friends have mixed opinions on the matter—some say I should cut him some slack because he's also dealing with his own pressures, while others believe he should be making more effort to support me emotionally.

Right now, our relationship isn't in any immediate danger, but I can't deny that I'm feeling really lonely and overwhelmed. I want to be understanding of his needs, but I also feel like my needs are being neglected.

So, am I the asshole for feeling overlooked when my husband prioritizes his own needs over mine during this bad time?"
