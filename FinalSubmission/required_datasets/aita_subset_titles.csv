0,AITA for asking my friend to move a picture of him and his wife because it made my wife uncomfortable?,"  Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.   Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that!   For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.   Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was ""bonkers"" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some ""explicit"" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such ""demand"" and be pushy still.   This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.   Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Post:   Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily.

2,"AITA for wanting to meet my ""daughter"" after giving up my parental rights?","Long story short: in my (40f) twenties I had a one night stand with this guy ""Nathan"" (now 41m) and got pregnant. I first thought of having an abortion, but Nathan had come from a conservative religious background (not Christian) and wanted the baby so we made a deal: I would give birth to the child and sign away my parental rights (my name is not even in her birth certificate, it's a possibility in my country) and he would pay all the medical expenses plus some extra for my troubles. That's what we did and didn't keep contact after his daughter was born.  A few weeks ago, a friend of mine who has the same religion as Nathan sent me a post from her temple's youth group (they were asking for donations for the homeless) and one of the girls from the picture looked a lot like me. I searched for her profile and found out that she had Nathan's surname and had the right age to be the baby I gave away. She's 17 now and seems to be doing fine: she is involved in charity work, apparently loves music and has lots of pictures with friends and family (Nathan, his wife and half-siblings).  I never wanted nor want to be a mother but I became curious to know more about this human I put in the world, so I texted Nathan's old phone number, which he has not changed, and asked if he would allow me to meet his daughter, since I gave birth to her and everything, and made my intentions clear: I do not want to interfere with his family, just to know her. He then wrote a long text which comes down to the fact that I am an asshole for wanting to know his daughter now after I ""abandoned"" her and that this meeting would only mess up with her head. I told him I was telling him out of courtesy because soon the girl will be an adult and be able to choose herself if she wants to meet me. He then blocked me.  Am I being the asshole here? I don't think there is any harm in meeting my ""daughter""; she already has a great family and it would only be beneficial to her to know about her own history. But maybe I am not seeing the full picture.  Also sorry for any mistakes or weird phrases, English is not my first language.  &#x200B;  UPDATE  Hi everyone. First of all, thank you for your judgement. Some of you were were pretty harsh and a bit misogynistic to be honest, but I needed to hear what the well-intentioned comments had to say. Some answers to common assumptions:   1. I wasn’t coherced into giving birth.  Nathan and I reached an agreement in a situation that involved us both. I’ll admit that I was young, didn’t know what pregnancy was really like and needed the money (which I’m not proud of but hey y’all are gonna judge me anyway).  2. I didn’t want to reach out to Nathan’s daughter just because she looks like me. I only mentioned it because this is what made me realize that the girl on the picture was the child I gave birth to, but it blew out of proportion.   3. I don’t know why some people assumed Nathan is Christian and why they were judging him for being religious. He is Jewish and I am agnostic myself but don’t think it’s a problem for him to have a strong bond with his religion. The one night stand happened when we were very young and I don’t know what his views are about that, but it doesn’t matter. His daughter apparently is very attached to their community and it’s important to her. Also I might have used the world temple wrong but I’m not Jewish myself.   4. When I said I don’t want to be a mother I didn’t mean I didn’t want a relationship with Nathan's daughter. I am not her mother since I didn’t raise and don’t want to take this place from the person who truly did: his wife. I also chose not to have children of my own.  So after reading your comments, I came to a better understanding of what my role is in this situation and decided to reach out to his wife through social media to try to make amends. She was very understanding and explained to me that Nathan had a couple of tough years being a single dad before meeting her and me coming back like that made it seem (like some of you pointed out) that I wanted to skip the hard parts and become a parent out of nowhere, which was never my intention. They told their daughter that her birth mother had to go back to her home country and couldn't  take care of her, which was kind. The wife is going to talk to Nathan to leave the door open if their daughter wants to meet me when she’s older and I gave her all my contact information for when and if the time comes. I'll admit I was being a bit selfish here, so that is the best ending I could hope for.

3,AITA for making my roommate replace my garlic that she used?,"Last week, I came home and my roommate told me that without asking me, she had used the garlic I had in the fridge. I was bothered that she didn’t bother to ask me when it would take a two minute text exchange. She just expected I’d be okay with her using something I bought because we lived together, and didn’t think of how it could inconvenience me if I needed to use garlic that night. To be fair to her, she said she’d replace it, but didn’t give any timeline on when that would be.   And some important context: my current roommate knows I had a history of shitty roommates that take advantage of my kindness. I chose her specifically because I didn’t expect she’d be the type to do that. Hence why this stung.   Anyways, told her I was upset that she used it, and that she needed to replace it tonight. She fought back, but went out and bought some.   She came back with the garlic cloves separated and peeled instead of a fresh bulb. In my opinion, there is a difference in how the two taste, and I told her I wanted the actual bulb instead of what she got me. She started complaining but went and bought the bulb, which should have ended things.

I was bothered that she didn’t bother to ask me when it would take a two minute text exchange. She just expected I’d be okay with her using something I bought because we lived together, and didn’t think of how it could inconvenience me if I needed to use garlic that night. To be fair to her, she said she’d replace it, but didn’t give any timeline on when that would be.   And some important context: my current roommate knows I had a history of shitty roommates that take advantage of my kindness. I chose her specifically because I didn’t expect she’d be the type to do that. Hence why this stung.   Anyways, told her I was upset that she used it, and that she needed to replace it tonight. She fought back, but went out and bought some.   She came back with the garlic cloves separated and peeled instead of a fresh bulb. In my opinion, there is a difference in how the two taste, and I told her I wanted the actual bulb instead of what she got me. She started complaining but went and bought the bulb, which should have ended things.   I had forgiven her and moved on, but apparently she’s been telling our friends a filtered version of the story to make me look bad and apparently mocking me for it, which obviously hurts.

4,AITA for bringing my wheelchair bound boyfriend to my brother's no +1 wedding?," My f31 brother m33 got married days ago. He and his now wife sent me an invitation and mentioned a ""no +1"" rule.

7,AITA for beating my coworker's kid at super smash bros.,"So this happened at a small Halloween get together I went to with a few work friends. A lot of them are older than me (28) and are at the point that they have kids like the person whose house we were. They are somewhere in their 50's I don't know the exact age but they have a few kids the youngest of which was like 8 or 9 and was at the party.   The kid is just bored and trying to do something, his dad mentions that I might play some of the same games he does and yeah sure enough we both play smash brothers. Kids asks if I want to play a game and I'm bored so I agree.  This is where I totally wipe the floor with the kid. Like no contest at all. He trys several different game modes and rules to try and get a win in and he takes the l every time. After a few losses he's getting visibly frustrated, his teenaged sibling tries to keep him calm to no avail. I just keep letting the kid play me as long as he wanted to, i wasnt particularly egging him on or anything either i would usually just ask if he wanted to go again.  Eventually the kid has a mini tantrum and his dad has to stop what he's doing to scold him and send him to bed. It was a little awkward for everyone.  No one ever directly put blame on me for it but I could kinda tell from the vibe in the room that they low key blamed me for the outburst as well. And there were lots of small Comments saying things like I was a little harsh or asking why I couldn't just let him win one, or why I didn't stop playing with him after he started getting mad. I just told them I was having fun and left it at that.  I'll admit to not being the best read on social situations but I feel like none of the blame should be put on me at all. I don't feel particularly obligated to go easy on him just because he's a kid. I'm not like a go to tournaments smash player but I'm at least decent at it and I didn't hold back at all when playing him. Which I didn't see an issue with but reading the room afterwards it seems like maybe I should have.

8,AITA for wanting to charge my niece rent while living in our apartment?,"Me (47) and my husband 'Tom' (50) have a daughter 'Alice' (20).

Her parents live in a different state but she moved here for college, not the same as Alice, a significantly more expensive one.

We've talked to Alice and she's fine having Rose stay with her.  Tom is insisting we let Rose stay for free, but I think she should pay rent. Rose said she'd cover utilities and food, and he's insisting that's more than enough and we should help her out.

10,AITA for kicking my friend out of my bridal party when she's been excluding me?,"Throw away account -   So one of my friends of 15+ years, we'll call her Chelsea, got engaged to her bf of 7 years this year in February and 5 months later in June, I also got engaged to my bf of 4 years.   Because I'm currently in school for my teaching credentials, I need to get married end of June 2024 because that was my only break from school. I asked Chelsea when she was looking to have her wedding and she told me she already picked a date and it was in July 2024 - only 1 week after my wedding. When I told her the date I wanted, she called her venue and moved it another week out, but that still only leaves our weddings 2 weeks apart. I told her I wouldn't be able to make it since I'll probably still be on my honeymoon and she said she was okay with it, but I was annoyed that she's so nonchalant with me not being able to attend.   The plan was to have each other as bridesmaids so I asked her to be mine, but she didn't ask me because I won't be at the wedding, which I get, but now it feels like I'm no longer part of the friend group.  A few months ago, she texts me and my friends that she's having a dinner to celebrate her engagement and I told her I couldn't make it because I had a trip planned. On the day of my trip, my flight got delayed to the next day so I could've attended, but I didn't know when or where the dinner was because she never even bothered to send me an official invite.   Throughout the last few months, she's been texting our group chats trying to plan her bridal shower and bachelorette, but I didn't respond because I was still hurt about not being invited to the dinner and I just got busy with work. On facebook, I see that she posts a confirmation email of her booking her Miami bach trip with our friends, but didn't bother texting me separately to see if I could come.

He even went so far as to ask her best friends to nag her into going, which upset her greatly. OP is now questioning whether to book the appointment without her knowledge, potentially disregarding her feelings and fears about her weight and body image.

Last year my wife took the kids trick or treating, so this year I did. It was pretty tiring.

I met up with his parents, they loved me and I loved them, I gave them the biscuits and they loved the attention, but here's the thing : my boyfriend's parents have been separated for decades now, because of a very sad story that tore their family apart (my bf's bio mom cheated on his dad) and even though he denies it, and doesn't show it, he still resents her for it. Word travels lightning fast in our small town, and she found out that I met up with my bf's dad and stepmom, and she was apparently quite saddened by the news, but understands. I told my boyfriend that it was only fair that we'd meet up with her as well and he said okay. I told him I'd make biscuits for her too, and he already seemed not to like the idea...The day before meeting up, my boyfriend enters the kitchen and sees me baking the same biscuits I gave his dad and stepmom earlier, but for his mom, this time.

20,AITA for refusing to sit with my partner?,"throwaway, etc.  I live with two roommates and my partner, Fred. We have been having a fair amount of on and off tension with one of the roommates, Amy. Amy, who I do care about a lot, has a long trauma history and can be very combative and argumentative when she's feeling defensive. Honestly a generally argumentative person. Fred and Amy have been in the majority of the conflict-- while they share a lot of common interests and views, they bring out the worst in each other and there's been a lot of discontent that they've worked to resolve and set aside.  On to tonight: Amy, Fred and I were headed out to an event and were planning to meet our other roommate there. On the way, Fred and Amy get into an argument about how rent is paid (we all venmo Fred and then he pays our landlord. He is asking for the venmo to be sent a few days prior to the 1st of the month so he can send rent on time. Amy is resistant to this and doesn't want to elaborate further.)  I could give you a play by play of the exact argument, but I think it's safe to say neither handled it well and it escalated quickly to yelling and vitriol. I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story. I asked them both to be quiet and essentially said: I can see there's a miscommunication, it's not appropriate or productive to keep yelling mean things so knock it off. They were both eventually able to stop and don't speak for the rest of the ride.  He drops us off and parks the car. They don't speak in line but both speak with me normally. When we're settled, he says he doesn't want to sit by Amy and goes off to sit by himself, indicating I should go with him.  Here's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: I had set up the blanket and we were expecting our friends. I felt like it was an escalation to take a stand and go sit alone with Fred rather than for Amy and Fred to continue to keep distance and resolve at a later time. While it was super clear that Amy started the original rent issue by refusing to communicate, neither handled it well and I was upset with both of them.  I went off to call a friend and vent. Fred came up to me and insisted I go sit with him or he was going to leave and take the car with him, leaving Amy and I to find our own way home. He said he wouldn't tolerate being treated like this (a common feeling he has about Amy) and needed me to take a stand with him. I felt like he was putting me between a rock and a hard place. I told him explicitly, repeatedly, that I agreed with him, side with him, know it's wrong, and just don't agree with his actions handling it after the fact. I think he felt betrayed and like I wasn't taking his side.  I was able to convince him to leave me the car because I felt that was kind of rude, and he went home on his own.

We have been having a fair amount of on and off tension with one of the roommates, Amy. Amy, who I do care about a lot, has a long trauma history and can be very combative and argumentative when she's feeling defensive. Honestly a generally argumentative person. Fred and Amy have been in the majority of the conflict-- while they share a lot of common interests and views, they bring out the worst in each other and there's been a lot of discontent that they've worked to resolve and set aside.  On to tonight: Amy, Fred and I were headed out to an event and were planning to meet our other roommate there. On the way, Fred and Amy get into an argument about how rent is paid (we all venmo Fred and then he pays our landlord. He is asking for the venmo to be sent a few days prior to the 1st of the month so he can send rent on time. Amy is resistant to this and doesn't want to elaborate further.)  I could give you a play by play of the exact argument, but I think it's safe to say neither handled it well and it escalated quickly to yelling and vitriol. I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story. I asked them both to be quiet and essentially said: I can see there's a miscommunication, it's not appropriate or productive to keep yelling mean things so knock it off. They were both eventually able to stop and don't speak for the rest of the ride.  He drops us off and parks the car. They don't speak in line but both speak with me normally. When we're settled, he says he doesn't want to sit by Amy and goes off to sit by himself, indicating I should go with him.  Here's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: I had set up the blanket and we were expecting our friends. I felt like it was an escalation to take a stand and go sit alone with Fred rather than for Amy and Fred to continue to keep distance and resolve at a later time. While it was super clear that Amy started the original rent issue by refusing to communicate, neither handled it well and I was upset with both of them.  I went off to call a friend and vent. Fred came up to me and insisted I go sit with him or he was going to leave and take the car with him, leaving Amy and I to find our own way home. He said he wouldn't tolerate being treated like this (a common feeling he has about Amy) and needed me to take a stand with him. I felt like he was putting me between a rock and a hard place. I told him explicitly, repeatedly, that I agreed with him, side with him, know it's wrong, and just don't agree with his actions handling it after the fact. I think he felt betrayed and like I wasn't taking his side.  I was able to convince him to leave me the car because I felt that was kind of rude, and he went home on his own. Now he isn't speaking to me and is extremely upset-- more than usual, and I'm wondering if I read the whole situation wrong.

21,AITA for being upset that someone is naming their kid after my recently deceased father?,"AITA?   My dad died this past May after an extremely long battle with lung disease, a lung transplant, and the complications of the transplant (he died almost 2 years after receiving the transplant). There was a lot of suffering, both mentally and physically, experienced by my dad of course but also my mom/sisters/myself. I won’t go into detail, but the last two years have been extremely challenging for us all.  My dad had a sister, and they are estranged. I could not recognize her passing in the street, and they have probably spoken less than 5-10 times in the 30 years I’ve been alive. His sister has two kids, a son and daughter, both older than I am. The only time the son has ’shown’ up in our lives is when he called our house to ask my dad for money. Writing this post, I can’t even remember what his name is. The daughter friended me on Facebook years ago and did occasionally ask me how my dad was when he was at his sickest (mostly to share with her mom). My dad’s sister, her daughter, and her daughter’s kids showed up to my older sister’s wedding in 2013 - they sat in the car during the outdoor ceremony (the weather was beautiful) and left immediately after. That was the first/last time we saw them, and the first/last time my parents saw the little kids. They did not come to my wedding. (We invited them out of respect and not wanting to exclude any of my dad’s few relatives).  Tonight, the daughter messaged me on Facebook to tell me that her daughter is having another baby boy, and that the baby’s middle name will be my dad’s first name. I’m devastated. We would not recognize these people passing in the street. My dad would recognize his sister, but not his niece/her kids. They have had nothing to do with us and vice versa. Aside from the wedding, the only contact they’ve made is when asking for money or gifts. They didn’t send a card when he died, much less call. My older sister thinks this is a roundabout way to get us to send money/gifts to them, but I wouldn’t give them that much credit IMO.  I replied to her message with “That is an interesting choice to make, seeing as how my dad does not know you or your children and vice versa.” She has not seen/responded.  I realize I can’t force them to change the name, but IMO it’s ridiculous/bizarre to name a whole ass child after someone you do not know and who meant nothing to you, and disrespectful/clueless to message me and tell me as if I should be happy about this.

22,AITA for not wanting to pay for the repair of my friend's Macbook?,"AITA for not wanting to pay for the repair of my friend's Macbook? It was a friday night, I had arranged to meet up with a group of friends. We were going to drink and have fun playing some games after a stressful week of college tests. I organized everything to receive them and prepared myself to be a good hostess, I was taught hospitality and to always make sure that the guests were comfortable. Anyway, everyone arrived, we started to eat and talk, until one of the friends gave us the idea to move the furniture from the living room to play with VR, we were going to take turns and watch all of us playing a horror game in VR and laugh at the situation. I started removing the furniture from the living room, there weren't that many, so I asked them to just wait, the help really wasn't needed. Until it was time to carry an old armchair, it was heavier than other furniture, so my sister who lives with me helped me carry it, but I hadn't noticed that there underneath a backpack and a jacket on the armchair there was a Mac. Unfortunately, the accident happened, at a certain moment we tilted the chair too much and everything fell down and the Mac broke. (It doesn't change the situation, but both of us were sober) I was shocked by the situation, so was the owner of the notebook (she is one of my closest friends in the group). The atmosphere became tense, because she was very upset. At the end of the night, after everyone had left, by messages, we were deciding on the prices and how we were going to solve the problem. The next day, I was told about private conversations of other colleagues talking about this situation in which I was called a jerk for not offering to pay for the repair entirely. Until then it was just an unpleasant situation that could be solved quickly, but some people in the group decided to get involved and give their opinions. The only thing I could think of to defend myself in this situation is that the Macbook was in the wrong place, where anyone could sit, totally unprotected without a protective cover or inside the backpack. But I accept the view that I might be wrong, as I could have checked the situation better and taken the objects off the armchair before moving it. Maybe I should be more aware of people and their objects in my home, or maybe people should take care of their personal objects in environments that are not their home, I really don't know, I don't have an opinion. We are still sorting out the financial part, for now we have decided to split expenses in half, but some friends of hers have convinced her that I should take over all the expenses, making the conversation uncomfortable and a bit awkward. This situation is being a bit stressful and creating intrigue with a friend that I wouldn't want to lose.

26,AITA for paying my cousins back for a gift for me?,"So recently, I (19M) went to Malaysia to visit my extended family there. We were close growing up and have still been close until now but I haven't been able to see them for over 3 years because of the travel ban.  Anyways, while I was there, I bought one of my cousins (he was the youngest of five and since the economy there is quite bad, he had mainly only gotten hand-me-downs) a pair of Air Jordans for RM 800 (approx USD$169) and a few days later, when I was about to fly back home, his older siblings wanted to buy me gifts on my way back.  I insisted no and said there is no need for them to buy me anything as I had a great time there and I cannot accept gifts from them considering the horrible conversion rate they were receiving, anything for me would be too expensive for them (USD$1 = 4.73 RM). But they had actually bought a bunch of clothes and accessories for me while we were out in secret and somehow snuck them all in my luggage and I only found out about them when I got home.  There wasn't a receipt either but when I tallied everything up based on estimation, I estimated that they had given me RM 1000 worth of gift. I know they're financially stable. But when I thought about it, while those gifts are about USD$200 for me, they're easily spending RM 1000 and I just felt bad accepting it so I PayPal'ed their eldest sibling for the gifts and thanked them but said I couldn't accept it since it was a lot coming from them.  He ended up texting me back saying I was an AH for rejecting their good intentions and for ""indirectly calling them poor"" when that wasn't my intention at all.

27,AITA for humiliating MIL at a family dinner when she wouldn't stop going on about grandchildren?,"Please don't post this elsewhere (aka tiktok, YouTube).  I (27f) haven't gotten along with my MIL for the better part of my relationship with my partner (27m). She has said a lot of mean things about me that are honestly just childish and cruel (I won't get into the he said she said stuff). I've become exhausted with her, especially as I've moved into my career, moved town and am in the process of getting married/ buying a house. In the past few years shes taken to outright ignoring me, speaking over me, pretending i dont exist. As a result, I've mentally checked out from trying to make things working with her and in part so has my partner. Let me make it clear, I support whatever relationship he wants to have with her, but I'm done trying to be her friend.   We were at a family dinner party (my partner asked me to come along) recently where she started asking him about when he's having children. She kept pestering him and asking when she's getting grand babies and that she wants children around. This has been something shes been harping on a lot about lately and its getting on my nerves. My partner asked her to stop several times but she kept bringing it up. I was sat there silent for a bit, but I think the wine got the best of me so I kinda snapped. I turned to her and started asking what she wants to know about our *private* life?? What kind of protection we're using, what positions we've tried, what toys we use. I started to list them all. Lets just say I used very inappropriate language for a dinner table, even throwing in a ""do you have any pointers for me, or maybe it'd be best if you just came and watched to make sure we're doing it right"". At this point she was yelling at me, having a go at my partner for ""letting"" me speak to her like that and crying about how mean I am. We got up shortly after and left.    My partner thinks I took it a bit far in front of his family, and his aunties have said it was wildly uncalled for and mean. I don't really feel bad for it though, should I?  AITA?  ETA: I'm infertile. She isn't aware of this, I'd never give her that info to weaponise against me. But just for the people commenting to keep kids away from her, I won't have any to keep away from her but thank you for the advice. I know your hearts in the right place.  My partner has told her several times we won't be having children and to drop it. Since my partner always wanted children, she's assumed that I simply don't want children and am taking that away from him.  UPDATE:  Thank you all for the replies! I appreciate the people giving some reasoning behind YTA and ESH. I normally go to my friends about these things but I worry it's maybe a bit of an echo chamber, they're so supportive and might not call me out on my BS. I can say I've read most, if not all the replies, and I still don't feel that bad about what I said (sorry YTA and ESH people!).   MIL has since messaged my partner, I won't put the exact wording. But she has said that she ""knows"" I'm the cause of her not having grandchildren and she's disappointed in him for being with me. She also said how grandchildren are a basic right, and even if they are half carrot_sloth89's children, she would still find it in her heart to love them and shape them into good people.   My partner blocked her after that. I know a few people suggested I just tell her I'm infertile, but the way she weaponises information is honestly terrifying. Some other people said that my partner should say he is infertile, and I think that's a valid option, but for now he wants no contact.   Some people have suggested adoption. Thank you, I know it's coming from a good place, I just want to wait a while before considering children. I don't want to bring in a child that will likely have considerable trauma themselves into a house where I haven't fully healed. It's not fair on them. I'd also never want them to think they're filling a void just because we couldn't have children naturally, that's a heavy burden to place on a tiny person. I also think I'd like to do some pre-adoption therapy (if that's a thing lol) for a year or maybe even some classes to better educate myself on how best to adopt and raise an adopted child.

28,AITA for wanting to bring a nerf gun during trick or treating?,"So I'm a 21 F and I absolutely love Halloween, I try to spend as much time as I can when it comes to my costumes, mostly the props since sewing is too advanced for me, and this year I decided to be a triangle guard from squid game because ever since it came out last year I had wanted to be a character from it because I love the show.  Now, I'm too old to go trick or treating by myself without it seeming questionable but I have some step siblings, the oldest of them is married with a kid in middle school and they're not from the country so they never really got to go trick or treating and I wanted to give the kid a fun experience. Now back to the matter at hand, as the triangle guard, they're known to be the ones with the weapons and they eliminate the rule breakers or the players who fail their task, that's literally their job, so I wanted to be more into the role of the character and I got a nerf gun, the model is the Fortnite BASR-L Bolt Action that I spray painted black and have added some pink, logos, symbols, even a quote from the show on it. However, my stepdad says that if I bring it with trick or treating, I'll be putting his grandkid in danger because it looks too much like a real gun. Well, its supposed to look like a gun first of all, second, I've customized it and I doubt anyone will see a squid game soldier with a black and pink gun with paper logos taped onto it threatening. My mom takes his side like always and she tells me I need to leave it.  Here's the thing, I'm currently jobless without any income because I was in the hospital 3 different times from emotional distress, I wont go into detail because this post is long enough, and this gun with the supplies costed over $40 and I have very little money but I wanted this Halloween to be just as fun as my other ones with my costumes but this $40 is a lot of money to me with no income, since it was already painted, I can't return it and it's basically $40 completely wasted.  I've asked my step sister and she says it's fine and her husband is actually encouraging me to bring it, I've told a friend and she says that I'm in the right to be upset and that I'm old enough and I don't need to be told what to do by my parents. But I want to see what other people will think, maybe I'm in the wrong and if I am, I need help understanding why. So, am I the asshole if I bring a nerf gun trick or treating?  Also the area we live in is mostly LDS families and college students, so It's not like there's sketchy activity or anything like that.  Edit: Just from the few comments from the last few minutes alone have helped me see why its a bad idea, I'm going to leave the gun at home and I'm going to apologize to my mom and step-dad for thinking their concerns were invalid.

30,AITA for getting myself water from behind the bar?,"I was at a pub for an evening with friends. It's a two level establishment, with a quiet section upstairs that we're at.

I've been here before and they've sometimes had a ""help yourself"" water jug and glasses on the bar in the past, though this wasn't the case tonight.  I don't drink, but I ordered an appetizer and water. My appetizer comes in decent time, but then the waiter disappears.  Over an hour later, no water has arrived for me (though two friends who ordered a drink and water had their water arrive). My group hasn't ordered another round in a while and I realize there's no server in sight.  I'm really thirsty by now, so I get up and and look for water. There's a bar upstairs, but the server is nowhere in sight. The whole floor has been left unattended; presumably our server is downstairs.  I assume they're busy and look for a water glass and jug. No dice. But there is the bar tap (no barrier or sign in the way). I go behind the bar and fill up a glass with water. Sit back down, drink it. A few minutes later I've drained my glass and want more water. Still no server in sight, so I go behind the bar again and fill my glass with water.  Just then the server reappears up the stairs, and they are livid when they see me behind the bar.

I explain that my water never arrived, and I didn't see her anywhere so I thought to fill my glass up myself. The server says they did in fact serve my water, and points to a friend's water. The friend says it's theirs as the server storms off, making a point of shutting the (previously unseen and unused) half-door thingy into the bar. They avoid my table for the rest of the evening, and when I settle the bill I apologize. I get another dressing down, making the table quite awkward.

When their brother eventually got a condo, OP felt like they had taken it too far and regretted their decision, but they were justified in being cautious given their brother's past behavior.",'AITA for Telling My Brother to Rent a Place Instead of Moving Back Home?'
32,AITA for not responding after being treated badly this weekend?,I(21F) have small friend group. One of the girls in the group is under 21 so it hard for us to go to bars/clubs without making her feel left out. On the 29th one of my favorite bars was doing a Halloween event that seemed like fun. So I suggested that on Friday we would go to house parties so everyone could go together then on Saturday we would go to the bars It seemed like a win win.   leading up to Halloweekend I noticed that a party flyer was going around. It was a party hosted by the girl who is under 21. I only found out about the party because I seen the flyer posted on someone instagram story. Nobody told me about it.    On the 27th I asked the group what was the plan for Saturday. I gave them the opportunity to bring up the party but nothing. Later that night I got left alone with the party host girl. She was talking about the party and I said I didn’t know if I’m  are going cause Im going to the bars. She said I should stop by and insisted I go.   28th we were supposed to start at 8 I called them and they were still getting ready. 8 turn to 9 then 9 turn to 10 and I got no updates so I called again. I felt so embarrassed. When 11 hit I decided to go out somewhere else until they were ready. I only stayed for 30 minutes when they finally said they were ready and sent me the address to meet them. we were 3 hours late so it didn’t seem to be still going. My friend was already drunk and the girls in the group were openly judging her. I helped her then I came back to the group and they started talking about the plans for the 29th. They said “so we were thinking we could come for two hours then leave and go to her party”  weren’t including me in the plans. It seems like they already had this plan set and weren’t asking me they were telling me what was going to happen. I felt so excluded so I just left.   29th hit I didn’t hear from anyone. They called my friend but not me to talk about the plans. Still excluding us from the house party plans. They didn't message me once which was weird. My friend from home got uncomfortable being the middle man so she lied to text me. They didn’t text me until two hours before the bar event started Saying that one didn’t get a ticket yet and someone else wanted to go but didn’t know if they were still selling tickets. Excuses.   When it was time to go they said to go without them because they were still getting ready. I told them no rush because but they insisted on riding separately. I asked them later if they were there yet and she told me they weren’t going and that they were at the house party.  The 30th they called me and I didn’t pick up I was still pissed and hangover. I had a good night still but it made me mad had they was still acting like everything was fine.   So AITA if I never speak to them again?,ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Post: I(21F) have small friend group.

33,AITA for refusing to get a 'real' job?,"I, 19F still live with my parents and this has been a long time issue with them. I currently  work on a horse farm as a working student. I get paid $12/hr with free riding lessons and I get paid under the table. I love my job and though it's hard work, it's enjoyable and something that works well for me because I have ADHD. Despite how much I love my job, my parents think it's a waste because the state doesn't recognize me as being employed, therfore my dad says I don't have a real job and I need to get one.

I wish I could go back to school as I aim to be a livestock vet, but due to untreated(Only in the past month have I started treatment) ADHD and the pandemic, I'm mentally unable to do it at the moment. My parents have been pressuring me since I started doing bad in college to just try harder and do more classes even when I'm doing my best. My parents are constantly  making off hand comments  in reply to things I say. For example, I may express interest  in a horse related topic and my mom may reply 'Or  you could be spending your type applying to college' and my dad would chip in 'Or apply and get a real job'.. this has been going on for MONTHS.  At the beginning  of September  we got into a big argument  where I tried to explain my side and how I mentally cannot handle going to college right now even though it would be my dream. How I love my job and even if I get paid less, the people are amazing, It's a job I know I can handle, and I gain valuable  experience  through riding other people's horses outside my own. I refused to listen to their advice and because of it, I was told that I was ""Looking for a roommate situation"" and not to be a part or this family, and thus I would be required to pay rent.      Tomorrow  marks month 2 of paying  rent, and up until Yesterday, I thought I was justified with my decision to stay with the job I have until my family was hanging out with family friends.

35,AITA for not relenting about organization in shared spaces of our new apartment and driving one of my roommates to possibly move out?," So I 21f recently moved into an apartment with two of my friends who we’ll call Lola 21f and Abby 19f. Lola and I have been living together for two years but Abby was a new addition. I’ve known Abby since high school but we weren’t exactly close friends during that time. In the last year we have been hanging out more and more and have gotten closer. So we all decided to get our first apartment near our college campus together.  Something to understand about me is that I have intense OCD tendencies due to trauma that I experienced both from my parents and from another incident a year and a half ago. I am currently trying to work on it with my therapist but it's a struggle. Both my roommates knew of this before we moved in. Lola doesn’t have a problem with me having control of the organization since it keeps everything nice and clean. Abby, despite saying it was alright, has fought me on everything since day one.  She has been unwilling to compromise in many situations and caused a lot of stress and anxiety for Lola and I. It doesn’t help that Abby and my dad are incredibly close and really good friends. He even takes her side on many of the issues and has teamed up with her on occasion to try and prove Lola and I wrong. I have been feeling very trapped in this situation since she’s always over at my parents house and my dad will usually reprimand me for not “allowing” Abby something when all I’ve ever tried to do is compromise for both of our comfort.  I understand that living with someone with OCD can be very challenging but I have tried so many different things to allow us both comfortable living. Recently, we had our biggest disagreement yet and it was when she put her groceries out and above the cabinets despite there being a free bin for her to use so that the groceries don’t show. It really bothers me and causes me anxiety. I bought her the bin to try and help but she says it's too hard to use. I tried to compromise and move my stuff to a higher cabinet so she could take the easier to reach cabinet but she basically said that if she can’t use the space normally then she will move back in with her parents and not pay utilities. This caused me to have a breakdown in the kitchen that Lola had to talk me down from. I’m now losing sleep over the issue because I know that something isn’t right in the home and I’ve had constant overwhelming anxiety ever since. My hands also shake now as a result.  I want her to be comfortable in her home since it is a shared living space but I also believe everyone should be comfortable.

36,AITA for not going to my girlfriends sons funeral?,"I (28m) have been dating my girlfriend  (30f) for 2 months. I think we had a good relationship, she has a son (11m). My girlfriend and I were good friends for a few years, we met through a mutual friends and so I haven’t spent time with her alone until 5 months ago.  I knew she had a son, because she’s posted about him on Facebook, a few times. He has some sort of liver condition and was awaiting a liver transplant. its just him and his mom. I don’t know much about him, as my gf Is very reserved talking about her son.  I have a little sister (26f). I have always been closer to her than other siblings, considering we’re only a few years apart.  when she was 11, we were fighting at school and she ended up fainting. She had to stay in the hospital for a few days to have some tests done, and she ended up being diagnosed with diabetes, not related to her death.   I think it changed the dynamic of our relationship a lot, because she was in hospital a lot more than other kids.  At the start of September, my gfs son started getting sicker, and it was the first time she ever opened up to me about his health conditions.  In early October my  sister got into an accident. It was very sudden, and because she still lives near my parents they were heartbroken, and they don’t have any children apart from my sister and I, so I went to help them.  I Grew up in Australia, and my sister and my family still live there, I live in America currently. For the funeral and to console my mum and dad, I decided to stay there for 10days to help plan the funeral.  On my second day there, I got a call from my gf. She said her son had passed away during the night, I tried to help her the best I could even though I was already sad about the death of my sister. She said she wanted the funeral to be done soon, and that it would happen on the 6th day of my ten day trip. My sisters funeral was on the 8th and I wasn’t going to take two flights to there and two flights back in less than 2 days to go to both.  My gf got really upset, and said that I didn’t care about her son, and I was upset at her too becuase i had just lost my sister. She told me that her son thought of me like a dad, and I’d never met him so I told her I didn’t think of him like a son. She hung up angrily and we haven’t spoken since.  I’ll admit I was harsh telling her, and a grieving mother didn’t deserve that, however I don’t think I was wrong to push the idea of me being this kids dad.  All my mutual friends think I’m the A-hole for not going, and that I should’ve told her later, but she knows I’ve never met her son, and I wouldn’t ditch my sisters funeral to go to her sons. My friends though think I did the right thing and I wasn’t obligated to go to his funeral.  I don’t know what I should’ve done, I’m glad I went to my sisters funeral but I feel bad for how I told my gf as her sons never had a father figure in his life.  Edit: thank you all for these kind words, I’m very glad for all the support on this. I have read lots of comment before, however I’ve been waiting to give you an update on my and my gf.  My gf and I aren’t together anymore, I’ve cut ties with her, not out of spite as some of the earlier comments said, but because I don’t think seither of us are ready, we are both grieving important people in our lives now.   I have heard from a freind of a freind(also a mutual freind who’s not that close) who’s friends with my ex gf she is still very upset and angry at me for my comment that ‘he’s not my son’ and so I haven’t spoken to a lot of my more distant mutual friends. A lot of them have been friends with my ex gf for years and have heard lots about her son, whereas not much about my sister as it was so sudden, so are still upset at me for not going, so I haven’t spoken to them much either.

39,WIBTA for blowing up on someone who fakes disorders,"Ok, I have a friend, let’s call her ally. Ally has an interesting personality. I don’t really have any major issues with her, other than the fact she fakes disorders. She tells people she has ocd and Tourette’s and will constantly make jokes about it. Her “tics” are usually not joking, ever 5 seconds, and like last for 10 seconds. In class? Their will be periods of time where she doesn’t tic for HOURS. If you ask about it, she gets very defensive and claims she doesn’t want to talk about it, however she generally talks about it all the time, making it a personality trait at this point. For the OCD, same case. Talks about it all the time. Today I asked her about what variation she has (for context I have been diagnosed with intrusive thoughts, ritualistic behavior ocd about 2 years ago) and she just said “ I don’t know, ocd?” I thought at first huh. Maybe she actually doesn’t know? But the more I think about it it sounds fake. I told her that people actually have issues with these disorders and that she shouldn’t be thinking it’s a cool thing to have. Her reply, “stop yelling at me your going to flare up my ocd”.

40,AITA For Wanting To Confront My Future Sister-In-Law,"I (27 F) recently had my bridal shower shower after getting engaged to my fiancé (27 M).

41,WIBTA if I confronted my dad about his cheating?,"Context: My (23m) parents have been divorced for a decade, and my dad remarried a couple years later. At the time, I voiced my disapproval of his new relationship, which led to him saying a lot of hurtful things. At their wedding (eight years ago at the time of writing), I discovered he had cheated on my mom with his now wife. I never confronted him about it because I'm convinced he wouldn't care about my feelings and say a bunch of hurtful things again.  I recently realized how holding onto this family secret has negatively affected my life and that it's finally time to confront him. I planned on have a private dinner where I would tell him what I know and ask him to confess to my siblings too, since I'm confident that I'm the only one of the three of us who knows. Where I fear I will be the asshole is that I plan on doing it before a family trip. It has come to my attention that we might be meeting my dad's wife's family on this trip, which is where I draw the line. I have managed to get away with not meeting them before, and I would like it to stay that way because I do not view his wife or her family as my family because of his cheating (I even refuse to call her my stepmom). A part of me is worried that this will cause me to have an outburst on the trip, which further cemented to me why it's time to have this secret out in the open, and that it should happen before we leave. I’m worried, however, that doing it before the trip will cause a lot of tension and am wondering whether if it is better until after the trip to have this conversation.

49,AITA for not letting my family adopt a pet?,"2 years ago my dog died, she was very important to me and I broke down when it happened. I'm currently 20yo and my 2 little sisters are 17 and 15 I still live with my parents and I plan to move in about 2 years. Few months after my dog died, my sister brought up the idea of bringing a new dog to the family, I strongly disagreed because I didn't want to replace my dog but the real reason is that seeing other pets just make me ferious. I don't know how to explain it but I used to like pets and since then I really try to avoid them, but having them in my house (for example when my sister takes care of her friend's dog for few days when they are on vacation) makes me really furious and I hold myself from bursting out. Its reaching the point where I try to avoid coming back to my own house when I know there is a pet there.  Until now my mom respected my disagreement and didn't bring a dog no matter how much my sisters begged. But now my sister started feeding a stray cat that wandered to our garden, she named him and let him in the house a little. Even my big brother (22yo) started liking him which makes me even more mad since he had absolutely no affection to my dog unlike my 2 sisters who loved her.  Now everytime I see this cat I hiss him away and don't let him in the house when he tries to enter. My entire family yells at me to stop it but I just can't. My sisters say they really want their own pet before they leave the house. So am I the asshole for ruining every chance they have of it? I hate it when they say they want their own pet because my dog was theirs too and they loved her.

About 4 years ago she met my now stepdad (Dave fake name) and about 2 years ago we moved in with him at his house. Dave has a brother (fake name will be John) that has been helping with projects around the house for the past 3-4 months. First it was remolding the master bath, then redoing the floors in some rooms. He fixed my leaky faucet which was amazing. It’s nice to have things fixed around the house. However this is where my mom and I start to have problems. John is still doing more projects. We thought he would be gone by now. He usually gets there at around 7-8 in the morning and stays until 5-6 working on things. So he does not stay over night, but my mom gets annoyed when he tries to insert himself into my mom and stepdads  relaxing time at the end of the day. Dave has no problems with John being there. It’s his house so he can have whoever he wants over. My mom just wants to have privacy which I agree with. I’m tired of having him sit around all the time (which he has started to do.) My mom is getting annoyed with him. We are thankful for all the help John has given us but I feel as though he needs to respect that my mom doesn’t want him over every day. It gets annoying when I wake up to drilling and hammering in the morning but by noon he just sits around and sometimes does some work. Dave gets mad anytime we say something about it. I’m not allowed to speak of it at all. My mom and I are just tired of having John over almost every day of the week.

It was around 7 in the afternoon when my mom texted me that John came over and just started sitting around on his IPad doing things. I told her that she needed to tell him to get out. He has no business being there. He didn’t leave until an hour passed I think. I was pissed but I can’t do anything. It’s Dave’s house technically, but it’s like my mom doesn’t even live there to him, it’s like she has no say so in her own privacy.

About 4 years ago she met my now stepdad (Dave fake name) and about 2 years ago we moved in with him at his house. Dave has a brother (fake name will be John) that has been helping with projects around the house for the past 3-4 months. First it was remolding the master bath, then redoing the floors in some rooms. He fixed my leaky faucet which was amazing. It’s nice to have things fixed around the house. However this is where my mom and I start to have problems. John is still doing more projects. We thought he would be gone by now. He usually gets there at around 7-8 in the morning and stays until 5-6 working on things. So he does not stay over night, but my mom gets annoyed when he tries to insert himself into my mom and stepdads  relaxing time at the end of the day. Dave has no problems with John being there. It’s his house so he can have whoever he wants over. My mom just wants to have privacy which I agree with. I’m tired of having him sit around all the time (which he has started to do.) My mom is getting annoyed with him. We are thankful for all the help John has given us but I feel as though he needs to respect that my mom doesn’t want him over every day. It gets annoying when I wake up to drilling and hammering in the morning but by noon he just sits around and sometimes does some work. Dave gets mad anytime we say something about it. I’m not allowed to speak of it at all. My mom and I are just tired of having John over almost every day of the week. What was my final straw was a couple days ago, my mom has never had a night to herself in 2-3 years. She constantly takes care of Dave who has back problems. This was the night she was happy about. It was around 7 in the afternoon when my mom texted me that John came over and just started sitting around on his IPad doing things. I told her that she needed to tell him to get out. He has no business being there. He didn’t leave until an hour passed I think. I was pissed but I can’t do anything. It’s Dave’s house technically, but it’s like my mom doesn’t even live there to him, it’s like she has no say so in her own privacy. I feel like the a-hole because it’s his house and family, but does he not respect that my mom and I want privacy?   So AITA for wanting my stepdad‘s brother to stop working on projects around the house and give us some privacy?  Edit: thank you to all who have replied so fast. I wanted to clarify some things. I do plan to move out soon I am trying to work to save money. My mom has expressed she doesn’t like him being around all the time. She has tried to tell Dave many times. John has helped with all the important things already, he is doing stuff like building things outside that we didn’t need now. He is at the house almost every day and most days he isn’t doing anything. My mom also pays for a least half of the bills and expenses is what she told me. She also buys all the groceries and does the cleaning. (It’s a big house) Dave has a 12 year old daughter that is over half the week and she eats everything.'}]","OP (19f) and her mom have been living with her stepdad (Dave) for 2 years. Dave's brother John has been helping with projects around the house for 3-4 months, but OP and her mom feel that he is overstepping his welcome and disrespecting their privacy. They feel that John should respect their boundaries and not be at the house every day, especially since they contribute financially to the household. However, Dave has no problem with John's presence and gets angry when they mention it. OP feels like the asshole for wanting John to stop coming over, but feels that they have a right to their own space and privacy in their own home.",'AITA for Wanting My Stepdad's Brother to Respect Our Boundaries in Our Own Home?'
53,AITA for buying new shoes instead of new laces?,"I (F22) have recently had my dog chew most of the way through the laces on my current set of shoes.

61,AITA for refusing to consider people who were not wearing costumes for a costume party?,"My organization on campus always hosts a huge Halloween party. I have been every year since I was a freshman and given that I am a senior this year it was my opportunity to help plan it.  I was asked to handle the costume contest. I was the head judge. The way it works is that all the other organizations choose one member of their group to submit for the best costume and we pick one male org and one female org member to win.  In past years, I have never particularly liked how the costumes were judged. The male costumes were always good, but the female costumes were just not great. They went with the typical girl Halloween costume. We always had some girls that show up in real costumes and not just string and a prop. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn’t be winning the costume contest.  So the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.  We looked at each contestant and we’re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.  This girl was in a Trixie Tang costume from Fairly Odd Parents. The other judge was not a fan of it so she did not want her to win. But all the other girls weren’t in costumes. We debated it before I said that I would just say whoever she said was the winner to get her to shut her mouth. This was a lie and when I announced the winner, I explicitly said that Trixie Tang won because she has the best actual costume of all of the lady entries.  The other judge was mad and the girls from the losing groups were not happy. They said I judged unfairly. The president of my org co-signed my decision and said that the outcome was fine. We awarded the prize and everything was cool, but after that, none of the girls from the orgs that lost wouldn’t talk to me. The other judge told me I was a dick and lied to her which I guess is true, but our house our rules and our près. Was cool with it.

In past years, I have never particularly liked how the costumes were judged. The male costumes were always good, but the female costumes were just not great. They went with the typical girl Halloween costume. We always had some girls that show up in real costumes and not just string and a prop. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn’t be winning the costume contest.  So the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.  We looked at each contestant and we’re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.  This girl was in a Trixie Tang costume from Fairly Odd Parents. The other judge was not a fan of it so she did not want her to win. But all the other girls weren’t in costumes. We debated it before I said that I would just say whoever she said was the winner to get her to shut her mouth. This was a lie and when I announced the winner, I explicitly said that Trixie Tang won because she has the best actual costume of all of the lady entries.  The other judge was mad and the girls from the losing groups were not happy. They said I judged unfairly. The president of my org co-signed my decision and said that the outcome was fine. We awarded the prize and everything was cool, but after that, none of the girls from the orgs that lost wouldn’t talk to me. The other judge told me I was a dick and lied to her which I guess is true, but our house our rules and our près. Was cool with it.

Although she claims she's doing this to help him, her true motives seem to be driven by her own self-interest, as she's been estranged from him due to his past actions. She visits him once to fulfill her end of the bargain, but then refuses to engage with him further, leading his wife to accuse her of being selfish and cheating her husband out of money.

For contexts sake I should mention that none of us are black or gay but we say N- or F- slurs pretty often.  One guy in the group has a history of telling us off for making jokes like these. One time last year one of the group members made a joke about his girlfriend that got him on his period or whatever and he left the group chat. We talked with him about it and his big issue was that he felt like we were bad people for cursing like that in the group chat. We told him we'd stop out of respect for him and we did, and he came back and joined the group. We've all been hanging out together since but I guess we fell back into the habit of making jokes like that again.

65,AITA for bringing up the past with someone who's sick?,"Two years ago, I was at the end of a professional training programme and one of my appraisals went very badly (I was essentially held back due to a lack of progression - those good at math may be able to link this timing to a global health problem where disruption could have impacted on my training goals).  One of the appraisers made a very personal comment about me and my lack of progression to the others on the team - which was then repeated back to me (seemingly by mistake?). It was highly insulting and I was very concerned about the reputational damage that could be caused from such a comment - but I was a trainee and not in a position to challenge it. I don't think that the person who made the comment ever found out that I was told what she had said.  In the end, I managed to finish my training. I recently reached out to the person who made the comment and they were very happy to hear from me (I think they thought I wanted to catch up). But I asked them about what they said and what really did they mean by it. They immediately distanced themselves from the comment and talked about they had retired and were unwell, but that I was a good worker and that they hoped their response was satisfactory.  I responded that it wasn't. That the comment was given to me as part of formal feedback but that they had failed to address it in their email. I just got back an email saying that due to their health concerns and the fact that it's been two years, that they can't help me.  I'm not going to push further - I don't know what the health problems are but I do feel guilty for pushing this on someone unwell.

So, AITA for not leaving well enough alone and bothering someone old and sick for something they said years ago.

71,AITA For wanting to take in a cat when my roommate doesn’t want one,"To give some backstory, my girlfriend and her family had two cats. A couple of years ago, a family friend of hers essentially kidnapped the cat and kept it in their house. Fast forward to now, the cat is no longer allowed in said family friends house and my girlfriends family won’t take it back in. My girlfriend and I thought about taking the cat to my place. I live in a very large bedroom that has its own washroom (The bedroom is the size of a large living room). I live with three other people and the other two have agreed to take in the cat. However, one of my roommates does not want the cat. He doesn’t like cats, doesn’t want it running around the house, and doesn’t want hair everywhere. I tried explaining to him that the cat would be in my room and it would be as if there was no cat in the house. He was initially upset about it, but later reluctantly agreed to taking in the cat for a week. If the cat was around the house too much, I would give it back.

72,AITA for asking my boyfriend to let me know when he leaves our vacation rental?,"My boyfriend (39) and I (24F) were on a vacation to a mountaintop resort, because I have never seen the ‘leaf’ season and was excited to see everything on our two-night trip.  After arriving late af (3am) due to a number of factors, we stayed up until 5am. Even though I worked 7 hours and my boyfriend was off, I drove his new Tesla (a car I am less confident driving than my car) so I’m exhausted.  We decided at 5am to go to bed until around 7am, so that we could see the sunrise from the balcony, and then sleep in. We get in bed and he pulls out a book while I fall asleep. I am a deep sleeper while my boyfriend is not.  At 7am I am awoken to see the sunrise, it is gorgeous and while I am normally grumpy upon waking up, I thank my boyfriend for waking me before going back to bed.  At 9:30am I wake up alone, and call his name. Hearing no answer, I call out again. Call it anxiety or trust issues (he is still in the process of earning my trust back, not because of explicit cheating but because of old messaging with my coworker, and my ex left me with trust issues that I have {proudly} 80% overcome, set back by my boyfriend’s actions with others) my mind begins to panic.  I get out of bed, walk into the doorway of the living room and am hit by the volume of the vent fan (a noise he uses to sleep). I shout his name, before seeing him sit up from the couch in the living room. (He apparently never really went to sleep once I did at 5am, he woke me up at 7am and then did work stuff on his laptop until I woke up.)  He is instantly mad at me for yelling at him, and in my panicked, just-woke-up stupor (did I mention I CAN be an admitted bitch for 5-10 minutes after I wake up), I mirrored his anger and yelled that I was just worried about where he was. He, as a 39-year-old, private-schooled, only-child man, doesn’t like to be told what to do. So he countered with something along the lines of, “so what if I had gone to get coffee for us? Or breakfast? Would you be mad then?”   Honestly, yes. Because  A. He left me in a condo complex while he took our only car, and  B. He would’ve driven down the mountain, with spectacular views that I had driven through the night before and couldn’t look at (I could tell by the sky and the lights of houses that the view was pretty damn nice but I was driving up a curvy mountain and it was 3am) without me, while he “let me sleep*”  *I am relatively easy to wake up, and I told him that all he could’ve woken me and told me he was leaving, and then if I chose to sleep I would do so in peace.

75,AITA for giving my husband the green light to accept his mom's lavish gifts when she gives our children shitty ones?,"My MIL is a very difficult woman. She has struggled a lot with the transition of her kids having kids, as she only views her family as her husband and kids, and does not like ""having a grandmother role forced on her"" When my oldest was born I was naive and thought MIL would help out. I learned that the hard way. She didn't want to do family holidays and just wanted to be alone with her husband, stopped doing family vacations. Honestly I thought it was just because she doesn't like me, but she loves her son in law and isn't any more interested in their children.  I will admit this hurt me and I set pretty harsh boundaries. One of the boundaries was that my husband could not accept gifts from MIL. She would always get him really nice birthday and Christmas gifts and get our kids cheap impersonal junk. MIL's gifts to him were always experiences or hobby related things as he grew up wealthy but does not make the kind of money he grew up with, and she feels he doesn't treat himself enough. Six years ago we told MIL that he would no longer be accepting these gifts as he is a husband and father first, and it isn't right.  Well my husband has been struggling with some depression lately. One of his biggest things is he feels like he is just a husband and father and lost his identity. He feels he gives constantly and gets very little back. I hate seeing him like this, so I called MIL and asked if she wanted to resume giving him gifts and said I would no longer stand in the way.  Well he had a birthday recently and MIL bought him something for his hobby (probably a $10,000-12,000 bike according to the internet) and gave him some gift cards so he could take a weekend away to his favorite trails. I could see how much it meant to him and felt I made the right decision, but my daughter blew up.  She said I was being unfair to her by allowing MIL to flaunt how selfish she is, and that he should stand strong and say there will be no gifts until she can buy gifts for the family. She said she was disappointed in my lack of a backbone and disappointed in her dad.

Friend doesn’t know the man he connected with is married to me, just that he’s in an open relationship.  I think my husband should tell Friend the social connection before they meet up, he disagrees. Wibta for outing this secret to Friend? Does Friend need to know given the purely sexual future encounter?'}]","The OP and her husband are in an open relationship, and they're planning a purely sexual encounter with an old friend from high school. The friend doesn't know about the husband's marital status, and the OP thinks he should be told before they meet up. However, the husband disagrees, and the OP is wondering if she's being unreasonable by expecting him to disclose this information. The key point is that the relationship is open, and the encounter is purely sexual, so it's not necessary to disclose the husband's marital status to the friend.",AITA for Thinking My Husband Should Tell Our Friend About Being Married in an Open Relationship?

85,AITA for pranking my brother,"The title is really oversimplified, just a heads up.   I (M18) have spent the past three ish years living with my dad's ex (lets call her Jane) (she's not my mom, her and my dad were together way before I was born) because I was pretty sick ahd her family's incredibly rich and has like a million doctors so they could give me better access to better treatment. The original plan was that I would just go with her family and my dad would join me afterwards once he got work stuff sorted, but the pandemic  got in the way and made it harder for my dad to join me afterwards since I am immunocompromised and he wasn't in a position to be isolated with me. I'd rather not go too much into the specifics of it all but what you need to know is that I hadn't seen my dad in person for over a year before this week.  During the period of time that I was gone, my dad took in a different kid (M16) since he's registered as a foster parent. Since then, he's adopted the kid. And I had a lot of differing emotions over it when I first found out, and also a lot of time to sit with them. I've spoken to him over the phone a couple of times, but never in person.    Anyways, I got the news that I would finally be able to go home a little while ago, and decided that I would surprise my dad (and new brother) with it.

87,AITA for taking my daughters “emotional support” dog back to the shelter?,"My daughter is 17. I’m 47. My wife is 44. My daughter had been having problems with her anxiety and depression, school had been very hard for her and she asked us if she could get an animal for “emotional support”. I asked her why we couldn’t just put her in regular therapy again but she said she didn’t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn’t want to try it again.  I was pretty against bringing an animal into the home as my daughter can barely keep her room clean and remember to wash her dishes, much less take care of an animal. And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog because I work long hours and didn’t want to be picking up messes when I got home. My wife said I was being unfair and that this could be what my daughter needed to get back in good spirits.  So we got her a dog. We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care (such as frequent grooming and other traits) and I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference.   The dog was great at first and it got along with my daughter and wife greatly. Me not so much, but it could probably sense I didn’t really like it either. But then it started getting out of its leash on walks, tearing up the couch and various other toys we bought it. My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I’d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet.   I warned her twice that if she didn’t start taking responsibility that the dog would be going back and she gave me excuses saying she was feeling depressed again. She said she would do better, but didn’t. Ultimately, I got fed up so one day when she went to school I loaded the dog in my truck and told the shelter he wasn’t a good fit for us.  Obviously when she came home she was upset. She was saying the dog was her best friend but I told her that she wasn’t taking very good care of him, and he didn’t deserve that.

She said she would do better, but didn’t. Ultimately, I got fed up so one day when she went to school I loaded the dog in my truck and told the shelter he wasn’t a good fit for us.  Obviously when she came home she was upset. She was saying the dog was her best friend but I told her that she wasn’t taking very good care of him, and he didn’t deserve that. Wife says it was very harsh to just take the dog back while she was gone, but she agrees daughter wasn’t responsible. My daughter has been saying I brought back her severe depression and we haven’t been talking.

Despite initial reservations, the OP and his wife agreed to get a dog, but it quickly became a source of stress due to the daughter's lack of responsibility. After repeated warnings, the OP took the dog back to the shelter while the daughter was at school, citing the dog's poor condition and the daughter's failure to take care of it. The daughter is now blaming the OP for bringing back her depression, and the OP is wondering if he was the asshole for taking the dog back.",'AITA for Taking Away My Daughter's Emotional Support Dog Due to Her Lack of Responsibility?'

Recently I had two shitty nights and every time I've come back there's been 5+ people in my room past 11 pm. Yesterday after they cleared out I asked my roommate to not host so many especially when she is aware I'll be coming back. She said okay and went to join her friends in the hall.  My boyfriend(18M)stayed in my room late that night to comfort me.

After he left she said she wanted to talk. She told me, whenever me and him cuddle, dance while we talk (a weird thing we do), or just show PDA to each other it makes her uncomfortable. She said she's not sure if it's due to her being aro-ace. Also saying that she doesn't want him over as often, he's normally over 5-6 times a week. While she either has her friends in our room for similar amounts of time (alittle less) or stands with our door open talking to them, whenever I'm trying to sleep.

However whenever they’re at her house she never does anything for them. She doesn’t make them food, doesn’t look after them, and is generally just happy holding them or playing with them for a bit. Of course this is okay with us, and we are more than happy fixing them a quick snack or making sure they’re well. But lately she’s been calling me and Mark nonstop begging us to drop the kids at her place overnight. She says she misses spending ‘real’ quality time with them, and keeps saying I refuse to let her see them more than once a week. We tried to explain that with us being two hours away and the kids being a handful (they’re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her. She still insisted but we ended up saying no. She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn’t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only.   Into the issue. After saying goodbye to the kids Mark took me to a fancy restaurant halfway across town. He said that since the kids will be at their grandma’s place we can finally have quality time. I agreed and half an hour into our evening we got a call from MIL. I was afraid at first but she said nothing happened, she just asked when will we back. I replied that we will pick up the kids at 9 am the next day, and she immediately got upset. She said she couldn’t handle the kids and they kept demanding food, that she play with them, or straight up saying they want their cousins over. We tried telling her we are busy and at best will come over in a few hours, but she refused. She said she, and those are her exact words, “had her fill with the children and never expected such trouble”. I told her that was normal behaviour for kids their age and she started yelling at me on the phone. Mark ended up taking the phone and told her we will be over at 9 the next morning. Then he ended the call and we ended up going back to our date.   Next morning we showed up at 9 exactly. Our kids were happy to see us but my MIL refused to speak to either of us. When Mark tried joking with her she screamed at him that we trapped her with our kids and that we were irresponsible and cruel. I reminded her she was the one who kept insisting we do this and she said she changed her mind and we could’ve taken the kids with us and gone home. She’s now telling family that we dropped the kids off at her house and refused to come pick them up and that I was super rude. I’ve gotten several messages saying I should be a better DIL. AITA?

94,AITA For not wanting my cat to be called ‘SuperDog’?,"A lighthearted and really low stakes post, but we said we’d throw it out to Reddit to decide:  My partner (35M) and I (33F) have been picked as the adopters of two cats pending final checks (YAY!) but we are having a disagreement about names as he wants to make one of them ‘SuperDog’ (we have agreed on the other name).

95,WIBTA for asking my friend (21f) and her roommate/friends to not smoke weed while I'm (20f) at her apt?,"My friend Carly (21f) and I (20f) have been friends for \~8yrs and we go to different colleges in the same city. She lives abt 30min away and it's not easy to hang out often in person. Bc of this, I had no idea she'd started smoking weed regularly til she mentioned it this summer.  Last night, I was invited over to watch a movie. I agreed. I assumed we would be going out to see it in the theater, but it wasn't until we were almost at her apt that I was told we were watching a movie at her apt instead. And also that her roommate and his friend would be there too. When I got to her apt (which is small and has only one window), I was hit with the strong smell of weed. I didn't mention it bc it's none of my business and people smoke all the time in the city. I also figured she was noseblind to it and felt it would be rude/embarrassing to bring it up since there wasn't much she could do.  During the movie, her roommate and his friend each took a hit from a homemade gravity bong they'd recently made. They didn't go out onto the fire escape and the smell was strong. This was the first time I met them and no one else was bothered, so I didn't feel like I could complain. It'd been abt 2.5hrs and had a pounding headache. Carly excitedly showed me the bong and wanted me to get close to watch, but I said the smell was giving me a headache, hoping she'd get the hint. She nodded but didn't seem to fully get it. She sat inside to hit it on the windowsill, but bc of how the bong was made, a lot of smoke leaked into the apt and I had to go sit down, dizzy and overwhelmed. This was the first time I'd been exposed to the smoke for a long time and found out it made me feel like shit.  The bong was hit 3 more times when I was there and for the rest of the night, I felt awful. I had a headache, stomachache, and even though I showered when I got home, it felt like the smell was stuck in my nose, which was nauseating. This morning was the same, plus my heart was pounding, my brain felt really slow, and I was extra anxious for no reason.  I want to be able to prevent this in the future and keep hanging out with Carly. I'm worried that by asking her not to smoke when I'm there, it'll sound like I'm judging her for smoking at all, since I don't smoke or drink (a personal choice, that makes me the ""token straight-edge"" according to her friends).

96,AITA for not Photoshopping my Stillborn Aunt into a Family Photo?,"There's a little known fact in my family (at least among the cousins and grandkids), that one of my aunts, Aunt Ann, was supposed to be a twin, but her twin sister was stillborn. It's not exactly a taboo topic or anything, just some random trivia that never has any reason to come up in conversation.  One day, I was visiting my Grandma, and showing her how I was using Photoshop for one of my school projects. She seemed really interested, got quiet for moment, and then got up and pulled a small diary out of her closet. She started talking, and to my surprise, I learned that she had named her lost baby, Sophia Rose. Every year she would write a birthday message in the diary, just to remember her. She had never told anybody all these years, because back then, that sort of thing just wasn't talked about. But now she wondered if there were any way I could photoshop another picture of Aunt Ann into her favorite family picture, so it looked like her twin was there. She had always wondered what it would've looked like with her family completed.  I, of course, was quite willing to do it. My Aunt Ann was having lunch with my mother and I a few days later, and I thought I'd run the idea by her then and ask her if she had a nice picture I could use.  But, to my surprise, both my mom and Aunt Ann were horrified with the idea. Aunt Ann especially said she didn't want it done, that using her picture for a dead person was morbid and creeped her out. It would be her face representing a ghost. Plus, apparently they weren't even identical twins, just fraternal, so they wouldn't have actually looked alike. She very clearly didn't feel comfortable with it.  I figured I probably shouldn't do it since Aunt Ann had quite clearly said no. When I told her, Grandma didn't seem upset or disappointed, she just said that she understood, and thanked me for looking into it. I told her if she ever wanted to talk to me about Sophia or make something else in memorial, I'd do it, but she said that it was fine, and it was so long ago it didn't really matter. She never brought it up again.  I thought that was the end of it, but years later now, I was chatting with one of my much younger cousins (not Aunt Ann's kid). Apparently she had never heard about Aunt Ann's twin, and grew quite upset with me when I told the story of the Photoshop request. She said that was a really heartless thing to do, to deny our grieving grandma's one chance to see what could've been. It could've given her some closure. She said I should've just done the picture anyways and just not told Aunt Ann about it. She would've never known.  Now I'm feeling guilty.  Even if it wasn't Sophia Rose, Grandma still could've pretended for just a moment that her lost daughter was there. It wouldn't have been hard to do it in secret, and I could've at least given her that.
