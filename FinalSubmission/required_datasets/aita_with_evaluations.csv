0,AITA for asking my friend to move a picture of him and his wife because it made my wife uncomfortable?,"  Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.   Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that!   For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.   Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was ""bonkers"" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some ""explicit"" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such ""demand"" and be pushy still.   This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.   Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him.

They've been dating for a few years, and while we get along well, he has a tendency to display photos and memorabilia from past relationships. When they settled into their new place, he put up a large, sentimental photo of him with his ex-girlfriend at a festival. He’s mentioned how much that photo means to him, but it has become a point of tension for my wife (28F).

The issue came to a head when we visited Jake’s new place for the first time. As soon as we walked in, my wife’s face dropped when she saw the picture hanging prominently in the living room. She tried to play it cool, but I could see it was eating at her. Later, she confided in me that seeing the photo made her uncomfortable. She felt disrespected and worried that I might inadvertently compare her to Jake’s ex.

I totally understand the sentiment behind the photo, but I also want my wife to feel comfortable in any situation. So, I brought it up to Jake. I asked if he would mind taking it down or moving it to a less visible spot. I explained how it made my wife feel and stressed that it wasn’t about discrediting his past but rather about making our partner feel secure.

Jake reacted pretty negatively. He called me out for trying to dictate what he can or can't do in his own home. He insisted that I was overreacting and that I was being unreasonable. He said he had every right to honor his past, and it was unfair for me to ask him to change that. The conversation ended on a sour note, and now he’s upset with me, and I feel like I’ve ruined our friendship over this.

My wife thinks I did the right thing, while some mutual friends are divided. Some agree with me, believing that while memories are important, they shouldn’t come at the cost of a partner’s comfort. Others think I was out of line for asking him to change his decor, suggesting that it’s a part of who he is.

So, AITA for expecting my friend to remove or relocate a sentimental photo that’s making my wife uncomfortable?","My friend, Adam, has this photo on his living room wall of him and his ex-girlfriend, Sarah. They were together for seven years and broke up about five years ago. The photo itself is a beautiful, candid moment captured during their trip to Paris, a place Sarah always wanted to visit. It's framed nicely and is clearly sentimental to him.

I've been best friends with Adam since college, and Sarah was a mutual friend, so this photo has always been there. However, recently, my wife, Lisa, started getting really uncomfortable whenever we visit Adam. She mentioned that seeing the photo of Adam and Sarah makes her uneasy because of how intense their relationship was and how it seems like Adam hasn't moved on.

I understand that Adam and Sarah's relationship was significant, but I feel like it’s just a part of his past. Yet, to be supportive of my wife, I decided to talk to Adam about it. I suggested he should remove or at least relocate the photo, explaining how it made Lisa uncomfortable. I tried to be as respectful as possible, but Adam got really upset. He told me the photo holds a lot of memories for him, not just of his relationship with Sarah, but of a beautiful time in his life, and he doesn’t see why he should have to hide it.

After the conversation, Lisa was initially relieved but then felt guilty for causing a rift between me and Adam. Mutual friends are divided on the issue: some think it's just a photo and Adam has every right to keep it while others believe he should be more considerate of my wife's feelings.

Adam and I haven't spoken much since, and I feel like I've overstepped a boundary. The photo is in his house, part of his personal space, and he shouldn’t have to change it for someone else's comfort. But at the same time, I can't ignore my wife's discomfort.

So, AITA for expecting my friend to remove a sentimental photo that's making my wife uncomfortable?","My wife (28f) and I (30m) have been friends with our neighbor, Alex (31m), for years. We all have a pretty close relationship and often socialize together. I've known Alex since college, and we've hung out a few times a month for years. Our wives are close as well, and the four of us have done dinner parties and trips together.

The thing is, Alex has a bit of a sentimental streak. He's got a bunch of framed photos around his house that remind him of happy memories, and we've often joked about how they're starting to get a little overwhelming. But there's one photo in particular that's been bothering my wife lately. It's a picture of the four of us from a few years ago, but the thing is, Alex's ex-girlfriend is also in it, and she's prominently featured in the center of the group. My wife has told me that seeing this photo makes her uncomfortable because it's a painful reminder of Alex's past relationship.

I've talked to Alex about it a few times, and he's always said that he understands why the photo might be a problem for my wife, but he's really attached to it because it's one of the last memories he has of his ex. He's promised to find a way to deal with it, but the photo is still up.

I've been feeling a bit guilty about bringing this up to Alex, because I know how much the photo means to him. But at the same time, I also feel like it's my duty to support my wife and make her feel comfortable in our own home. So I've been putting pressure on Alex to take the photo down, but he's been resistant. He says that he'll do it eventually, but in the meantime, I feel like I'm stuck in this awkward position of being the messenger between Alex and my wife.

I know that Alex is coming over for dinner tonight, and I'm not sure what to do. Part of me wants to just let it go and not make a big deal out of it, but another part of me feels like I'm being a bad friend by not standing up for my wife's feelings. I guess what I'm asking is, am I being an asshole for expecting Alex to remove the photo, or am I just being a good husband?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""My friend, Adam, has this photo on his living room wall of him and his ex-girlfriend, Sarah.

For some background, my husband ""Mark"" and I have been married for five years, and his family is very close-knit. Mark’s brother passed away unexpectedly, leaving a deep impact on all of us.

A couple of weeks before the funeral, I started feeling really unwell. I’ve had a chronic condition for years that flares up from time to time, and unfortunately, it decided to rear its head right at the worst possible moment. I was exhausted, in pain, and I knew that if I were to attend the funeral, I wouldn’t even be able to be present or support my husband the way he needed me to be. 

I tried to discuss it with Mark, but he was understandably very emotional and insisted that I should be there. He said it was about family and that missing the funeral would be seen as a sign that I didn’t care. I felt torn—of course I cared, but my own health was taking a toll. After wrestling with it for several days, I decided that it would be in everyone's best interest if I stayed home to focus on taking care of myself.

The day of the funeral, I tried to reach out to Mark with supportive messages, but I could tell he was upset. When he returned home, he was clearly frustrated. He told me that I had let him down and that my absence had made him feel even more alone during such a tough time. His family also reached out to express their disappointment, saying that they couldn’t believe I chose my health over being there for them.

I completely get where they are coming from, and I genuinely feel bad for not being there for Mark and his family. But I also know that pushing through my health issues wouldn’t have been beneficial for anyone. I've been reflecting on this a lot, and I’m beginning to wonder if I was wrong to prioritize my health in such a sensitive situation. 

So, AITA for prioritizing my own health over attending my husband’s brother's funeral?","I've been dealing with some serious health issues over the past year, including a chronic condition that flares up unpredictably and leaves me bedridden for days. It's been really challenging for me, and I've been doing my best to manage my health while still trying to be present in our family life. My husband, Alex, has been mostly supportive, but recently, we hit a rough patch.

Alex's brother, Jake, passed away unexpectedly two weeks ago. It was a shock to everyone, and understandably, Alex was devastated. The funeral was scheduled for last Saturday, a few states away, which required us to fly out and stay there for a couple of days. Unfortunately, I was in the middle of one of my worst flare-ups when the time came to leave.

I explained to Alex that traveling in my condition would be incredibly difficult and could potentially worsen my health. I suggested that he go alone and represent both of us, or that I could join virtually via a video call if someone could set it up. Alex was furious. He argued that I needed to be there to support him and the family, and accused me of being selfish and prioritizing my own comfort over his grief.

Our friends and family had mixed reactions when they found out. Some understood my situation and agreed that I needed to prioritize my health, while others sided with Alex, saying that I should have pushed through the pain for this one day. My sister-in-law even called me directly to tell me how much Jake meant to everyone and how my absence was disrespectful.

In the end, Alex went alone, and when he returned, things were tense between us. He barely spoke to me for days and has since been distant. I feel guilty for not being there, but I also believe that taking care of my health was the responsible thing to do. 

So, AITA for prioritizing my own health over attending my husband's brother's funeral?","Throw away for privacy. Fake names.

I (32 F) have been married to my husband (35 M) for about 8 years. We've got two kids together, Jack (6 M) and Lily (4 F). I've had some health issues over the years - Crohn's disease, chronic fatigue, and anxiety. It's been a challenge to manage my symptoms and maintain a somewhat normal life.

My husband's brother, Alex, passed away last week. I know he wasn't the closest person to me, but I still felt a pang of sadness for my husband and his family. However, I've been dealing with some severe stomach issues and a flare-up of my Crohn's disease. I had an appointment with my specialist scheduled for the day of the funeral, which I'd been looking forward to for weeks. It was a chance to get some real answers about what's been going on with my body and to discuss some potential treatment options.

My husband was understandably upset that I couldn't attend the funeral. He thought I should have found a way to make it work, even if it meant rescheduling my appointment. His family was also disappointed, especially his mom, who felt like I was being selfish.

To make matters worse, my husband's brother's widow (Alex's wife) reached out to me and expressed her sadness that I couldn't be there to support my husband and their family during this difficult time. She mentioned that it was a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to attend the funeral and that I should have prioritized my husband's needs over my own health.

I tried to explain to my husband that I'm not being flippant about this and that my health is a serious concern. I've been dealing with these issues for years, and it's not like I'm choosing to be sick. But he just kept saying that I should have found a way to make it work.

Now, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, worried that I'll do something wrong again. I'm starting to feel like I'm being selfish for prioritizing my own health over his family's needs.

Some understood my situation and agreed that I needed to prioritize my health, while others sided with Alex, saying that I should have pushed through the pain for this one day. My sister-in-law even called me directly to tell me how much Jake meant to everyone and how my absence was disrespectful.\n\nIn the end, Alex went alone, and when he returned, things were tense between us. He barely spoke to me for days and has since been distant. I feel guilty for not being there, but I also believe that taking care of my health was the responsible thing to do. \n\nSo, AITA for prioritizing my own health over attending my husband's brother's funeral?""}]","{

2,"AITA for wanting to meet my ""daughter"" after giving up my parental rights?","Long story short: in my (40f) twenties I had a one night stand with this guy ""Nathan"" (now 41m) and got pregnant. I first thought of having an abortion, but Nathan had come from a conservative religious background (not Christian) and wanted the baby so we made a deal: I would give birth to the child and sign away my parental rights (my name is not even in her birth certificate, it's a possibility in my country) and he would pay all the medical expenses plus some extra for my troubles. That's what we did and didn't keep contact after his daughter was born.  A few weeks ago, a friend of mine who has the same religion as Nathan sent me a post from her temple's youth group (they were asking for donations for the homeless) and one of the girls from the picture looked a lot like me. I searched for her profile and found out that she had Nathan's surname and had the right age to be the baby I gave away. She's 17 now and seems to be doing fine: she is involved in charity work, apparently loves music and has lots of pictures with friends and family (Nathan, his wife and half-siblings).  I never wanted nor want to be a mother but I became curious to know more about this human I put in the world, so I texted Nathan's old phone number, which he has not changed, and asked if he would allow me to meet his daughter, since I gave birth to her and everything, and made my intentions clear: I do not want to interfere with his family, just to know her. He then wrote a long text which comes down to the fact that I am an asshole for wanting to know his daughter now after I ""abandoned"" her and that this meeting would only mess up with her head. I told him I was telling him out of courtesy because soon the girl will be an adult and be able to choose herself if she wants to meet me. He then blocked me.  Am I being the asshole here? I don't think there is any harm in meeting my ""daughter""; she already has a great family and it would only be beneficial to her to know about her own history. But maybe I am not seeing the full picture.  Also sorry for any mistakes or weird phrases, English is not my first language.  &#x200B;  UPDATE  Hi everyone. First of all, thank you for your judgement. Some of you were were pretty harsh and a bit misogynistic to be honest, but I needed to hear what the well-intentioned comments had to say. Some answers to common assumptions:   1. I wasn’t coherced into giving birth.  Nathan and I reached an agreement in a situation that involved us both. I’ll admit that I was young, didn’t know what pregnancy was really like and needed the money (which I’m not proud of but hey y’all are gonna judge me anyway).  2. I didn’t want to reach out to Nathan’s daughter just because she looks like me. I only mentioned it because this is what made me realize that the girl on the picture was the child I gave birth to, but it blew out of proportion.   3. I don’t know why some people assumed Nathan is Christian and why they were judging him for being religious. He is Jewish and I am agnostic myself but don’t think it’s a problem for him to have a strong bond with his religion. The one night stand happened when we were very young and I don’t know what his views are about that, but it doesn’t matter. His daughter apparently is very attached to their community and it’s important to her. Also I might have used the world temple wrong but I’m not Jewish myself.   4. When I said I don’t want to be a mother I didn’t mean I didn’t want a relationship with Nathan's daughter. I am not her mother since I didn’t raise and don’t want to take this place from the person who truly did: his wife. I also chose not to have children of my own.  So after reading your comments, I came to a better understanding of what my role is in this situation and decided to reach out to his wife through social media to try to make amends. She was very understanding and explained to me that Nathan had a couple of tough years being a single dad before meeting her and me coming back like that made it seem (like some of you pointed out) that I wanted to skip the hard parts and become a parent out of nowhere, which was never my intention. They told their daughter that her birth mother had to go back to her home country and couldn't  take care of her, which was kind. The wife is going to talk to Nathan to leave the door open if their daughter wants to meet me when she’s older and I gave her all my contact information for when and if the time comes. I'll admit I was being a bit selfish here, so that is the best ending I could hope for.

I’ll admit that I was young, didn’t know what pregnancy was really like and needed the money (which I’m not proud of but hey y’all are gonna judge me anyway).  2. I didn’t want to reach out to Nathan’s daughter just because she looks like me. I only mentioned it because this is what made me realize that the girl on the picture was the child I gave birth to, but it blew out of proportion.   3. I don’t know why some people assumed Nathan is Christian and why they were judging him for being religious. He is Jewish and I am agnostic myself but don’t think it’s a problem for him to have a strong bond with his religion. The one night stand happened when we were very young and I don’t know what his views are about that, but it doesn’t matter. His daughter apparently is very attached to their community and it’s important to her. Also I might have used the world temple wrong but I’m not Jewish myself.   4. When I said I don’t want to be a mother I didn’t mean I didn’t want a relationship with Nathan\'s daughter. I am not her mother since I didn’t raise and don’t want to take this place from the person who truly did: his wife. I also chose not to have children of my own.  So after reading your comments, I came to a better understanding of what my role is in this situation and decided to reach out to his wife through social media to try to make amends. She was very understanding and explained to me that Nathan had a couple of tough years being a single dad before meeting her and me coming back like that made it seem (like some of you pointed out) that I wanted to skip the hard parts and become a parent out of nowhere, which was never my intention. They told their daughter that her birth mother had to go back to her home country and couldn\'t  take care of her, which was kind. The wife is going to talk to Nathan to leave the door open if their daughter wants to meet me when she’s older and I gave her all my contact information for when and if the time comes. I\'ll admit I was being a bit selfish here, so that is the best ending I could hope for. Thank you again.'}]","OP had a one-night stand with Nathan 20 years ago, resulting in a child she gave up for adoption. She recently discovered the child's identity and reached out to Nathan, who blocked her after accusing her of being an asshole for wanting to meet his daughter. OP understands Nathan's concerns and has since reached out to his wife, who is understanding and has agreed to leave the door open for a potential meeting between OP and the daughter when she's older. OP is willing to respect the family's boundaries and wait for the daughter's consent, showing that she's not trying to disrupt their lives.",AITA for Reaching Out to My Ex's Family 20 Years After a One-Night Stand and an Adoption?,"Judgement: NAH, Title: AITA for Reaching Out to My Ex's Family 20 Years After a One-Night Stand and an Adoption?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

It was just a one-night stand that resulted in a surprise pregnancy. Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, I felt it was best for the child that I put them up for adoption. It was one of the hardest decisions I ever made, but I truly believed it was the right one at that time.

Fast forward about 20 years, and I've often found myself reflecting on that chapter of my life. I've thought about my child and what they might be like, but I've never reached out to the adoptive family. Recently, though, I found out some information about Dave's family through social media—his parents are still very much a part of his life and have shared some touching posts about their journey. This reignited a spark in me. I wanted to see how my child was doing, and perhaps even how Dave’s family felt about the situation. 

So, I reached out to them. I was nervous but thought it was important to be honest about my past and intentions. I didn’t want to disrupt anyone's life but hoped to at least share my story and maybe leave the door open for future communication if they were open to it. 

Reaching out turned out to be a mixed bag. Some family members were really friendly and supportive, while others felt it was inappropriate considering the circumstances. They were understandably protective of my child, and I completely respected that—they’re their family now. I assured them I had no intention of intruding but just wanted to check in.

The whole situation has created a lot of conversation among my friends and family. Some think I was brave for wanting to reconnect and that it’s okay to reach out after all these years. Others feel that it was inappropriate to involve my ex's family after so much time has passed and that I should have just respected the life they've built without interference.

In light of that, I wonder if what I did was wrong or if I went about it in a respectful manner. Am I the asshole for reaching out to my ex's family 20 years after a one-night stand and an adoption?","Twenty years ago, I had a one-night stand with a man I hardly knew. I found out I was pregnant a few weeks later. At the time, I was young, scared, and not in a place to raise a child, so I made the difficult decision to place the baby for adoption. It was an open adoption, and I receive yearly updates and photos through the agency. I never reached out to the biological father after finding out I was pregnant, because he made it clear he wasn’t interested in anything beyond that one night.

Fast forward to now, my daughter (whom I placed for adoption) recently turned 20. I’ve been in touch with her occasionally through letters, and recently, she expressed a desire to learn more about her biological roots, including her father’s side of the family. She knows the situation and that I never reached out to him, but she wants to understand her heritage better.

So, I decided to reach out to my ex's family. After some online sleuthing, I found what I believe to be a relative of his, and I sent them a polite message explaining the situation, emphasizing that there are no expectations of a relationship, but that it would mean a lot to my daughter to learn about her biological father’s side.

The response was mixed. Some of the family members were willing to help and answered some questions about health history and family heritage. Others were less receptive and felt it was inappropriate for me to reach out after so many years, especially given the nature of how things ended. A few expressed concern about disrupting their lives, and my ex's current spouse (whom he's been married to for 15 years) seemed particularly upset about it.

I understand their concerns, and I never intended to create any drama or discomfort. I just wanted to help my daughter find the answers she’s been searching for. My friends are split; some say I did the right thing for my daughter, while others believe I should have respected the past and left it alone.

So, am I the asshole for reaching out to my ex’s family after twenty years to help my daughter understand her roots?","I'm 35 now, but 15 years ago, I made a huge mistake. I was 20, and after a one-night stand with my then-girlfriend's ex, he and his girlfriend broke up, and she discovered she was pregnant. They decided to give the baby up for adoption, and I was the biological father. I was young, scared, and unsure of how to handle it. We went through the adoption process, and I eventually ended up with a good family who loves and takes care of the child.

Fast forward 20 years, and my daughter is now 15. I've been married for 10 years, have two kids of my own, and have been trying to move on with my life. However, I've always felt a pang of guilt and curiosity about the child I gave up for adoption. I recently found out that my ex and her family still live in the same town, and I've been thinking about reaching out to them to reconnect with my daughter.

I know it's been 20 years, and I'm not sure if she'll even remember me, but I feel a deep desire to get to know her and be a part of her life. I'm also worried about how my ex and her family will react to my sudden interest in meeting my daughter. I'm scared that they'll be angry or hurt that I never made contact before.

I finally worked up the courage to send a message to my ex's sister on social media, explaining my situation and asking if it would be okay to reach out to her and her family. To my surprise, she replied and said that her family would be open to meeting me, but she warned me that they might be a little upset about my delayed interest.

I'm still unsure about what to do next. Part of me is excited at the prospect of meeting my daughter and starting a new chapter in my life, but another part of me is terrified of rejection or anger from her family.

3,AITA for making my roommate replace my garlic that she used?,"Last week, I came home and my roommate told me that without asking me, she had used the garlic I had in the fridge. I was bothered that she didn’t bother to ask me when it would take a two minute text exchange. She just expected I’d be okay with her using something I bought because we lived together, and didn’t think of how it could inconvenience me if I needed to use garlic that night. To be fair to her, she said she’d replace it, but didn’t give any timeline on when that would be.   And some important context: my current roommate knows I had a history of shitty roommates that take advantage of my kindness. I chose her specifically because I didn’t expect she’d be the type to do that. Hence why this stung.   Anyways, told her I was upset that she used it, and that she needed to replace it tonight. She fought back, but went out and bought some.   She came back with the garlic cloves separated and peeled instead of a fresh bulb. In my opinion, there is a difference in how the two taste, and I told her I wanted the actual bulb instead of what she got me. She started complaining but went and bought the bulb, which should have ended things.   I had forgiven her and moved on, but apparently she’s been telling our friends a filtered version of the story to make me look bad and apparently mocking me for it, which obviously hurts. I don’t think I’m the villain here, but everyone else does and I feel alone.

Emily has a habit of borrowing my stuff without asking, and while I generally try to be chill about it, this time it really pushed my buttons. 

A few weeks ago, I bought a few heads of garlic from the farmer's market because I love cooking with fresh ingredients. I specifically put them on a shelf in the kitchen that I designated as “mine” to avoid confusion. I came home one day to find that all my garlic was gone. I assumed she took it without asking since she has a tendency to do that with perishable items she knows I love.

After realizing they were gone, I confronted her about it, and she initially denied it. But then, later on, I overheard her joking with some friends that I was “hoarding garlic” like it was some kind of precious resource. I was so frustrated because it felt disrespectful and just plain silly—I'm no garlic hoarder! 

So, I snapped a bit and told her that if she wanted to borrow stuff, she should at least ask and not spread lies about it. Emily got defensive and accused me of overreacting. She said I was being dramatic about a “trivial” situation and that it was just garlic at the end of the day. We went back and forth, and honestly, it escalated into a pretty ugly fight.

Our friends who witnessed the whole thing have mixed thoughts. Some agree with me and think she should respect my things and be more considerate, while others say I was being too uptight over something small. 

Now, the tension between us is awkward, and I feel guilty for how I reacted, but I still think it’s unfair for her to take my stuff without asking and lie about it. 

So, AITA for being mad at my roommate for stealing garlic and spreading a lie about it?","My roommate (22F) and I (23F) have been living together for about six months now. We’ve generally had a pretty good dynamic, but lately, things have gotten rocky over something seemingly trivial—garlic.

Last week, I noticed that the jar of minced garlic I keep in the fridge had been going down much faster than usual. I use it often, but I know for sure I didn’t use that much. When I asked my roommate about it, she denied taking any initially. I let it slide, thinking maybe I misjudged how much I had left.

A few days later, I walked in on her clearly using my minced garlic while cooking. I confronted her again, and she finally admitted to using it but insisted it was just a little bit and only once or twice. Annoyed but not wanting to start a huge fight over garlic, I told her to just ask next time and let her know I didn’t appreciate the lying.

Fast forward to the weekend, and one of our mutual friends mentioned how they heard I’ve been hoarding food and not sharing anything, which is not true at all. I frequently share ingredients and even cook meals for us sometimes. Turns out, my roommate had been telling people that I freaked out over the garlic and hoarded the food, painting me as this stingy, unreasonable person.

When I confronted her about spreading this lie, she got defensive and said that I was overreacting and making a big deal out of nothing. She claimed she only said that because she felt I was being too controlling over communal stuff and that my reaction was over the top for such a minor issue.

Our friends are divided. Some say I’m justified in being upset since she lied and then made it seem like I’m the bad guy. Others think it's just garlic and I should let it go, arguing that I did overreact and come off as controlling.

Now, things are tense, and it’s affecting not just us but our friend group too. I acknowledge I might have blown up a bit, but I’m hurt by the dishonesty and the way she portrayed me to others. She says I’m overreacting and need to chill out.

So, AITA for being mad at my roommate for stealing garlic and spreading a lie about it, or did I take this too far?","I've been living with my roommate, Alex, for about a year now. We get along pretty well, but we've had our fair share of disagreements. One thing that's always bothered me is when Alex takes food from our communal kitchen without asking. It's not just a matter of him taking my food, it's that he never seems to think it's a big deal to take anything that's not his.

Recently, I came home from work to find that Alex had taken my jar of garlic. I was looking forward to making a meal that night and now I had no garlic. I asked Alex if he knew anything about it and he just shrugged it off saying he hadn't taken it. I'm pretty sure he was lying, but I didn't want to accuse him of it right then.

The next day, Alex comes to me and says that I'm being really unfair for accusing him of taking the garlic. He says that he had a friend over the night before and they must have taken it. I'm not buying it, but I let it slide.

However, what really got me was when Alex started telling other people in the house that I had taken the garlic and then denied it when confronted. He even went so far as to say that I was being ""paranoid"" for accusing him of taking it. I'm not paranoid, I just know that Alex has a history of taking food without asking.

I finally lost my temper and told Alex that I know he took the garlic and that he's spreading lies about it. He just shrugged it off and said that I'm being too sensitive. I'm still fuming about the whole situation and I don't know how to deal with it.

I feel like Alex is taking advantage of our living situation and not respecting my boundaries. I'm starting to wonder if I'm being too lenient with him.

4,AITA for bringing my wheelchair bound boyfriend to my brother's no +1 wedding?," My f31 brother m33 got married days ago. He and his now wife sent me an invitation and mentioned a ""no +1"" rule.

And two, I could not find proper arrangements to have someone watch him (I'm his primary caregiver) while I was gone.   I brought him with me to the wedding. My brother and his bride were livid and picked up an argument with me about it. My brother said some hurtful stuff but I was glad he didn't say it infront of my boyfriend. I told him it's not like my boyfriend was making a fuss or being distracting (he just remained quiet and respectful of everyone around him) my brother argued that non of that matter and that the trust and respect he had for me was gone the minute I decided to stomp on his wedding boundaries and override the rules. My parents understood my side but also said that it was my brother's wedding and I should've respected the rule he had for non-official couples.   We've not been talking since the wedding. I tried calling him but keep getting hung up on. His wife texted me yesterdag to stop calling.   AITA?

My younger brother (let's call him Jake) just got married last weekend, and it was a pretty big deal for him and his fiancée. They had a lot of specific rules and expectations for the wedding day, which they laid out clearly for all guests. Things like a strict dress code, no plus-ones unless explicitly invited, and an alcohol-free ceremony. They really wanted everything to go their way, and I get that it’s their day.

Now, I consider myself pretty close to my brother, but honestly, I wasn't on board with some of these rules. For one, I think the dress code was a bit over the top; it was a casual wedding but they wanted everyone in formal attire. I ended up wearing a nice sundress instead of a full-on gown. I also had a friend in town who I hadn’t seen in ages, and I invited her to the reception since I was given the impression it was going to be a more relaxed celebration afterward. 

When the day finally came, I arrived in my sundress, and I could see Jake's face when he noticed. I could also see he was annoyed when I showed up with my friend, who wasn’t on the guest list. It didn’t help that I brought along a bottle of wine to share during the reception. Let’s just say he lost it. He pulled me aside and told me I was disrespecting him and his new wife’s wishes, ruining what was supposed to be a perfect day for them. I tried to explain that I was there to celebrate and wanted to make it special for both of us, but he was having none of it.

After the wedding, my parents weighed in. They sided with Jake, saying I should have respected their wishes, and that it was inconsiderate of me to show up as I did. Some other relatives agreed with them, while a few thought I wasn’t in the wrong for trying to make the day more enjoyable for myself and my friend. 

Now I feel terrible about how things went down. I love my brother and didn't intend to ruin anything, but I also don't think I should have to completely change myself for his day either. So, AITA for disregarding my brother’s wedding rules and expectations?","My (28F) brother (31M) recently got married, and it was a big deal for our family. My brother and his fiancée are very particular people, and they had a whole list of rules and expectations for their wedding. Some of these rules included no kids, a specific dress code, and strict instructions about social media posts. They even had a wedding planner who was like a hawk, making sure everyone followed the guidelines.

A few weeks before the wedding, I found out that my partner (27M) had a work commitment that clashed with the wedding date. This was a rare and important opportunity for him, so I decided to attend the wedding without him. It was a bit awkward because the RSVP was already sent, but I thought it wasn't a big deal and didn't inform my brother. 

On the wedding day, I wore a dress that slightly deviated from the color scheme. It was still formal, but I chose something I felt more comfortable in. At the reception, I posted a few candid pictures of the ceremony on my Instagram story against their request to wait until they posted the official photos. 

Later that evening, my brother pulled me aside. He was livid about my partner not showing up without any prior notice, my outfit choice, and my social media posts. I apologized but felt that he was overreacting. My partner's work commitment was unavoidable, and I didn't think my dress or a few Instagram posts would ruin their day.

Our parents sided with him, saying that wedding rules should be respected, and I should have communicated better about my partner. My friends, however, think the rules were too stringent and that I did nothing wrong by expressing myself.

Now, there's a lot of tension between my brother and me. He's been distant and cold, which is unusual for us. I understand that it was his special day, but I also feel that he and his fiancée were too controlling.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for disregarding my brother's wedding rules and expectations?","My brother is getting married in a few months and he and his fiancée have made it very clear what they expect from us, their family members. They've even made a list of rules that they want us to follow, from not mentioning the word ""wedding"" until the big day, to not talking about their relationship or the upcoming nuptials.

My brother and his fiancée have also made it clear that they want a very traditional and formal ceremony, and that we should all dress accordingly. They've even sent out a dress code email to all of the guests, specifying that men should wear a suit and tie and that women should wear a cocktail dress.

However, I have a very close relationship with my brother's fiancée, and I've been feeling a bit left out of the planning process. She's always talking about how she wants everything to be perfect, and how she's been stressing about every little detail. I tried to be supportive, but it felt like she was getting more and more controlling by the day.

So, when my brother told me that he and his fiancée were having a ""no gift"" policy, I decided to disregard that rule. I know my brother is a bit of a sentimental person, and I figured he'd appreciate a thoughtful gift from me. I also know that his fiancée is always going on about how much she loves handmade and unique gifts, so I decided to make her a custom piece of jewelry.

But here's the thing: I didn't tell my brother about the gift. I just showed up to the rehearsal dinner with a small box in my hand and presented it to his fiancée. I thought it was a sweet gesture, but my brother was furious. He felt like I had disrespected him and his fiancée's wishes, and that I was trying to undermine their authority.

Now, his fiancée is being super passive-aggressive and my brother is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel like I was just trying to be kind and thoughtful, but I guess that was the wrong approach.

My brother and his fiancée are very particular people, and they had a whole list of rules and expectations for their wedding. Some of these rules included no kids, a specific dress code, and strict instructions about social media posts. They even had a wedding planner who was like a hawk, making sure everyone followed the guidelines.\n\nA few weeks before the wedding, I found out that my partner (27M) had a work commitment that clashed with the wedding date. This was a rare and important opportunity for him, so I decided to attend the wedding without him. It was a bit awkward because the RSVP was already sent, but I thought it wasn't a big deal and didn't inform my brother. \n\nOn the wedding day, I wore a dress that slightly deviated from the color scheme. It was still formal, but I chose something I felt more comfortable in. At the reception, I posted a few candid pictures of the ceremony on my Instagram story against their request to wait until they posted the official photos. \n\nLater that evening, my brother pulled me aside. He was livid about my partner not showing up without any prior notice, my outfit choice, and my social media posts. I apologized but felt that he was overreacting. My partner's work commitment was unavoidable, and I didn't think my dress or a few Instagram posts would ruin their day.\n\nOur parents sided with him, saying that wedding rules should be respected, and I should have communicated better about my partner. My friends, however, think the rules were too stringent and that I did nothing wrong by expressing myself.\n\nNow, there's a lot of tension between my brother and me. He's been distant and cold, which is unusual for us. I understand that it was his special day, but I also feel that he and his fiancée were too controlling.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for disregarding my brother's wedding rules and expectations?""}]","{

Edit to add because everyone keeps asking: the childcare for our 2 year old is covered as a benefit from my job, so we aren't paying for it.""}]","OP is upset that his wife is spending £30 a week on ballet lessons for their 2-year-old daughter without discussing it with him first. He calls the lessons a waste of money and tells his wife that she should have discussed it with him, leading to a heated argument and his wife not speaking to him since. However, OP fails to consider the value of his daughter's happiness and development, and is being overly controlling and dismissive of his wife's parenting decisions, making him the asshole in this situation.",'AITA for Freaking Out on My Wife for Spending £30 a Week on Ballet Lessons for Our 2-Year-Old?',"Judgement: ESH, Title: 'AITA for Freaking Out on My Wife for Spending £30 a Week on Ballet Lessons for Our 2-Year-Old?'","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

Recently, I found out that my wife has been spending £30 a week on ballet lessons for our daughter. 

At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as the weeks went on, I started to notice how that money could add up. I mentioned to my wife that we have other expenses—like her nursery fees, groceries, and saving for a family vacation. I was trying to suggest we could save that £30 for things that might be more impactful for our daughter, like music classes or swimming lessons instead, which I believed would be more beneficial at this age. 

When I brought it up, she became defensive. This quickly escalated into an argument, and I ended up freaking out on her. I expressed my frustration that she was spending what I saw as a significant amount on something our daughter wouldn’t even appreciate yet. My wife argued that ballet could help with coordination and introduce our daughter to activities she might enjoy, and I get that, but I felt the money could be better spent elsewhere.

In the aftermath of the argument, I realized I might have overreacted. My wife said she felt like I was dismissing her desire to nurture our daughter's interests, and that I was being controlling. I can see where she’s coming from, but it still feels frustrating knowing how tight our budget can be.

Now, our relationship feels strained, and I regret how I handled the situation. My friends think I had a valid point about the costs, while others believe I should have supported my wife's choice. Am I the asshole for freaking out on my wife for spending £30 a week on ballet lessons for our 2-year-old?","My wife (28F) and I (30M) have been married for four years. We have a beautiful 2-year-old daughter, Emily. Recently, my wife decided to enroll Emily in ballet lessons. While I understand that she wants to introduce our daughter to different activities early, I was shocked when I found out these lessons cost £30 a week.

We have always been cautious about our budget, especially since we are trying to save up for a house. Both of us work, but our incomes aren't exactly high, and £30 a week adds up quickly. When I approached my wife about the cost, she brushed me off, saying it was a small price to pay for Emily's happiness and development.

The final straw came last week when I saw our bank statement and realized how much we had spent on these lessons already. I snapped and confronted her, asking why she didn't discuss such a significant expense with me first. I was angry and probably louder than I should have been. My wife got defensive and told me I was overreacting, saying that it's important for Emily to start developing skills early.

I agree that activities are essential, but our daughter is only two. I feel like it's too early for something as structured as ballet, especially when it impacts our savings. We got into a huge argument, and she accused me of not wanting the best for Emily. I, in turn, accused her of being irresponsible with our finances.

Our friends are divided on the issue. Some agree with me, saying that we need to prioritize saving for our future. Others side with my wife, suggesting that investing in Emily’s interests and development is worth the cost.

In the end, we've both cooled down, but there's still tension between us. We haven't come to a resolution, and it feels like this issue is just festering. So, am I the asshole for freaking out on my wife for spending £30 a week on ballet lessons for our 2-year-old, or was I justified in my concerns about our budget?","My wife and I have a 2-year-old daughter and we're on a tight budget. We've been struggling to make ends meet since we lost our jobs due to the pandemic, and our finances are still recovering. My wife has always been keen on ballet and wants our daughter to have the same opportunities. She's been taking our daughter to £30 a week ballet lessons for the past six months.

I've been working non-stop to try and get our finances back on track, but I've been getting increasingly frustrated with our daughter's ballet lessons. Not only is it an expense we can't afford, but I also feel like it's a waste of money. My wife has been trying to get me to see the benefits, but I just don't see it. I feel like our daughter is still at a stage where she's just playing and learning, and I don't think ballet lessons are necessary.

Last week, I finally lost my temper and freaked out on my wife when she came home from the ballet lessons. I told her that we can't afford it and that she's being irresponsible. My wife was taken aback and hurt, and she accused me of being a ""ball of ice"" who never shows emotion. She said that the ballet lessons are making her happy and that I should be supporting her instead of criticizing her.

We had a huge argument and I ended up storming out of the house. My wife has been crying all day and I feel terrible for upsetting her. But at the same time, I still feel like we can't afford the ballet lessons and that my wife is being unrealistic.

Now, my wife is refusing to talk to me and I'm feeling guilty for freaking out on her. I feel like I'm being the asshole, but at the same time, I think my wife is being irresponsible with our finances.

I'm not sure what to do or how to fix this situation.

6,"AITA for leaving my girlfriend ""stranded"" when she chose to ignore me?","I 27 went to a pumpkin patch with my girlfriend 22 and a bunch of her friends.  I was told it was a couples thing but I was the only guy there.  That's fine. I am okay with her friends. I am past the whole cutesy date thing but I like making her happy.    But then they all started ignoring me. Every time I tried to join a conversation or spend time with my girlfriend I got frozen out.  Like I was intruding.  I asked her if she wanted to go do the corn maze with me and it was like I was some creepy guy at a bar. They all had to come along. Like I was trying to seperate her. I totally was but I don't think that's a bad thing.    Anyways they all decided to split up in the maze and my girlfriend went with them.    Fuck this noise.  I could go catch the Seahawks game if I boogied.  So I texted her that she had five minutes to respond to me or I was going back to town to watch the game and she could get a ride back with her friends.    I was literally watching the second quarter before she responded.  It took her that long to notice that I was gone.  She said her friend would have to drive really far out of her way to drop her off and that I should come get her.    I was definitely over the limit and I told her to get an Uber and I would pay for it. She said never mind and spent the night at her place instead.    I just woke up to about fifty texts from her and her friends calling me an asshole for leaving without telling anyone.    I did tell her. She just chose to ignore me.    I'm kind of pissed that I wasted all that gas and time and we never even got to actually spend time together.  I'm upset with her and her bullshit friends.    AITA?  Edit to provide answers to common questions.   We have been dating for about six months.    Our age difference is roughly 3 years and 10 months.  I didn't realize that made me a dirty old man.    I enjoy taking her out and having fun. She is just starting her career and I am established in mine.  So I like taking her out for fun stuff she enjoys.   When I said I am past the cutesy date thing I meant that I would not be the one to suggest a date at a pumpkin patch.  But she was a theater kid and I took her to see Hamilton. She loved it.  I go out of my way to take her to things she will enjoy.  And when we hang out with my friends they all include he because she is awesome.  My friends' wives and girlfriends all in life her in stuff too.    This is the first time she has behaved like this.    The pumpkin patch had five bars of signal and all of them were posting constantly the entire time they were there.  Edit number two because I can't do math.   The difference in our ages is exactly four years and 37 days.  Sorry.  Edit three   For those of you with a problem with our age difference think of it as her robbing the grave not me robbing the cradle.  Final edit I think.    We spoke.  It turns out that the friends were pissed that I showed up. Not because I was there but because the other boyfriends all blew them off to watch the game. So they basically convinced her that it should be a girls day.  Which was fine. If she had told me I would have gone to a pub nearby to get some food, have a beer and wait for her to get back to me.

I love the fall season, and I was excited to enjoy some fun activities together. However, as the day went on, things took a turn for the worse.

When we arrived, my girlfriend and her friends immediately started to plan their day, and I noticed they were all chatting and laughing while I was left out of the conversation. I tried to join in, sharing my thoughts on which pumpkins were the best and suggesting some fun games, but they seemed to brush me off. They were so caught up in their own little world that I felt like I was invisible.

After a while, I decided to go for a walk by myself, hoping to cool down and maybe gather my thoughts. I thought maybe they would miss me and come looking for me, but I came back to find them still engrossed in their own jokes, completely disregarding my presence. I felt hurt and frustrated. I had made an effort to be there, and it was disheartening to feel like I was just an afterthought.

Eventually, I snapped. I told my girlfriend that I felt ignored and that if they didn’t want me around, I would just leave. She and her friends laughed it off, thinking I was joking. That was the final straw for me. I left the pumpkin patch and went home, feeling a mix of anger and disappointment.

Now, my girlfriend is upset with me for abandoning her and her friends, claiming that I overreacted and should have just communicated my feelings instead of storming off. Some of her friends have also reached out to tell me that I needed to be more understanding since they were just having a good time and didn’t mean to exclude me.

In hindsight, I realize that my actions in leaving might have been a bit extreme, but I felt completely ignored. AITA for leaving my girlfriend and her friends at the pumpkin patch after they ignored me?","My girlfriend, Sarah, and I have been dating for almost a year. She and her friends often have these big group outings, and although I’m naturally more introverted, I usually go to make her happy. Last weekend, Sarah planned a trip to a pumpkin patch with me and her friends. She was really excited, and I was too, thinking it’d be a fun day together.

When we got there, though, it felt like I was invisible. Sarah and her friends immediately grouped together, chatting and laughing, and I was left trailing behind. I tried to join their conversations multiple times, but they barely acknowledged me. I smiled, made comments, and attempted to engage, but it was like I didn’t exist to them.

It got worse when we started doing the activities. Sarah would take photos with her friends, run ahead with them, and I was left alone most of the time. The final straw came when they all decided to go to a food truck and didn’t even tell me. I found out because I saw them in the line from afar.

I felt completely ignored and hurt. I texted Sarah that I was leaving and drove home. I understand it might have been a bit dramatic, but I was really upset. When she got back, she was furious, saying I embarrassed her and her friends were asking why I left.

I explained why I felt the way I did, but she thinks I overreacted and should have just stuck it out. Some of our mutual friends are divided. A few say I was justified because they were being rude, but others think I should have just brought it up to Sarah directly rather than leaving.

Now things are tense between us, and I’m questioning if I handled it the right way. Should I have just dealt with it or tried harder to talk to Sarah in the moment? 

AITA for leaving them at the pumpkin patch after being ignored?","I (25M) have been dating my girlfriend, Sarah (22F), for about a year now. We're pretty happy together, but there have been some issues lately. She's really close with her friends from college, and they often come over to our place. While I like them, I sometimes feel a bit left out because they seem to have their own little clique.

Last weekend, Sarah and her friends, Emily and Rachel, asked me to take them to the pumpkin patch. I agreed, but as soon as we got there, they started ignoring me and talking about their own stuff. I tried to join in a few times, but they didn't seem interested in having me around. I started to feel like I was just a chauffeur, taking them to the pumpkin patch and paying for their pumpkins.

I brought it up with them, saying that I felt a bit left out and that I was only there to hang out with Sarah, but they just brushed it off. Emily said I was being too sensitive, and Rachel said I was being a ""buzzkill."" I felt really hurt and frustrated, so I said I was going to go get some snacks while they continued to take photos with the pumpkins. I left the group and went to get some food, thinking that they would eventually realize their mistake and come find me.

But when I got back, they were all gone. They had left me there, at the pumpkin patch, without a word. I was furious. I called Sarah, and she just laughed it off, saying that I was being too dramatic. She told me that I should've just gone with the flow and not gotten so worked up.

I ended up leaving the pumpkin patch, and Sarah and her friends went home without me. We had a huge fight about it when I got home, and she said that I was being possessive and controlling. I feel like I'm the one who's been hurt here, but she's not taking responsibility for her actions.

I know I might have overreacted a bit, but I feel like I was treated poorly.

7,AITA for beating my coworker's kid at super smash bros.,"So this happened at a small Halloween get together I went to with a few work friends. A lot of them are older than me (28) and are at the point that they have kids like the person whose house we were. They are somewhere in their 50's I don't know the exact age but they have a few kids the youngest of which was like 8 or 9 and was at the party.   The kid is just bored and trying to do something, his dad mentions that I might play some of the same games he does and yeah sure enough we both play smash brothers. Kids asks if I want to play a game and I'm bored so I agree.  This is where I totally wipe the floor with the kid. Like no contest at all. He trys several different game modes and rules to try and get a win in and he takes the l every time. After a few losses he's getting visibly frustrated, his teenaged sibling tries to keep him calm to no avail. I just keep letting the kid play me as long as he wanted to, i wasnt particularly egging him on or anything either i would usually just ask if he wanted to go again.  Eventually the kid has a mini tantrum and his dad has to stop what he's doing to scold him and send him to bed. It was a little awkward for everyone.  No one ever directly put blame on me for it but I could kinda tell from the vibe in the room that they low key blamed me for the outburst as well. And there were lots of small Comments saying things like I was a little harsh or asking why I couldn't just let him win one, or why I didn't stop playing with him after he started getting mad. I just told them I was having fun and left it at that.  I'll admit to not being the best read on social situations but I feel like none of the blame should be put on me at all. I don't feel particularly obligated to go easy on him just because he's a kid. I'm not like a go to tournaments smash player but I'm at least decent at it and I didn't hold back at all when playing him. Which I didn't see an issue with but reading the room afterwards it seems like maybe I should have.

I love gaming and have been playing Smash for years, so I thought it’d be a fun way to get everyone involved. 

My friend’s son, let’s call him Sam (10), is super into gaming too, and I’m aware he looks up to me as a sort of mentor. He was really excited about the tournament and made it clear he wanted to win. Naturally, I wanted to make the tournament competitive and fun for everyone, so I signed up for the event myself.

Long story short, during the tournament, I ended up facing Sam in the semifinals. I was aware that he was fully determined to win and was really eager to show off his skills. I tried to play a bit more casually, but I didn’t want to let him win just because he was a kid. Ultimately, I ended up wiping the floor with him, winning the match decisively. 

Sam was visibly crushed when he lost, and I felt awful. He sulked for a while, and I tried to console him, saying that losing is part of the game and that he could learn from it. Still, I could tell he was really bummed out about it and ended up leaving the tournament early. His mom was upset too, saying I should have let him win, and that I ruined his Halloween. 

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. On one hand, I believe in competition and think that kids need to learn how to lose gracefully. But on the other hand, I never intended to crush his spirit or ruin his fun. My friends are divided; some think I should have just let him win, while others say it was a fair match.

So, am I the asshole for crushing a kid's spirit at a Halloween party Smash Brothers tournament?","I recently attended a Halloween party hosted by a good friend. The party was a costume extravaganza, filled with decorations, candy, and various activities, one of which was a Smash Brothers tournament. I'm a big fan of the game and consider myself quite skilled, so I was looking forward to it.

At the party, there were a mix of adults and kids. One of the kids, let's call him Timmy, who was around 10 years old, was particularly excited about the tournament. He was dressed as Mario and kept talking about how much he loved playing Smash Brothers. Timmy's enthusiasm was infectious, and everyone encouraged him, considering he was probably the youngest participant.

The tournament started, and I noticed that most of the other adults were going easy on the kids, letting them win or at least giving them a fair chance. When it was my turn to play against Timmy, I decided to go all out. In my mind, I thought it would be a good lesson for him – to show that sometimes you have to deal with losing and that you have to work hard to win.

I played my best character and gave it my all, not holding back at all. Within a few minutes, I had completely annihilated Timmy in the game. He looked devastated, and his excitement quickly turned to disappointment. He tried to hold back tears, but it was clear that I had crushed his spirit. The room fell silent, and everyone, including the other adults and parents, looked at me with disapproval.

My friend who hosted the party pulled me aside later and told me that while they understood I wanted to play well, I should have considered the context and maybe gone a bit easier on Timmy. They reminded me that the tournament was meant to be fun for everyone, especially the kids who were looking forward to it. 

Since then, I've been feeling really conflicted. I honestly thought I was teaching him a valuable lesson, but now I'm not so sure. Some of my friends agree with me, saying that kids need to learn how to handle losing, but most think I went too far and should have shown more empathy.

So, AITA for crushing a kid's spirit at a Halloween party Smash Brothers tournament?","I'm a 35-year-old avid gamer and I love hosting Halloween parties for my friends and their kids. This year, I decided to set up a few gaming stations with popular games like Mario Kart and Smash Brothers. The kids were really excited to compete in the tournament, and I even offered a prize for the winner - a gift card to their favorite game store.

My 8-year-old neighbor, Timmy, had been practicing his Smash Brothers skills for weeks and was determined to win. He was really looking forward to competing and was proud of his skills. When he arrived at the party, I could tell he was nervous but also really excited to participate.

As the tournament began, Timmy quickly made it to the final round against a 10-year-old kid from the neighborhood. The two of them were evenly matched, and the crowd was cheering them on. However, just as the match was about to start, I realized that Timmy had been using a modded controller to give himself an advantage. I had been so caught up in the excitement of the tournament that I hadn't noticed it before.

I immediately disqualified Timmy and told him that he couldn't continue playing. The other kid won the tournament, and I gave him the prize. Timmy was devastated. He started crying and said that I was ruining his Halloween. I tried to explain to him that using a modded controller was against the rules and that it wasn't fair to the other kids.

Now, my wife is saying that I was too harsh and that I crushed Timmy's spirit. She thinks that I should have just let him continue playing and given him a warning instead of disqualifying him. But I think I did the right thing. Cheating is cheating, and I don't want to encourage it.

Her aunt's 21-year-old daughter Rose is struggling to pay for housing and wants to stay with Alice for a while. OP's husband Tom insists that Rose should stay for free, but OP thinks she should pay rent. However, OP is being inconsistent by not applying the same logic to Alice, who is in a similar situation.

She's been taking is really hard, crying and staying in her bed all day for the past few days. My wife Carly (F52) and I (M50) have been doing our best to support her, but Sheila's been devastated. She hasn't told us why they broke up. Anyway, my other daughter Tory (F23) is coming home for the weekend from her college city, as it's her birthday. We were all planning on having a birthday dinner at Tory's favorite restaurant. Tory spent the entire summer in Seattle for an internship, so we haven't gotten to see her much this year. Thus, we cherish it whenever the family gets together.\n\nHowever, Shiela said that she wasn't feeling up for the birthday dinner due to her being depressed over the breakup. She also said she's gonna need a long time to recover, and that Tory already said she was fine with Shiela skipping the dinner to recover. I told Shiela I'm doing my best to be empathetic, but we all don't get to see Tory often. I said I understood the breakup was painful, but she wasn't ever gonna feel better until she eventually got out of bed. If anything, I said seeing her sister again could probably put her in a better mood. Shiela said again that Tory was fine with it, and Carly mentioned that she could've been lying to avoid hurting Shiela. Shiela lashed out and accused us both of being selfish. I said that we could talk about this in a civil manner, but Shiela told me the breakup was still fresh and needed to mourn the last two years of love. I said I understood that, but it would just be really nice to get the family all together to have some fun. Shiela lashed out and told me to stop changing her mind. I said again that she WAS going to the dinner, and Shiela stormed up to her room.\n\nIt's been an hour, and Shiela hasn't come out of her room. I've been downstairs thinking about all this. Carly said both Shiela and I were being a bit close-minded, but I'm starting to wonder if I fucked up. AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Expecting My College-Aged Daughter to Pay Rent When She Already Gets Financial Support?'""}]","My daughter Mia (19) is a sophomore in college, and we’ve always made it a priority to support her education and living expenses. While I cover her tuition, textbooks, and provide a monthly allowance for groceries and necessities, I also made it clear that she would need to contribute something while living at home during the summer.

After her first year, Mia decided she wanted to spend the summer back home instead of getting an internship. I was completely fine with that, but I told her I expected her to pitch in by paying a small portion of rent. I explained to her that it’s not about the money itself—it's about her learning financial responsibility and understanding the value of contributing to the household.

When I first brought it up, Mia was shocked and felt hurt, saying that since I already support her financially, expecting her to pay rent was unreasonable. I tried to explain that while I’m more than happy to help her out, I wanted her to take on some responsibility and be part of a household. After all, her brother, who’s 21, has been paying rent while he finishes his degree too.

Mia’s been really upset about it, and she feels like I’m being harsh. My wife, Sarah, agrees with Mia and thinks I’m being unfair, especially since I support her education. She believes that I should be happy Mia is home for the summer. I love my daughter and want the best for her, but I also believe in the importance of life lessons.

Now, Mia's been distant, and I can't help but feel guilty for pushing this issue. I’m starting to question whether I’m being unreasonable expecting her to pay anything at all, especially since I'm already supporting her so much. AITA for expecting my college-aged daughter to pay rent when she already gets financial support?","My daughter, Emily (F20), is a sophomore in college. She goes to a school about two hours away from home and lives in an off-campus apartment. My wife and I have been supporting her financially by paying for her tuition, books, and a small monthly allowance to cover her basic needs. Emily also works a part-time job to have some spending money of her own.

Recently, my wife Cathy (F48) and I (M50) had a discussion about teaching Emily more responsibility. We thought it would be a good idea for her to start paying a small amount of rent to us each month. We figured it would help her learn to budget better and prepare her for the real world. We decided on $200 a month, which we thought was reasonable considering that we cover most of her major expenses.

When I brought this up to Emily during one of her visits home, she was visibly upset. She said that balancing school and work was already stressful enough and that adding an additional financial burden would only increase her stress. She also mentioned that many of her friends don't have to pay rent to their parents and felt it was unfair for us to ask this of her when we were already providing financial support. I tried to explain our perspective, saying that we wanted her to learn about financial responsibility and that $200 wasn't an unreasonable amount.

Emily started crying and said that we were putting unnecessary pressure on her. Cathy, who had initially agreed with me, began to look concerned and suggested we reconsider. However, I felt that we should stick to our decision to teach her this important lesson. Emily then went back to her apartment and has been distant ever since, barely answering my texts or calls. Cathy thinks we might have been too hard on her and suggested we drop the idea for now, but I'm not sure if that's the right move.

Friends and family have mixed opinions. Some agree with me, saying it's a good way to teach responsibility, while others think we're being too harsh and adding unnecessary stress to Emily's life. 

Now, I'm starting to question whether I was too strict in my approach. Emily is a good kid, does well in school, and has always been responsible. Maybe I should have taken her feelings more into account.

So, AITA for expecting my college-aged daughter to pay rent when she already gets financial support?","My daughter is 20 years old, a college sophomore, and has been living with me and my husband for the past 4 years. We've been supporting her financially, covering everything from tuition and fees to food and entertainment expenses. I've always made it clear to her that our support is temporary and that she needs to learn how to be financially independent. She's been working part-time on campus, but her income is minimal.

Recently, we sat down with her to discuss her plans for the future, including finding a place to live off-campus. I made it clear that we would no longer be supporting her financially, and that she would need to pay rent and utilities. I also mentioned that she would need to find a roommate to split the costs with. I thought this would be a reasonable expectation, given that she's now in her 20s and should be learning how to manage her finances.

However, my daughter was upset and felt that it was unfair to expect her to pay rent when she's still in school and doesn't have a steady income. She claimed that it would be too expensive for her to find a place and pay rent, and that she would have to drop out of school to work full-time just to make ends meet. I tried to explain that this is exactly the point - she needs to learn how to balance work and school, and that paying rent would be a crucial part of that process.

Things escalated, and my daughter accused me of being cruel and unsupportive. She said that I'm not willing to help her and that I'm just trying to kick her out of the house. I feel like I'm being reasonable and that I'm just trying to prepare her for the real world. I also feel like she's being entitled and not taking responsibility for her own finances.

We went on a vacation with my sister, her husband, their 2 girls (14 and 12), and my brother, his wife, their 2 girls (15 and 13), and their son (20). \n\nThe house we booked has a huge bunkroom that all of the girls were going to sleep in. There were 2 bunk beds with trundle beds underneath and a single bed. Amelia is very sick and can\'t sleep on the top bunk because she has a hard time getting up and down the ladder. The trundles are also out of the question because she has a hard time standing up when she\'s that close to the ground. That leaves the bottom bunks and the single bed. I told my brother and sister that Amelia needs the bottom bunks or single bed. They both said that should be fine. \n\nWe got to the house and the girls ran to start calling their beds. Usually when we all travel somewhere, the girls choose their beds in order from oldest to youngest but I assumed my brother and sister talked to their kids about Amelia needing either the bottom bunk or single beds. Anyway, Amelia was left with a top bunk. \n\nShe came to tell me what happened so I went to talk to my daughters and nieces and see if anyone was willing to switch with Amelia. Everyone, including my daughters, said it\'s not a big deal, they\'ve always chosen beds this way, and the top bunks aren\'t even that high up. I told Amelia she was going to sleep in the bedroom with me and my wife. She was upset about it but we told her it\'s better for her because she needs to sleep early and take naps anyway. \n\nShe went to play with her cousins and everything was okay the first day but on the second day, she ran to us crying because her cousins were teasing her for sleeping in her parents bed instead of the top bunk. We talked to them again but they brushed us off. Then I asked my older two why they didn\'t defend her but they said they didn\'t think it was a big deal and she\'s old enough to defend herself. Amelia clung to us for the rest of the day and was feeling miserable. We couldn\'t get her to play with her cousins so we decided to end the trip early and go home. \n\nMy older two were furious that we ended the trip early because she was ""too spoiled for the top bunk"" and ""couldn\'t handle a little teasing"". My brother and sister agree that she was acting a little spoiled and that I shouldn\'t have ruined the vacation for my older two because of her so now I\'m wondering if I was the asshole.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Telling My Friend I Don't Understand Racism Because I'm White?'""}]","I (28M) have a diverse group of friends, and one of my close friends, Sarah (26F), is a passionate activist for social justice and anti-racism. She's always been vocal about these issues, and I respect her dedication. We often have discussions about race, privilege, and the struggles that marginalized communities face. 

Recently, Sarah organized a small gathering to talk about racism and ways to be allies. I was excited to join, but as the conversations got deeper, I found myself feeling a little out of my depth. When she asked everyone to share their experiences with racism or how they’ve seen it manifest in society, I hesitated because, well, I’m white and have never directly experienced racism. 

When it was my turn, I awkwardly said, ""Honestly, I don’t really understand racism because I'm white. I mean, I get that it exists and it's terrible, but it's hard for me to fully grasp it since I've never lived through it."" I thought I was being honest and acknowledging my privilege, but Sarah’s reaction was immediate and intense. She called me out for being dismissive and said that my perspective was incredibly myopic. 

I felt attacked and tried to explain that I wasn’t trying to undermine her experiences or the importance of the conversation. But she continued to emphasize that my statement sounded like I was negating the reality of racism instead of recognizing how it impacts others. A few of the other attendees nodded in agreement, which made me feel even worse. 

After that, the atmosphere shifted, and I felt like I was a pariah. Sarah later told me that I had derailed an important discussion with my comment. I tried to apologize and express that I was genuinely trying to engage in the conversation the best I could, but she wasn't having it. I ended up leaving the gathering early, feeling confused and hurt. 

Now I'm reflecting on what happened. Did I really say something that bad? My friends seem to be divided. Some say I was trying to be honest about my perspective, while others believe I should have been more aware of my privilege and how that can come across as insensitive. 

So, am I the asshole for saying I don't understand racism because I'm white?","I (23M) got into a heated argument with my friend, Mia (24F), and now I'm wondering if I made a big mistake. Mia and I have been friends for almost six years. She's Black, and we've always been able to talk about anything. Recently, we were having a conversation about the challenges she faces at work. She mentioned feeling like she's constantly overlooked for promotions and sometimes hears comments that make her uncomfortable. 

I tried to be supportive and listen, but then I made a comment that I think might have crossed the line. I said, ""I don't really understand what you're going through because I'm white."" I thought I was being honest and transparent about my limitations in understanding her experiences fully. However, Mia got really quiet and then said it was incredibly dismissive of me to say that. 

I didn't see it that way at all. In fact, I thought acknowledging my lack of understanding would make it clear that I know I'm not in a position to judge how she feels. But Mia told me that by saying I don't understand, I was essentially refusing to empathize or try to understand her situation better. 

I tried to explain my point of view, saying that I wasn't trying to negate her feelings but rather being upfront about my own ignorance. She just shook her head and said, “You could try to understand instead of just writing it off.” 

Later, I mentioned this to a couple of other friends, and they seemed to be divided. Some agreed with Mia, saying it was a tone-deaf comment, while others thought I was just being honest. 

Since then, our relationship has been a bit strained. Mia is distant, and I feel guilty because the last thing I wanted was to hurt her. Looking back, I realize there were probably better ways to show my support. Maybe I should have asked more questions or expressed my desire to understand her experiences better.

Mia is yet to respond to my apology text, and I'm feeling the weight of the situation. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my friend I don't understand racism because I'm white?","I've been friends with Alex for 5 years and we've always had a great dynamic. We share similar interests and often discuss social issues. However, we've had a bit of a disagreement about racism lately. Alex, who is black, has been trying to explain to me the nuances of systemic racism and how it affects people of color in our country. I've been listening, but I have to admit, I'm still not fully understanding it. I mean, I get the basics – that racism is bad and people shouldn't be treated unfairly because of their skin color. But the deeper stuff, like how it's embedded in institutions and affects people's daily lives, is still a bit lost on me.

One day, Alex and I were talking about the recent police brutality incidents, and he said that it's not just about the individual officers who are racist, but about the system as a whole that allows this to happen. He explained that even well-intentioned white people like me are often oblivious to the ways in which we benefit from racism and perpetuate it unintentionally. I listened to what he said, but I couldn't help but feel a bit defensive. I mean, I'm not racist, right? I don't see color. I treat everyone equally.

I told Alex that I don't understand why he's being so sensitive about this. I said, ""I don't get why you're always talking about racism. Can't we just talk about something else?"" Alex was taken aback by my comment and said that I'm not taking his concerns seriously. He told me that I'm not understanding the complexity of the issue and that it's not about being ""sensitive"" but about being aware of the ways in which racism affects people's lives.

I got a bit annoyed and told him that I'm not sure why he's always expecting me to be some kind of expert on racism just because I'm white. I said, ""I don't understand racism because I'm white, so I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on it."" Alex said that's a pretty tone-deaf thing to say and that I'm not taking responsibility for my own privilege. We've been friends for a long time, but this conversation has put a bit of a strain on our relationship. I'm not sure what to do now.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I (23M) got into a heated argument with my friend, Mia (24F), and now I\'m wondering if I made a big mistake.

10,AITA for kicking my friend out of my bridal party when she's been excluding me?,"Throw away account -   So one of my friends of 15+ years, we'll call her Chelsea, got engaged to her bf of 7 years this year in February and 5 months later in June, I also got engaged to my bf of 4 years.   Because I'm currently in school for my teaching credentials, I need to get married end of June 2024 because that was my only break from school. I asked Chelsea when she was looking to have her wedding and she told me she already picked a date and it was in July 2024 - only 1 week after my wedding. When I told her the date I wanted, she called her venue and moved it another week out, but that still only leaves our weddings 2 weeks apart. I told her I wouldn't be able to make it since I'll probably still be on my honeymoon and she said she was okay with it, but I was annoyed that she's so nonchalant with me not being able to attend.   The plan was to have each other as bridesmaids so I asked her to be mine, but she didn't ask me because I won't be at the wedding, which I get, but now it feels like I'm no longer part of the friend group.  A few months ago, she texts me and my friends that she's having a dinner to celebrate her engagement and I told her I couldn't make it because I had a trip planned. On the day of my trip, my flight got delayed to the next day so I could've attended, but I didn't know when or where the dinner was because she never even bothered to send me an official invite.   Throughout the last few months, she's been texting our group chats trying to plan her bridal shower and bachelorette, but I didn't respond because I was still hurt about not being invited to the dinner and I just got busy with work. On facebook, I see that she posts a confirmation email of her booking her Miami bach trip with our friends, but didn't bother texting me separately to see if I could come.   It feels like she's been excluding me so I called her and told her that I no longer wanted her to be my bridesmaid because I was still mad our dates were so close together. She knows I'm still trying to get my teaching credentials and have no other times to get married so I don't know why she's in such a rush to get married. Ever since then, she's been hanging out with our friends without me and making it very apparent that I'm excluded.

AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Kicking My Bridesmaid Out of the Bridal Party Over Past Hurts?'""}]","I’ve been engaged for almost a year, and I was so excited to plan my wedding day. I’ve had my closest friends by my side throughout this process, including my longtime friend and bridesmaid, Sarah. We’ve known each other for over a decade, and while we’ve had some ups and downs, I always envisioned her standing beside me as I say ""I do.""

However, Sarah and I have had a complicated history. In high school, we had a pretty nasty falling out over some rumors and misunderstandings that caused a lot of hurt on both sides. We eventually reconciled, but those past issues tend to bubble up from time to time, especially when emotions run high.

Recently, during a dress fitting, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit distant and was making comments that felt undermining. She joked about my wedding planning being “overboard” and suggested I was “overreacting” when I shared my excitement about the venue. At first, I brushed it off, but as the day went on, I started to feel like her behavior was more than just teasing. It felt like a jab at my happiness rather than a friendly joke.

Finally, after a particularly hurtful comment about my choice of floral arrangements, I snapped. I told her that if she couldn’t support me during this important time in my life, maybe she shouldn’t be a part of the bridal party. It was a rash decision, fueled by all those old feelings coming back to the surface, and I kicked her out of the bridal party right then and there.

Now, with the wedding approaching, I feel both relieved and guilty. Some of my other friends think I made the right call and that it was important to stand my ground. Others, especially a few mutual friends, believe I was too harsh and that I could have addressed the issue more kindly instead of reacting impulsively.

Sarah is devastated and has reached out to me, wanting to discuss what happened. I’ve been ignoring her messages, feeling like maybe it’s better to keep my distance. But now I’m starting to wonder if I overreacted and if maybe, just maybe, I should have tried to resolve our issues instead of kicking her out of my life.

AITA for kicking my bridesmaid out of the bridal party over past hurts?","I've been planning my wedding for over a year now and it's finally just a few months away. It's been a whirlwind of emotions and decisions, but overall, it's shaping up to be my dream wedding. I have six bridesmaids, including one who used to be my best friend, Sarah.

Sarah and I have known each other since high school. We were inseparable back then, but we drifted apart during college. The reason for our fallout was pretty significant – she betrayed my trust by dating my ex-boyfriend just a month after we broke up. It took me years to get over that hurt, and while we've somewhat reconciled, our relationship has never been the same.

When I got engaged, I decided to include Sarah in my bridal party because I wanted to move past the old wounds and believed this could be a fresh start for us. Initially, things were okay, but as the wedding planning progressed, old feelings started to resurface. Every time we had a disagreement or she did something that slightly annoyed me, I would be reminded of the betrayal.

Last weekend, we had a bridesmaid dress fitting, and Sarah made an offhand comment about my ex-boyfriend, jokingly saying, ""Wow, remember when we both liked the same guy?"" That was the final straw for me. I felt my blood boil, and I just couldn't take it anymore.

I pulled Sarah aside and told her that I no longer wanted her to be part of my bridal party. I explained that her comment was the tip of the iceberg of unresolved issues and past hurts that I just couldn't ignore any longer. She was shocked and started crying, saying she thought we had moved past all that and that she was genuinely excited to support me on my big day.

When I told my fiancé and the rest of the bridal party what had happened, reactions were mixed. Some understood my feelings, but others thought I was overreacting and being too harsh, especially since the wedding is so close. My mom even suggested that I should have tried to talk things out with Sarah rather than making a hasty decision.

Now, Sarah and I aren't speaking, and I'm starting to feel guilty. Did I overreact? Should I have handled things differently? Am I the asshole for kicking my bridesmaid out of the bridal party over past hurts?","I'm getting married in two months and I'm still working on the final details of the wedding. I've known my bridesmaids since high school and we've been inseparable ever since. There's one bridesmaid in particular, let's call her Sarah, who has been a constant thorn in my side for years.

Sarah and I were close friends in high school, but as we got older, we drifted apart. We reconnected a few years ago and she became a bridesmaid, but the past hurt between us has never fully healed. It started when she ""borrowed"" my car and didn't return it for a week, claiming she was ""too hungover"" to drive it back. I was furious and we had a huge fight. Ever since then, I've felt like she's taken advantage of me and my trust.

Fast forward to a year ago, Sarah got drunk at a party and sent a series of explicit texts to my ex-boyfriend, who I've been broken up with for years. I was devastated and felt betrayed by her actions. I tried to talk to her about it, but she just brushed it off and said I was being ""sensitive.""

Now, as I'm planning my wedding, Sarah is being super helpful and enthusiastic, which is exactly the opposite of how she's been in the past. I know it's not entirely her fault, but it's hard for me to trust her. When my other bridesmaids and I were discussing the seating chart, I brought up the idea of having a ""bridesmaid-only"" dinner the night before the wedding. Sarah suggested we have a big group dinner with all of our friends and family, which I know will be chaos.

I snapped at her and told her that I didn't want her to ruin my special night, implying that she's always been a problem in my life.

It\'s been a whirlwind of emotions and decisions, but overall, it\'s shaping up to be my dream wedding. I have six bridesmaids, including one who used to be my best friend, Sarah.\n\nSarah and I have known each other since high school. We were inseparable back then, but we drifted apart during college. The reason for our fallout was pretty significant – she betrayed my trust by dating my ex-boyfriend just a month after we broke up. It took me years to get over that hurt, and while we\'ve somewhat reconciled, our relationship has never been the same.\n\nWhen I got engaged, I decided to include Sarah in my bridal party because I wanted to move past the old wounds and believed this could be a fresh start for us. Initially, things were okay, but as the wedding planning progressed, old feelings started to resurface. Every time we had a disagreement or she did something that slightly annoyed me, I would be reminded of the betrayal.\n\nLast weekend, we had a bridesmaid dress fitting, and Sarah made an offhand comment about my ex-boyfriend, jokingly saying, ""Wow, remember when we both liked the same guy?"" That was the final straw for me. I felt my blood boil, and I just couldn\'t take it anymore.\n\nI pulled Sarah aside and told her that I no longer wanted her to be part of my bridal party. I explained that her comment was the tip of the iceberg of unresolved issues and past hurts that I just couldn\'t ignore any longer. She was shocked and started crying, saying she thought we had moved past all that and that she was genuinely excited to support me on my big day.\n\nWhen I told my fiancé and the rest of the bridal party what had happened, reactions were mixed. Some understood my feelings, but others thought I was overreacting and being too harsh, especially since the wedding is so close. My mom even suggested that I should have tried to talk things out with Sarah rather than making a hasty decision.\n\nNow, Sarah and I aren\'t speaking, and I\'m starting to feel guilty. Did I overreact? Should I have handled things differently? Am I the asshole for kicking my bridesmaid out of the bridal party over past hurts?'}]","{

Overall, we have a great relationship, but there’s one area where we often clash: health decisions. My wife tends to be very protective about her health choices, believing that everything should be a mutual decision. While I respect this to a degree, I sometimes feel that it hampers my ability to take care of my own health in a timely manner.

Recently, I started experiencing some new and concerning symptoms. I’ve been feeling fatigued, having headaches, and I just generally don’t feel like myself. I knew I needed to see a doctor, but whenever I mentioned it to my wife, she would respond with concern and ask me why I didn't want to wait to discuss it further or see if it got better on its own.

After a few weeks of waiting and feeling worse, I decided that I couldn't keep putting off my health. I went ahead and made a doctor's appointment without telling her, thinking it might ease the pressure. I figured I'd go to the appointment, get some answers, and then I could discuss it with her afterward. My thought process was that it was my body, and I should have the autonomy to seek help when I need it.

When I told her about the appointment later, she was furious. She felt betrayed and accused me of undermining our partnership. She said that we should be making these decisions together, especially when it concerns my health.

I understand her perspective, but I thought I was just taking charge of my own well-being. I think she sometimes takes it too far by trying to be involved in every decision. Now, she’s not speaking to me much, and our communication is strained. 

Friends who know us have mixed opinions; some support me in taking care of my health independently, while others side with her, saying I should have included her in the decision. 

So, to wrap it up, AITA for booking a doctor's appointment without my wife's consent?","My wife (35F) and I (36M) have been married for eight years, and we have two young children together. Over the past few months, I've noticed some worrying changes in her behavior. She seems more forgetful, loses her temper quickly, and has been experiencing frequent headaches. I’ve hinted a few times that she should see a doctor, but she dismisses it, saying she’s just stressed from work and managing the kids.

A couple of weeks ago, she had an episode where she forgot to pick up our kids from school. This is extremely out of character for her, and it worried me a lot. She was mortified when she realized and apologized profusely, but I could see that she was shaken by what happened. Since then, she’s been quite defensive whenever I bring up the topic of seeing a doctor.

I’m genuinely concerned that there might be something more serious going on with her health, and I want to make sure she’s okay. Last night, after another forgetful moment where she left the stove on, I started thinking about booking an appointment with her doctor myself, just to get the ball rolling. I figured it might be easier if all she had to do was show up. However, I haven't done it yet because I know she would be furious if she found out I did this without her consent.

I mentioned this to my friend, and he was adamant that I would be overstepping and disrespecting my wife’s autonomy if I went ahead and booked the appointment without her knowledge. He thinks I should keep talking to her and encourage her to go on her own terms. My mother, on the other hand, thinks I need to take action now for the sake of our family’s well-being.

This whole situation has caused a lot of tension at home. She’s been more irritable, and I don’t want to make things worse by pushing too hard, but I’m genuinely scared for her health, and ultimately for the safety of our kids. 

So, Reddit, AITA for considering to book a doctor’s appointment for my wife without her consent?","My wife and I have been together for about 6 years now. We've been married for about 3 years. She's always been very controlling when it comes to my health. If I ever mention that I'm feeling a little off or have a minor ache, she immediately tells me that I need to make an appointment with our family doctor. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm not allowed to have a headache without her approval.

About a month ago, I started feeling some pain in my lower back. At first, it was just a dull ache, but it's been getting worse over time. I've tried stretching, taking ibuprofen, and even doing some physical therapy exercises, but the pain hasn't gone away. I've been putting off going to the doctor because I know my wife will freak out if I tell her about it. She's always worried about ""what if"" scenarios, and I've started to feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her.

Last week, the pain got so bad that I couldn't even get out of bed. I was lying there, feeling miserable, and I started to wonder if I should just book an appointment without telling my wife. I thought to myself, ""Why do I need to get her permission to go to the doctor? It's my body, and I should be able to take care of it without her approval."" I know it sounds selfish, but I felt like I was being held back by her constant worrying and nagging.

I ended up deciding not to book the appointment without telling her, but I'm still thinking about it. I feel like I'm being held back by her control issues, and I'm starting to resent her for it.

In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship.

Recently, for my birthday, my boyfriend surprised me with a beautiful piece of jewelry. I loved it, and it felt incredibly thoughtful coming from him. However, I later found out that the exact same item was also gifted to his mom and sister for their birthdays earlier this year. 

At first, I was excited, but as I learned about the other gifts, I started to feel a bit put off. I know it was a lovely gesture, and the piece is definitely something I would have picked for myself, but I couldn't shake this feeling of being just “another one of the girls” in his life. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, but it felt a little less special knowing it was a “set.” 

When I shared my feelings with my boyfriend, he was genuinely shocked and insisted that he chose it because he thought I would love it, and he never meant to diminish the gift. He assured me that he thought I deserved something beautiful just like the women in his life. He really loves his mom and sister, and it’s sweet that he wants to share that love through gifts.

My friends have been split on this. Some think I should just accept the gift for what it is and appreciate the sentiment behind it. Others believe it’s understandable to feel a bit overshadowed on my special day and that it would be better if he had chosen something unique just for me. 

After discussing it with my boyfriend, I realized he genuinely had no ill intentions, and he was just trying to make me happy. I appreciate him, and I really don’t want to cause any friction with his family either. So I’m left wondering if I was being too sensitive about the whole situation.

Am I the asshole for feeling a bit put off by receiving the same gift as my boyfriend's mom and sister?","I've been dating my boyfriend, Jake, for almost two years now. He's a wonderful guy, and we've always had a good relationship. However, something happened recently that made me feel a bit off, and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting.

For context, Jake is very close to his family. He has a younger sister, Emily, and his mom, Karen, who are both lovely people. They treat me well, and I've never had any issues with them. We often celebrate holidays and birthdays together, and gift-giving has always been a big thing in their family.

A few weeks ago, it was my birthday. Jake had told me he had something special planned, and I was excited. When the day came, he gave me a beautifully wrapped box. I opened it to find a stunning necklace. It was really pretty and exactly my style. I was genuinely touched and thanked him profusely.

Later that same week, we got together with his family to celebrate his mom's birthday. To my surprise, Jake handed his mom a similar-looking box. She opened it and found the exact same necklace he had given me. I was taken aback but didn't say anything. Then, a couple of weeks later, Jake's sister Emily had her birthday, and guess what? She got the same necklace too.

I know it's just a piece of jewelry, and it's not the end of the world, but it made me feel less special. It felt like the thought he put into my gift wasn't as personal or unique as I had believed. When I mentioned it to a close friend, she said I was overthinking it and that it was probably just a coincidence. But when I talked to my own sister about it, she agreed that it was a bit odd and could see why I felt put off.

I haven't brought this up with Jake yet because I don't want to seem ungrateful or petty. I genuinely love the necklace, and I know he put effort into choosing it. But at the same time, I can't shake this feeling of disappointment.

Jake's mom and Emily were thrilled with their gifts, and no one else seems to find it weird. They've both complimented me on my necklace, and we've shared a laugh about being ""necklace triplets."" Nothing about the situation seems to bother them, but here I am feeling conflicted.

I understand that he might have thought the necklace was perfect for all of us and wanted to give something beautiful to the women he cares about. Maybe I'm just reading too much into it, but it left me feeling a bit off.

So, AITA for feeling put off by being given the same gift as my boyfriend's mom and sister?","This is a throwaway.

I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for about a year now. His family and I are super close, and they all love me. Last week, we went to his family's annual holiday dinner, and I was really looking forward to spending the day with them. 

His mom and sister (23F) both gave me the same gift - a really nice kitchen appliance that I already have. I was surprised and a little confused when they gave it to me, but I didn't say anything. 

I felt really put off by it, and it kinda ruined the rest of the day for me. I couldn't help but think that they didn't put much thought into it, and it was just something generic that they got for everyone. It didn't help that his sister and I have a pretty close relationship, and I was expecting her to get me something a little more personal.

When we got home, I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he just shrugged it off, saying that they probably just got it for everyone in the family. He didn't seem to understand why it was a big deal to me, and it kinda felt like he was dismissing my feelings.

The thing is, I'm not expecting extravagant gifts or anything. I just felt like it was a thoughtless gesture, and it made me feel like I wasn't special to them. I know that's not fair, and I should probably just talk to them about it. But I'm feeling a little hurt and confused, and I'm not sure how to approach the situation. Am I the asshole for feeling put off by the gift, or did his family really just not think it through?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I\'ve been dating my boyfriend, Jake, for almost two years now.

13,AITA for scaring a worker at a Halloween haunted house?,"My girlfriend loves being scared. It's her thing. I'm not going to be all macho and pretend nothing scares me. Heights give me the heebie geebies.  So we went to a haunted house event. Not that crazy one where they actually torture you and you have to sign a forty page waiver, but it was still pretty extreme.

So the guy chasing us through the haunted house with a chainsaw wasn't scary.  To me.  My girlfriend was scared from the disorientation and the noise and the best really amazing costume.  But I played along. I let the actors chase us, I hid with her in a closet where the back falls away and there is a Japanese ghost girl in it. It was fun and my girlfriend was happy. When we got to the last room. The one where they take the picture of your group being scared, I didn't react to the thing that scares everyone else.  I won't spoil it but I can understand why it would scare people.    So we got out and we went to see the pictures and there we are a group of six people with five cowering in fear and me looking slightly interested at the way they pulled off the effect.    I told my girlfriend I was so scared I froze.    So anyway we go have a few drinks and some food at a pub down the way.  And on the way back to the car I saw one of the guys from the haunted house vaping in the alley.  So I walked up quietly behind him and whispered ""come here honey"" in a deep gravelly voice.

I was just joking but he jumped and knocked over some bottles that were on a ledge by him.  I apologized for my silly prank. But he looked pissed and the other actors got that I was joking and laughed.  I didn't touch him or anything. That would have been rude.    My girlfriend said I was an asshole for scaring him on his break.  I feel kind of bad about it but you would think a guy who does that for work would have a better sense of humor about being scared.

Kim no longer works in graphic design and graduated about a year ago with a masters in a different field.\n\nSo at dinner, Aiden brought up a podcast he listened to talking about a girl who signed a car lease for her new boyfriend.

We were all super excited and naturally, the atmosphere was electric with anticipation as we entered the creepy old mansion. The haunted house was known for its dedicated actors who would really commit to their roles, and honestly, that’s what made it so fun.

As we made our way through, we encountered one actor who was particularly convincing. He was dressed as a chainsaw-wielding zombie, complete with fake blood and a very creepy growl. My friends and I were having a blast, screaming and running in response to the scares. In a moment of playful mischief, I decided to prank this actor. I thought it would be hilarious if I pretended to scream in fear and then suddenly whipped out a fake chainsaw (which I had brought along for our Halloween costumes) and started revving it.

I was genuinely trying to be funny and thought it would be a fun interaction. However, the actor didn’t take it well at all. He dropped character and immediately got angry, telling me that I was ruining the experience for everyone. I was shocked and thought he was overreacting a bit. I mean, it’s a haunted house! I figured everyone would get a kick out of it.

After the haunted house, my friends had mixed reactions. Some thought it was funny and said I was just being playful, while others felt like I should have respected the actor's commitment to his role. The actor, on the other hand, was still visibly upset when we left, and I felt kind of bad seeing him out of character looking frustrated.

In the end, I felt like I had crossed a line when I was just trying to inject some fun into the situation. My friends are divided on whether I went too far or not, but I can’t stop thinking about it. So, am I the asshole for pranking a haunted house actor who was still in character?","This happened last weekend when my friends and I went to a popular haunted house attraction in our town. For context, I (25M) have a pretty close-knit group of friends who enjoy scary movies, haunted houses, and anything that gets our adrenaline pumping. Among us was my friend Sarah (24F), who absolutely loves pranks and always gets a kick out of them.

The haunted house we went to is known for having actors who stay in character no matter what. Halfway through the attraction, one of the actors, dressed as a creepy clown, jumped out and scared the living daylights out of us. We screamed and laughed, but this actor was particularly good and relentless, following us for several rooms.

We were all high on the adrenaline when I had the not-so-brilliant idea to prank him back. I noticed a rubber spider on one of the set pieces. I grabbed it and waited until the actor lunged at us again. When he did, I threw the spider at him and yelled, ""Behind you!"" thinking it'd be hilarious to catch him off guard for once. 

To my surprise, the actor didn't break character but started acting like he was genuinely freaked out by the spider. At first, we were all laughing, but the laughter quickly died down when he sternly told us to move along, clearly annoyed. The mood shifted, and it became apparent that I had crossed a line.

When we got out of the haunted house, some of my friends thought it was funny, but Sarah and a couple of others said I was being rude and disrespectful. Sarah pointed out that these actors work hard to provide a fun experience and that pranking them while they’re doing their job is not cool.

The actor's reaction stuck with me, and I started to feel guilty. I didn't mean to disrupt his performance or make him uncomfortable, but I guess I got carried away by the thrill of the moment. Now I'm worried I might have ruined the experience for everyone and disrespected the actor’s craft.

So, AITA for pranking a haunted house actor who was still in character?","Throwaway, because I'm still shaking with laughter. So, I'm at this haunted house attraction with my friends, and we're all excited to get scared. We get to the main room, and there's this actor dressed as a creepy old dude, just standing there staring at us. He's completely in character, and I have to admit, it's pretty effective. As we're walking by, I notice that he's wearing this ridiculously oversized pair of novelty sunglasses, and I just can't resist. I reach out and gently push the sunglasses up onto his forehead, right above his fake eyebrows. He doesn't flinch, just keeps staring at us with this deadpan expression. I'm thinking, ""This is going to be good.""

We all walk a little further, and I turn back to look at him, expecting him to crack a smile or something. But nope, he's still stone-faced. I'm dying laughing at this point, and I can tell my friends are too. We all sneak back over to him, trying not to make eye contact, and I give him a little nudge to make him blink. I swear, it's like he's a real zombie or something.

The other actors start to get suspicious, and they're like, ""Uh, what's going on here?"" One of them comes over and asks if we're okay, and I'm just trying to play it cool, like we're not pranking the dude at all. But my friends are all cracking up, and it's clear that we're all in on it.

The actor finally starts to break character, and he's like, ""Dude, what's going on? Why are you guys doing this?"" We all just shrug and say, ""Sorry, dude, we just couldn't resist."" The other actors are laughing too, and it's like this big joke now.

But as we're leaving, I notice that the creepy old dude is still looking at me with this weird, almost angry expression. I'm thinking, ""Oh, I might have taken it too far."" And then I see him whisper something to one of the other actors, who nods and gives me a dirty look. I'm starting to feel bad, but I'm also still laughing about it.

Would I be the asshole for pranking the haunted house actor who was still in character? I mean, it was just a joke, right?

For context, I (25M) have a pretty close-knit group of friends who enjoy scary movies, haunted houses, and anything that gets our adrenaline pumping. Among us was my friend Sarah (24F), who absolutely loves pranks and always gets a kick out of them.\n\nThe haunted house we went to is known for having actors who stay in character no matter what. Halfway through the attraction, one of the actors, dressed as a creepy clown, jumped out and scared the living daylights out of us. We screamed and laughed, but this actor was particularly good and relentless, following us for several rooms.\n\nWe were all high on the adrenaline when I had the not-so-brilliant idea to prank him back. I noticed a rubber spider on one of the set pieces. I grabbed it and waited until the actor lunged at us again. When he did, I threw the spider at him and yelled, ""Behind you!"" thinking it\'d be hilarious to catch him off guard for once. \n\nTo my surprise, the actor didn\'t break character but started acting like he was genuinely freaked out by the spider. At first, we were all laughing, but the laughter quickly died down when he sternly told us to move along, clearly annoyed. The mood shifted, and it became apparent that I had crossed a line.\n\nWhen we got out of the haunted house, some of my friends thought it was funny, but Sarah and a couple of others said I was being rude and disrespectful. Sarah pointed out that these actors work hard to provide a fun experience and that pranking them while they’re doing their job is not cool.\n\nThe actor\'s reaction stuck with me, and I started to feel guilty. I didn\'t mean to disrupt his performance or make him uncomfortable, but I guess I got carried away by the thrill of the moment. Now I\'m worried I might have ruined the experience for everyone and disrespected the actor’s craft.\n\nSo, AITA for pranking a haunted house actor who was still in character?'}]","{

My family has a big reunion planned at my house next month, and it's something we've all been looking forward to for ages. We usually have a great time catching up, eating good food, and just enjoying each other's company. 

Now, my cousin, who I've always been close to, has a service dog for her anxiety. She’s incredibly proud of it, and I totally understand the importance of service animals in helping people navigate their daily lives. However, my house is not exactly conducive to having a dog around. We have a lot of small children running around—my three kids, plus their cousins—and I worry about the dog being overwhelmed, getting scared, or worse, causing a situation that could endanger any of the kids. 

I initially wanted to be supportive and inclusive, so I asked my cousin about how the dog would fit into the family gathering. She assured me that the dog is well-trained and wouldn't be a problem. But then, I remembered that my youngest child is terrified of dogs. Like, unreasonably so. I thought it would be better to exclude the dog to keep everyone comfortable. 

So, a few weeks ago, I made the decision to send a message to my cousin letting her know that while I appreciate her and her service dog, I felt it would be best for everyone if the dog stayed home for this gathering. I thought I was doing the right thing by putting the needs of my family first. 

When I told my family about my decision, I expected support, but I was met with a mix of disapproval and disappointment. Some family members insisted that service dogs are meant to be with their owners and that excluding the dog was unfair and insensitive. Other relatives, who have seen my cousin's struggles, were more understanding but still felt I could have made an exception.

Now, my cousin is furious with me. She's saying that my decision not only affects her but also sends a message that her needs don’t matter to our family. I genuinely didn't mean to hurt her, and while I thought I was protecting my kids, it seems I've caused a major rift. 

I can understand that I might not have handled it the best way possible, but I still thought I had valid reasons for my decision. So, AITA for banning my cousin's service dog from our family event?","We recently had a big family reunion, something we do every couple of years. It's always a huge deal with everyone coming in from different states. This year, I volunteered to host at my place. Everything was going well until my cousin, Emily, said she'd be bringing her service dog, Max. 

Emily has severe anxiety and Max is trained specifically to help her manage it. I've known about her situation for a while, and while I sympathize, I've also been dealing with my own issues. Over the last year, I developed a pretty bad pet allergy. Even just being around dogs for a short amount of time can set off my allergies, leading to difficulty breathing, hives, and itching. 

So, when she mentioned bringing Max, I got really anxious. I didn't want to risk having an allergic reaction during the reunion. I called Emily and explained my situation, asking if she might be able to manage without Max just for the day. She was upset and said that Max is essential for her to even leave the house most days. I suggested she take some anti-anxiety meds instead, but she said they don't work as well and have side effects she doesn't want to deal with. 

Eventually, I told her that if she couldn't come without Max, then she might need to skip the reunion. Emily was furious and said I was being unreasonable and discriminatory. Some of my other family members felt the same and started messaging me, saying things like I could take allergy meds myself or stay outside if it got too bad. But for me, those aren't practical solutions. I didn't want to be uncomfortable in my own home.

The reunion went ahead without Emily, and it just didn't feel the same. A lot of family members were distant with me, and there was a clear tension in the air. I thought I was just trying to protect myself, but now I'm questioning if I went too far.

Was I an asshole for banning Emily's service dog from our family event?","My cousin is a veteran who suffers from PTSD and was awarded a service dog to help him cope with his anxiety and stress. The dog, a large German Shepherd named Max, is trained to sense when my cousin is on the verge of an episode and intervene by nipping at his leg or nudging him with his nose. It's been a huge help for my cousin and he's very attached to Max.

Recently, our family was planning a big summer BBQ to celebrate my grandmother's birthday. We were all excited to have the whole family together, including my cousin and Max. However, when my cousin mentioned that he was bringing Max, my sister got upset and said that she's afraid of dogs and didn't want Max at the event.

I tried to reason with my sister, explaining that Max is a service dog and that he's an essential part of my cousin's treatment. But my sister wouldn't budge, saying that she's ""afraid"" of dogs and that it's her right to refuse to let Max into her own home. I tried to compromise by suggesting that my cousin and Max stay in a separate area of the backyard, but my sister vetoed that idea too.

In the end, I banned Max from the event, citing ""allergies"" and ""insurance concerns"" as the reason. My cousin was devastated and felt like I was discriminating against him and his service dog. He's been hurt by my family's reaction and has since stopped attending family events.

I feel like I did what was necessary to avoid conflict with my sister, but at the same time, I'm worried that I may have hurt my cousin's feelings and damaged our relationship.

15,"AITA for uninviting my fiancée's parents to our wedding, because they refused to contribute financially?","Im sorry, I had to redo the post, because of a spelling mistake in the title.  Hello. This is a throwaway account. Im 38yo (M), my Fiancée Mary is 24 (F). We are going to get married in 2 months, and we have been dating for almost 2 years. The wedding planning has been expensive, and stressful. This is my second marriage, and in my first wedding, my (at the time) future in laws and my parents paid an equal financial percentage of the wedding. The arrangement was that me, my (at the time) partner, her parents and my parents would pay a quarter of the total cost.  So, this time, I was expecting a similar arrangement for this wedding. My current fiancée Mary agreed at first, but after speaking to her parents, they said that would not pay. My parents already paid their part, I gave my part, and my fiancée also paid her part, but her parents keep saying that they can't afford it (Tho, I know very well that they can afford it, they have some business and travel often).  Mary keeps saying that we should let it go, that we can cut costs or that she and her brothers will try to pay for her parents, but I've told her, multiple times already, that it is not fair to let them go free of charge, while my parents paid their part, and she agreed to this, and they should follow through. My parents also say that it is not fair to let only one set of parents to pay the percentage.  As Mary and her parents still insists in not paying, I decided to uninvite them. Mary was not happy about it, since she wants her dad to walk her to the altar, but I still try to make her see the situation from my point of view, but she is stubborn to just let them into the wedding for free, that it would be taken by my family as a sign of disrespect from her family.  She told me, ""if my mom and dad can't go, then I won't go either"" I told her to stop having a childish tantrum and just go along with our original agreement, but she is stubborn, and I wonder if this hill is worth dying on.",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Post: Im sorry, I had to redo the post, because of a spelling mistake in the title.

She's been taking is really hard, crying and staying in her bed all day for the past few days. My wife Carly (F52) and I (M50) have been doing our best to support her, but Sheila's been devastated. She hasn't told us why they broke up. Anyway, my other daughter Tory (F23) is coming home for the weekend from her college city, as it's her birthday. We were all planning on having a birthday dinner at Tory's favorite restaurant. Tory spent the entire summer in Seattle for an internship, so we haven't gotten to see her much this year. Thus, we cherish it whenever the family gets together.\n\nHowever, Shiela said that she wasn't feeling up for the birthday dinner due to her being depressed over the breakup. She also said she's gonna need a long time to recover, and that Tory already said she was fine with Shiela skipping the dinner to recover. I told Shiela I'm doing my best to be empathetic, but we all don't get to see Tory often. I said I understood the breakup was painful, but she wasn't ever gonna feel better until she eventually got out of bed. If anything, I said seeing her sister again could probably put her in a better mood. Shiela said again that Tory was fine with it, and Carly mentioned that she could've been lying to avoid hurting Shiela. Shiela lashed out and accused us both of being selfish. I said that we could talk about this in a civil manner, but Shiela told me the breakup was still fresh and needed to mourn the last two years of love. I said I understood that, but it would just be really nice to get the family all together to have some fun. Shiela lashed out and told me to stop changing her mind. I said again that she WAS going to the dinner, and Shiela stormed up to her room.\n\nIt's been an hour, and Shiela hasn't come out of her room. I've been downstairs thinking about all this. Carly said both Shiela and I were being a bit close-minded, but I'm starting to wonder if I fucked up. AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Uninviting My Fiancée's Parents From Our Wedding Over a Money Dispute?'""}]","I (M30) am engaged to my fiancée Emily (F28), and we’ve been planning our wedding for the past few months. We both come from different financial backgrounds; my family is relatively well-off, while Emily's parents have struggled financially for most of their lives. We decided early on that we wanted to cover the majority of the costs ourselves, wanting to keep things simple and affordable. However, as we got deeper into planning, things started to get complicated.

Emily’s parents offered to help with some costs, which we greatly appreciated. However, as they began contributing, they started throwing around ideas of what they wanted, like an extravagant venue that was way out of our budget and certain costly additions that neither of us wanted. Throughout the discussions, I tried to maintain a balance, but it was becoming increasingly clear that they had a vision that didn’t align with ours.

The tipping point came when Emily's mom insisted that we host a lavish rehearsal dinner, despite us having already planned a simple gathering. In frustration, I finally told her that we simply couldn’t accommodate that sort of expense and that we needed to stick to our original budget. She became defensive, claiming we were being ungrateful for their financial support. In my anger, I said I’d rather cover everything myself and uninvited her and her husband from the wedding altogether.

Emily was devastated by my decision. She felt that I had overreacted and that her parents’ intentions were good. I thought I was standing up for what we wanted, but now I’m starting to feel guilty. Our wedding is supposed to be a celebration of our love, not a battleground for disputes over money. 

After talking to a few friends, some said I was justified in wanting to take complete control of our wedding, while others believed I was being insensitive and rash in uninviting them. Emily is caught in the middle, and our relationship feels strained. I can’t shake off the feeling that maybe I went too far. AITA for uninviting my fiancée’s parents from our wedding over a money dispute?","My fiancée, Emily (F28), and I (M30) are getting married in a few months. We've been planning this wedding for over a year, and everything has been mostly smooth sailing until recently. Emily's parents, John (M55) and Carol (F53), have always been supportive of our relationship and offered to contribute financially to the wedding. They generously offered to cover the cost of the catering, which we were very grateful for.

However, last week, John and Carol called us for a serious discussion. They explained that due to some unexpected financial difficulties, they wouldn’t be able to cover the catering expenses anymore. They were very apologetic, but they simply couldn't swing it. I was upset, but I tried to stay calm and told them I understood. Emily was more understanding and suggested we could look for cheaper catering options or scale back the guest list to fit our budget.

I felt that John and Carol should still honor their commitment. After all, we had planned our budget based on their promise. I asked them if they could at least contribute a smaller amount, but they said things were really tight right now and they couldn't commit to anything financially. I felt let down and frustrated. I ended up snapping and told them that if they couldn't support us as they promised, they didn't need to come to the wedding at all.

Emily was horrified by my outburst and immediately tried to calm the situation, but the damage was done. John and Carol left, clearly hurt by my reaction. Since then, Emily and I have been arguing constantly. She thinks I overreacted and that uninviting her parents was a drastic and unnecessary step. She pointed out that they have always been supportive in other ways and that we should empathize with their situation.

Our friends and my family are divided on the issue. My parents think I was right to stand my ground because a promise is a promise. However, many of our friends, and even my sister, think I was way out of line and should apologize. Emily has been distant, and it’s causing a strain on our relationship.

Now, I'm stuck in a mess of my own making. While I still feel hurt and betrayed, I can't ignore the fact that my reaction has greatly impacted everyone involved, especially Emily. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for uninviting my fiancée's parents from our wedding over a money dispute?","I (M26) am getting married in 2 months to my fiancée (F25). We're having a small, intimate ceremony at a beautiful vineyard in the countryside, with around 50 close friends and family. The venue costs $6,000, and we're already on a tight budget. My fiancée's parents (M60/F58) have been somewhat distant since the beginning of our relationship, but we've always tried to keep things civil for her sake.

However, a few weeks ago, they asked if they could cover the cost of the venue, which they claimed would be around $2,000. We politely declined, explaining that we'd already allocated our budget for the wedding and couldn't afford the extra expense. But then, a few days ago, we received an email from them saying that they'd ""reconsidered"" their offer and were now willing to pay for the venue after all - but only if we agreed to let them give a 10-minute speech during the ceremony. We felt uncomfortable with the sudden change of heart and the expectation of a lengthy speech, which would take away from our own vows and the ceremony.

We politely declined their offer again, explaining that we'd already made other arrangements for the ceremony and didn't feel it was fair to change the plans at the last minute. I also made it clear that we valued our own vows and the ceremony, and didn't want to compromise on that. My fiancée was a bit upset that we'd had to turn them down, but she understood our perspective.

However, a few days later, my fiancée's mom sent me a scathing email, calling me ""cheap"" and ""selfish"" for not accepting their offer. She said that they'd been looking forward to giving a speech and that we were being ""ungrateful"" for their generosity. My fiancée was really upset by the email and felt that her mom was being unfair.

In response, I sent a calm and polite email explaining that we'd made our decision based on our own budget and priorities, and that we valued our own vows and the ceremony more than any potential benefit from their offer. I also made it clear that we appreciated their enthusiasm, but couldn't change the plans at the last minute.

However, things escalated further when my fiancée's mom sent another email, this time saying that she and her husband wouldn't be attending the wedding if we didn't change our minds. I felt that this was an ultimatum and that they were trying to bully us into accepting their terms. I responded by sending an email saying that we valued their relationship and didn't want to have any drama or tension at the wedding, but that we couldn't change our minds on this.

And that's when I decided to take a stand. I sent an email to my fiancée's parents saying that we appreciated their interest in attending the wedding, but that we couldn't invite them if they were going to make demands and ultimatums. I explained that we valued their relationship, but that we needed to prioritize our own needs and preferences for the wedding.

My fiancée was a bit surprised by my decision, but she ultimately agreed that it was the right thing to do. We've decided not to invite her parents to the wedding, and we're moving forward with the original plans.

My husband also has a son (8M) from a previous relationship, and while the dynamic has been pretty smooth, I’ve often felt like there's an underlying tension due to his co-parent (let’s call her “Sarah""). 

Sarah and my husband have a complicated history, and while I respect their co-parenting relationship, I can't deny that it sometimes feels like she has a strong influence in our lives. Recently, I learned that Sarah is pregnant with her new partner. Initially, I thought I would just brush it off, but as the news sank in, I found myself feeling upset about it. 

After that, I came across some beautiful matching earrings for both our daughter and her half-brother, and I thought it'd be a lovely way to celebrate their bond. I pictured them wearing those earrings during family events and felt like it would help strengthen their connection. I ended up buying them without discussing it with my husband first. 

When I showed them to him, he was taken aback. He said he thought it was ""inappropriate"" to buy matching jewelry for our daughter and her half-brother when Sarah is pregnant with another child. To him, it felt like I was trying to overshadow that part of their family. I felt hurt and misunderstood; all I wanted was to create a sweet connection between our kids.

In the heat of the moment, he reminded me that our daughter also has a half-sister on the way, and I shot back that those earrings were meant to celebrate her bond with her brother and shouldn't feel like a competition. It escalated into a bigger argument about how we both view the kids’ relationship and what this new pregnancy means for us as a blended family.

Now, both of us are feeling frustrated. I can’t help but feel that my intentions were good, and maybe he was overreacting. But at the same time, I recognize that perhaps I should have discussed it with him first. My friends say I should stand my ground and that my husband is being too sensitive, while his family suggests I should've considered his feelings more. 

So here I am wondering: AITA for being upset about my husband’s co-parent's pregnancy and for buying matching earrings for our child?","My husband, Mark, and I have been married for five years. He has a daughter, Emma (6), from a previous relationship with his co-parent, Lisa. I've always tried to be supportive and respectful of their co-parenting dynamic, but sometimes it feels like my feelings are sidelined.

Recently, Lisa announced that she was pregnant. Apparently, she and her new partner decided to expand their family. When Mark told me, it felt like a punch to the gut. I wasn't mad that she was pregnant, but it stirred up old insecurities. I know it's irrational, but I've always felt a bit threatened by the close bond that Mark, Lisa, and Emma share. It’s like they have this little unit that I’m on the outskirts of, and this new baby amplified that feeling.

In an attempt to bond with Emma and make her feel special amidst all these changes, I bought us matching earrings. Emma was thrilled, and for a moment, it felt like a win. But when Lisa saw the earrings, she was livid. Apparently, she thought it was inappropriate for me to buy something so personal and matching without consulting her first. She felt it was overstepping, asserting that she should be the one doing “firsts” with Emma, like matching jewelry.

Mark took her side, saying he understood where she was coming from and that I should’ve checked with Lisa first. I was frustrated. All I wanted was to make Emma feel special and to have a bonding moment with her. Why should Lisa get to dictate every special moment with Emma?

My friends are divided. Some say I should’ve known better and that Lisa has a right to feel upset, while others think Lisa is being overly sensitive and that I did nothing wrong by trying to connect with my stepdaughter.

The situation has caused a lot of tension. Mark and I had a big argument about it. He thinks I'm not considering Lisa's feelings, while I feel like my efforts to connect with Emma are constantly being scrutinized and undermined. Now, I’m left questioning my actions. Should I have handled this differently?

Am I the asshole for being upset about Lisa's pregnancy and for buying matching earrings for Emma without consulting her?","My husband and I have a great co-parenting relationship with his ex-girlfriend, who I'll call 'Sarah'. We're all on the same page when it comes to our child's needs and well-being. However, things got complicated when Sarah announced she was pregnant again.

We had a conversation with Sarah about our child's reaction to the new baby, and we all agreed it would be best to be honest and open with them about the situation. We also decided that we wouldn't get matching clothes or accessories for our child with Sarah's new baby.

However, yesterday, I found out that Sarah had bought matching earrings for our child and her new baby. I was taken aback and felt a bit disrespected that she would go behind our backs and do something like that. I felt like it was a way of saying, 'Hey, you're not the only parent in this kid's life.'

When I confronted Sarah about it, she said she just thought it would be cute and didn't mean to upset me. She claimed that she was trying to create a special bond between the two kids and that we were being too sensitive.

My husband, on the other hand, thinks I'm being ridiculous and that it's just a harmless gesture. He says that I'm overreacting and that we should just let it go. Sarah's new partner even chimed in and said that I was being too controlling and that we should just let the kids have fun with the matching earrings.

I'm still feeling upset about the situation and feel like Sarah crossed a boundary by going behind our backs and doing something that we specifically discussed we wouldn't do.

Mark and I had a big argument about it. He thinks I'm not considering Lisa's feelings, while I feel like my efforts to connect with Emma are constantly being scrutinized and undermined. Now, I’m left questioning my actions. Should I have handled this differently?\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset about Lisa's pregnancy and for buying matching earrings for Emma without consulting her?""}]","{

17,AITA for not helping with the kids?,"My wife and I have a sort of tag in tag out system with the kids. We like to alternate, especially during big events, so we both get breaks. For example, every year for Halloween one of us takes the kids trick or treating while the other chills out at home and then when we get back the home parent is on duty and the trick or treating parent gets a break.  Last year my wife took the kids trick or treating, so this year I did. It was pretty tiring. The five year old got tired and wanted to be carried, while the nine year old kept running ahead and needing to be chased. When I got home I was ready to take a shower and lay in bed reading my book. My legs hurt and I felt old AF.  My wife came in our room and said the boys were fighting and asked if I could talk to our nine year old while she deals with our younger boy. I said I needed a break before bedtime started (because that's a two person job). She said she needed my help. I said it was her turn. She said it wouldn't take long. I said I was tired.  She got mad and said ""go to sleep then."" She shut the light out as she walked out even though she knew I was reading. She didn't talk to me the whole time we were getting the kids ready for bed. After, I told her it felt unfair that I never disturb her off duty time but she always wants to tag me in for emergencies that aren't emergencies. Light arguing (that wasn't even loud enough to carry down the hall) isn't a huge deal.  She said a parent is never off duty, but she got to be off duty for two hours while I was out with the kids. She said if I called her to come help, she would have, but I wouldn't have because I respect her down time and know she needs breaks from the kids.

I work in a demanding job, and while I usually try to help out around the house and with family responsibilities, there are times when I just need to recharge. 

My wife, on the other hand, has a more flexible schedule and often does a lot of the household chores and caring for our young kids during the day. Lately, whenever I’m relaxing at home on the weekends—like watching a game, catching up on my favorite shows, or even napping—she’ll interrupt me to ask for help with various things. This could be anything from doing chores, helping with the kids, or running errands. When I politely tell her I need some time to myself, she gets upset and accuses me of being lazy or not being a team player.

In contrast, when she has her off time, she fully embraces it. She goes out with her friends or locks herself in the bedroom to binge-watch shows, but if I were to interrupt her with responsibilities, she would turn me down flat, insisting she’s “off-duty” and can’t be disturbed. I’ve brought up how I feel it’s unfair that she expects me to put my time aside while she takes hers for granted, but she insists that her time off needs to be respected because she handles so much during the week.

My friends have mixed opinions about it. Some argue that I should just help out when I can, especially since she often does more around the house. Others think I deserve my downtime and that she needs to understand my need for rest too.

Overall, our disagreements have led to tension between us, and it often ends with her feeling unappreciated. I’m starting to feel that maybe I’m not being fair, even though I feel justified in wanting my time back. 

So, AITA for expecting my wife to respect my “off-duty” time when I don’t feel she does the same for me?","I (34M) work a high-stress job and often find myself completely drained by the end of the day. My wife, Sarah (32F), has a part-time job and also takes care of our two young children, ages 4 and 2. We’ve always agreed that evenings are supposed to be our “off-duty” time where we can unwind and take a breather.

Recently, I’ve found myself needing more space and quiet during my “off-duty” time. Sometimes, I retreat to my home office to play video games or read, just to decompress. When I do this, Sarah continues to handle the kids and household tasks. She’s never complained outright, but she’s been noticeably cold and distant whenever I emerge from my “me-time.”

Last week, I came home particularly exhausted and told her I needed a break. I shut myself in my office for a few hours. When I came out, I found Sarah looking frazzled, trying to juggle the kids’ bedtime routine and finish cleaning up the kitchen. I felt guilty so I offered to help, but she brushed me off, saying she had it under control.

A couple of days later, Sarah had a particularly tough day at work and with the kids. She asked if she could have some time to herself in the evening. I was in the middle of an intense online game and told her to wait until I was done. I figured it wouldn’t take long, but I lost track of time and by the time I was done, she looked about ready to collapse.

My parents visited last weekend, and I mentioned how I’ve been needing more downtime. They suggested that I make sure to reciprocate and give Sarah her own “off-duty” time. When I told them I’m already doing enough by providing for the family, they looked at me like I had two heads.

Sarah’s been giving me the cold shoulder ever since, and now I’m starting to wonder if she’s right to be upset. I thought we had an understanding about our “off-duty” time, but maybe I haven’t been fair in my expectations.

So, AITA for expecting my wife to respect my “off-duty” time when I won’t do the same for her?","I (38M) have been married to my wife (35F) for 10 years, and we have two kids together. We've always been a pretty loving and supportive couple, but lately, things have gotten a bit out of balance. My wife works as a nurse and often comes home from long shifts feeling exhausted. She's been asking me to respect her ""off-duty"" time and not to call or text her unless it's absolutely necessary.

The problem is, I have a high-stress job as a lawyer and I also have a side hustle as a freelance writer. Sometimes I get work emails or phone calls that require my immediate attention, even when I'm not on the clock. My wife understands that, but she expects me to shut off work mode when I'm at home. She's been pretty vocal about it, saying that she needs me to be present and focused on our family during those times.

However, I don't do the same for her. If she gets a call from her hospital or has to deal with a difficult patient, she expects me to be available to talk about it and offer support. I've tried to explain to her that my work is different from hers, but she just says that I need to learn to prioritize our family and turn off work mode.

Lately, I've started to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I'm always expected to be available to her, but she's not willing to make the same accommodations for me. I've started to resent it and feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her, never knowing when she'll need something from me. I've tried talking to her about it, but she just gets defensive and says that I'm being selfish.

The other day, I got a call from a potential client during dinner and I had to take it. My wife was upset that I didn't put my phone on silent mode, but when I explained the situation to her, she just rolled her eyes and said that I should have made time for her. I felt like I was being treated unfairly and that's when I realized that I'm expecting her to respect my ""off-duty"" time, but I'm not doing the same for her.

18,AITA for asking my Dad for more in his will?,"My father is preparing his will and asked for my opinion on how he will organize it. He is wealthy, and he owns property in two different places, one house is much bigger than the other, worth about 3.5x as much.  He also has a couple million in stocks. I have one sibling, she has a husband and two kids. I have a spouse, but don’t have kids. Both my sister and I are in our 40’s. It is unlikely I will ever have kids. My sister and I both do ok right now, but neither of us are rich in our own right.   He wants to leave the bigger house to my sister because he wants that property to eventually go to his grandkids. I am fine with that, but (since he asked) I am asking that he find a way to make it more even somewhere else. He seems to be reluctant to do this because I think he’s afraid that there might not be enough stock/cash to do that. However, he has done a lot more for her already, for example funding the grandkids college educations, buying them both cars etc. He has been very generous to me and my spouse too, but less so simply because we don’t have kids to spoil.   Also worth noting, in my will, half of all my assets will go to my sisters kids, and the other half will go to my spouse’s sister’s kids. If my spouse and I die tomorrow, each of our nieces/nephews would get several hundred thousand dollars each just from us.   I am ok with my sister getting a little more than me, but also see it as a judgment on me and my life, and I don’t think she should get everything just handed to her at my expense. She has thrown salt in the wound by referring to the bigger house as “hers” for years, joking that she is my parent’s favorite, and bad mouthing me to our family, damaging my relationship with them, especially my niece/nephew.   I know this sounds petty and selfish, and it is. But it’s also the kind of resentment that splits families apart.

We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :\n\n“i have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.”\n\nI was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)\n\nI guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me. I often mimic people’s personality and humor to fit with them, so after we had been friends for so long we were practically the same person. everyone said that, even our moms. So i thought that since my jokes were basically hers, everything was fine. So am I the asshole?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Complaining About My Father Favoring My Sister in the Will?'""}]","Growing up, it was no secret that my father had a favorite: my younger sister. While I (24M) had always tried to brush it off and convince myself it didn’t bother me, it became more and more evident over the years. She could do no wrong in his eyes, while I often felt like I was the one constantly seeking validation and acknowledgment. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when my father announced he was updating his will. I assumed it would be a fair division or at least some consideration for everything I've done for him over the years. I’m the one who helped him with household repairs, organized events, and generally supported him when he needed someone. But when he revealed the details, I was stunned to find that my sister was set to receive the majority of his inheritance, with me getting a fraction of what she would receive.

Feeling hurt and frustrated, I confronted my father about it. I expressed how I felt that this favoritism was unfair and that I had always been there for him while my sister had not put in the same effort. My father responded defensively, saying that he was doing what he thought was best and that it was his money to distribute as he wished. He accused me of being greedy and ungrateful. It felt like a slap in the face, and I couldn’t help but voice my displeasure.

Now, my father is angry with me, and my sister feels awkward because she overheard our argument. The rest of my family is divided; some sympathize with me, saying it’s natural to feel hurt, while others think I should have kept my mouth shut and just accepted my father's decision gracefully. 

In the aftermath, I feel guilty about how I reacted but also like I have a point. I don’t want to come off as selfish, but it stings to feel sidelined my entire life, only to have that reflected in something as significant as our father's will. 

So, AITA for expressing my feelings about my father favoring my sister in the will?","My father (late 60s) recently passed away, and the reading of his will has stirred up some serious family drama. For context, it's just me (M 35) and my younger sister (F 32). Growing up, we never really had a lot of sibling rivalry, and my dad always seemed to treat us equally - or so I thought. My father owned a small but lucrative business, which he built from the ground up over many years. I work in a completely different field and have never shown any interest in the family business. My sister, however, has been involved in the company since she graduated college and has played a significant role in expanding it.

The will revealed that my father left the business entirely to my sister and split the remaining assets (the house, savings, etc.) equally between us. I felt blindsided and hurt. I confronted my sister, saying it wasn’t fair that she got such a significant portion of his estate while I only got half of the rest. She tried to explain that our father wanted the business to stay in the family and felt she was the natural choice to take over since she’s been managing it for years.

I brought this up with our mother and a few close relatives. Most of them sided with my sister, agreeing that it made sense for her to inherit the business. They pointed out that I have a good job, a stable income, and that my sister worked hard alongside our dad to make the business what it is today. My mother said she understood my feelings but urged me to see it from a practical standpoint.

This has caused some tension between my sister and me. We used to be close, but now things feel strained. She’s frustrated that I’m making this into a big issue and thinks I’m being unfair given the circumstances. I still feel overlooked and undervalued - I’m his son too, after all. The rest of the family thinks I should just accept it and move on, but I can't shake the feeling of being slighted.

Am I the asshole for complaining about my father favoring my sister in the will?","I'm 28 and my sister is 25. We both live with our 60-year-old father, who has been in poor health for the past few years. Our mother passed away when we were young. My sister has always been more emotionally dependent on dad, often calling him multiple times a day and expecting him to drop everything to help her. I've had my own life, a job, and a partner, but I've also been very involved in caring for dad.

When dad's health took a turn for the worse, my sister started making more demands on him, asking for money to pay off her debts and loans. Dad, being the kind and loving father he is, would often give in to her requests. However, he's also told me that he's been planning to leave me a larger inheritance, as he knows I've been taking care of him and managing the household.

The problem is that dad has recently changed his will, leaving almost everything to my sister, including the family home. I was shocked and hurt when he told me about it, especially considering all the sacrifices I've made for him. My sister claims that she's going to take care of dad's medical bills and expenses, but I know she's not capable of handling the financial responsibilities that come with managing the household.

I've been trying to talk to dad about it, but he just says that he wants to make sure my sister is taken care of. I've tried to explain to him that I've been there for him all these years, but he just gets defensive and says I'm being selfish. I'm starting to feel like I'm being punished for being responsible and independent.

My partner thinks I'm being unreasonable and that I should just accept dad's decision. But I feel like I'm being screwed over and that dad is favoring my sister out of guilt or obligation. I've always been a good son, and I feel like I deserve to be treated fairly.

19,AITA for making my (22F) boyfriend's (27M) mother biscuits?,"Long story short, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and, days ago, I finally got to meet his parents (actually, his dad and stepmom, but he considers her as his mom and calls her so), and, as a nice personal gesture, as I love to cook, I decided to bake a batch of biscuits. I met up with his parents, they loved me and I loved them, I gave them the biscuits and they loved the attention, but here's the thing : my boyfriend's parents have been separated for decades now, because of a very sad story that tore their family apart (my bf's bio mom cheated on his dad) and even though he denies it, and doesn't show it, he still resents her for it. Word travels lightning fast in our small town, and she found out that I met up with my bf's dad and stepmom, and she was apparently quite saddened by the news, but understands. I told my boyfriend that it was only fair that we'd meet up with her as well and he said okay. I told him I'd make biscuits for her too, and he already seemed not to like the idea...The day before meeting up, my boyfriend enters the kitchen and sees me baking the same biscuits I gave his dad and stepmom earlier, but for his mom, this time. He asks what I'm doing, I tell him, and he goes ""You're really doing that? Why are you going through that pain, it's not worth it"", I tell him he's being weird and there's no reason I wouldn't treat his mom the way I did his dad and stepmom and he just leaves the room. While we get ready to leave, he tells me to leave the biscuits at home, that she won't like them anyway, that there's no reason, so I confront him and ask him why a simple nice gesture for her is too much to him. He pretends not to understand, I cave, because I don't want it to become a full blown argument. We have a lovely time with his mom, then we go home...My bf's not a fan of sugar and I made a full batch, so about 30 biscuits...Yesterday, his mom passed by to say hi because she was running errands on our side of the town while he was at work. It was thirty seconds, I gave her the biscuits because I didn't want them to go to waste. My bf found out because she complimented them to him on the phone, and now he's mad. This is ridiculous to me, childish even, and it makes no sense. I think he still hasn't forgiven her for the trauma of his parents' divorce (it was very tough on him, the other he was telling me about how it ""ruined his life"" because the guy his mom left his dad for was a PoS and basically made his life a living hell for a decade and he still remembers the day his parents sat him down to tell him it was over), but he also talks with her on the phone at least once a week and is very sweet to her, never a bad word...He's cold with me now and refuses to admit there is something wrong...Am I the asshole for just wanting to treat his parents equally?",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Post: Long story short, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and, days ago, I finally got to meet his parents (actually, his dad and stepmom, but he considers her as his mom and calls her so), and, as a nice personal gesture, as I love to cook, I decided to bake a batch of biscuits.

Things have been going really well, and we’ve even started discussing moving in together. However, one significant hurdle has been Jake's relationship with his mother, who has a rocky past, especially with Jake. 

Jake's mom, Susan, cheated on his dad when he was a child, and it has caused a lot of pain for Jake and his family. They have a strained relationship, and while Jake has somewhat forgiven her, he still has a lot of resentment. For the most part, he doesn’t involve her in the major milestones of his life, and I’ve respected his wishes.

Recently, it was Jake’s birthday, and I wanted to surprise him with an amazing gift. I had learned that Susan had also planned to send him something right around the same time. To keep things balanced and make a statement, I thought it might be nice to send Susan a small gift as well, as a way to mend the bridge a little. 

I bought her a lovely plant and a handwritten note, expressing that I hoped she was doing well and that ""someday, maybe they could work on their relationship."" I thought this would show a sense of goodwill, and I wanted to treat her equally, given that all families come with their own baggage.

When Jake found out, he was furious. He felt that I was undermining his feelings about his mother and that this was inappropriate given her past actions. He said that I was being naïve and didn’t understand the depth of their issues. After our argument, he ended up telling me that I was disrespecting his family by trying to “normalize” his mother’s behavior.

Now, I’m second-guessing myself. I genuinely thought it was a kind gesture and a way to show that I care about both of them. But Jake’s reaction made me wonder if I overstepped. Am I the asshole for trying to treat my boyfriend's cheating mother equally by giving her gifts?","So, my boyfriend (25M) and I (24F) have been together for three years now. We decided to move in together last year, and things have been mostly great. The only real issue in our relationship has been his mother. She never liked me from the beginning, always making passive-aggressive comments and undermining our relationship.

A little background: My boyfriend’s parents separated when he was a teenager because his mother cheated on his father. This caused a lot of tension within the family, but my boyfriend has tried to maintain a relationship with both of his parents. His father remarried and moved on, while his mother has remained single and somewhat bitter.

For my boyfriend’s birthday this year, I decided to give gifts to both of his parents as a gesture of goodwill. I thought it would help smooth things over with his mother and show her that I want to be part of their family. I spent quite a bit of time picking out thoughtful presents: a nice watch for his father and a beautiful handmade scarf for his mother. I even included a heartfelt note with each gift.

When my boyfriend’s mother received her gift, she was furious. She accused me of trying to buy her forgiveness and manipulate my way into the family. She said she found my gesture insulting and disrespectful given the history of her infidelity. She also took to social media to vent her frustrations, which made the whole situation public and incredibly awkward.

My boyfriend was caught in the middle, and while he appreciated my effort, he said I should have known better than to try and “balance the scales” with his mother. He thinks my actions were well-intentioned but ultimately misguided and insensitive.

Most of our friends and family agree with my boyfriend, saying that my gesture was tone-deaf considering the history between his parents. But a small group of my close friends believe I was just trying to be kind and that his mother overreacted.

Since then, my relationship with his mother has deteriorated even further, and it’s causing tension between my boyfriend and me. I genuinely thought I was doing something nice, but now I’m questioning if I went about it the wrong way. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to treat my boyfriend’s cheating mother equally by giving her gifts?","I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for about 2 years now. We're in a long-distance relationship, and I've been making an effort to be as understanding as possible, considering his complicated family situation. His mom, who I'll call Karen, has been a huge part of our relationship. However, there's a bit of a problem: she's cheated on his dad not once, not twice, but multiple times. It's a topic that's very sensitive for my boyfriend, and he's been working through his feelings about it with me.

Karen reached out to me a few months ago, and I decided to give her a chance, despite knowing about her infidelity. I figured that if my boyfriend was willing to work on his feelings, I could try to be understanding and empathetic towards her. I started small by sending her a birthday card and a small gift. However, things escalated quickly, and I found myself buying her gifts and spending money on her just to show my boyfriend that I was trying to be supportive.

The problem is that my boyfriend's dad, who I've met a few times, is a really kind and genuine person. He's always been very welcoming to me, and I feel like he deserves so much better than to be cheated on by his wife. On the other hand, Karen seems to be taking advantage of my efforts to be kind to her. She's always making requests for money or gifts, and she doesn't even bother to thank me or show any appreciation.

Recently, I found out that Karen has been lying to me about her relationship with her husband, telling me that they're on the mend when, in reality, they're still in counseling. I felt betrayed and hurt by her actions, but my boyfriend is still trying to make excuses for her. He says that I should just be patient and understanding, that Karen is ""trying her best.""

That's when I realized that I was trying too hard to treat Karen equally to my boyfriend. I started questioning why I was putting so much effort into being kind to someone who doesn't even deserve it. It's like I'm enabling her behavior and ignoring the pain she's caused my boyfriend's dad.

Now I'm feeling torn. Part of me wants to just cut ties with Karen and be done with it, but another part of me feels like I owe it to my boyfriend to try and be understanding. But honestly, I think I was just being a fool for trying to treat her equally. Am I the asshole for trying to give her gifts and make her feel included, when it's clear that she's not deserving of it?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'So, my boyfriend (25M) and I (24F) have been together for three years now. We decided to move in together last year, and things have been mostly great. The only real issue in our relationship has been his mother. She never liked me from the beginning, always making passive-aggressive comments and undermining our relationship.\n\nA little background: My boyfriend’s parents separated when he was a teenager because his mother cheated on his father. This caused a lot of tension within the family, but my boyfriend has tried to maintain a relationship with both of his parents. His father remarried and moved on, while his mother has remained single and somewhat bitter.\n\nFor my boyfriend’s birthday this year, I decided to give gifts to both of his parents as a gesture of goodwill. I thought it would help smooth things over with his mother and show her that I want to be part of their family. I spent quite a bit of time picking out thoughtful presents: a nice watch for his father and a beautiful handmade scarf for his mother. I even included a heartfelt note with each gift.\n\nWhen my boyfriend’s mother received her gift, she was furious. She accused me of trying to buy her forgiveness and manipulate my way into the family. She said she found my gesture insulting and disrespectful given the history of her infidelity. She also took to social media to vent her frustrations, which made the whole situation public and incredibly awkward.\n\nMy boyfriend was caught in the middle, and while he appreciated my effort, he said I should have known better than to try and “balance the scales” with his mother. He thinks my actions were well-intentioned but ultimately misguided and insensitive.\n\nMost of our friends and family agree with my boyfriend, saying that my gesture was tone-deaf considering the history between his parents. But a small group of my close friends believe I was just trying to be kind and that his mother overreacted.\n\nSince then, my relationship with his mother has deteriorated even further, and it’s causing tension between my boyfriend and me. I genuinely thought I was doing something nice, but now I’m questioning if I went about it the wrong way. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for trying to treat my boyfriend’s cheating mother equally by giving her gifts?'}]","{

20,AITA for refusing to sit with my partner?,"throwaway, etc.  I live with two roommates and my partner, Fred. We have been having a fair amount of on and off tension with one of the roommates, Amy. Amy, who I do care about a lot, has a long trauma history and can be very combative and argumentative when she's feeling defensive. Honestly a generally argumentative person. Fred and Amy have been in the majority of the conflict-- while they share a lot of common interests and views, they bring out the worst in each other and there's been a lot of discontent that they've worked to resolve and set aside.  On to tonight: Amy, Fred and I were headed out to an event and were planning to meet our other roommate there. On the way, Fred and Amy get into an argument about how rent is paid (we all venmo Fred and then he pays our landlord. He is asking for the venmo to be sent a few days prior to the 1st of the month so he can send rent on time. Amy is resistant to this and doesn't want to elaborate further.)  I could give you a play by play of the exact argument, but I think it's safe to say neither handled it well and it escalated quickly to yelling and vitriol. I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story. I asked them both to be quiet and essentially said: I can see there's a miscommunication, it's not appropriate or productive to keep yelling mean things so knock it off. They were both eventually able to stop and don't speak for the rest of the ride.  He drops us off and parks the car. They don't speak in line but both speak with me normally. When we're settled, he says he doesn't want to sit by Amy and goes off to sit by himself, indicating I should go with him.  Here's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: I had set up the blanket and we were expecting our friends. I felt like it was an escalation to take a stand and go sit alone with Fred rather than for Amy and Fred to continue to keep distance and resolve at a later time. While it was super clear that Amy started the original rent issue by refusing to communicate, neither handled it well and I was upset with both of them.  I went off to call a friend and vent. Fred came up to me and insisted I go sit with him or he was going to leave and take the car with him, leaving Amy and I to find our own way home. He said he wouldn't tolerate being treated like this (a common feeling he has about Amy) and needed me to take a stand with him. I felt like he was putting me between a rock and a hard place. I told him explicitly, repeatedly, that I agreed with him, side with him, know it's wrong, and just don't agree with his actions handling it after the fact. I think he felt betrayed and like I wasn't taking his side.  I was able to convince him to leave me the car because I felt that was kind of rude, and he went home on his own. Now he isn't speaking to me and is extremely upset-- more than usual, and I'm wondering if I read the whole situation wrong.

We have been having a fair amount of on and off tension with one of the roommates, Amy. Amy, who I do care about a lot, has a long trauma history and can be very combative and argumentative when she's feeling defensive. Honestly a generally argumentative person. Fred and Amy have been in the majority of the conflict-- while they share a lot of common interests and views, they bring out the worst in each other and there's been a lot of discontent that they've worked to resolve and set aside.  On to tonight: Amy, Fred and I were headed out to an event and were planning to meet our other roommate there. On the way, Fred and Amy get into an argument about how rent is paid (we all venmo Fred and then he pays our landlord. He is asking for the venmo to be sent a few days prior to the 1st of the month so he can send rent on time. Amy is resistant to this and doesn't want to elaborate further.)  I could give you a play by play of the exact argument, but I think it's safe to say neither handled it well and it escalated quickly to yelling and vitriol. I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story. I asked them both to be quiet and essentially said: I can see there's a miscommunication, it's not appropriate or productive to keep yelling mean things so knock it off. They were both eventually able to stop and don't speak for the rest of the ride.  He drops us off and parks the car. They don't speak in line but both speak with me normally. When we're settled, he says he doesn't want to sit by Amy and goes off to sit by himself, indicating I should go with him.  Here's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: I had set up the blanket and we were expecting our friends. I felt like it was an escalation to take a stand and go sit alone with Fred rather than for Amy and Fred to continue to keep distance and resolve at a later time. While it was super clear that Amy started the original rent issue by refusing to communicate, neither handled it well and I was upset with both of them.  I went off to call a friend and vent. Fred came up to me and insisted I go sit with him or he was going to leave and take the car with him, leaving Amy and I to find our own way home. He said he wouldn't tolerate being treated like this (a common feeling he has about Amy) and needed me to take a stand with him. I felt like he was putting me between a rock and a hard place. I told him explicitly, repeatedly, that I agreed with him, side with him, know it's wrong, and just don't agree with his actions handling it after the fact. I think he felt betrayed and like I wasn't taking his side.  I was able to convince him to leave me the car because I felt that was kind of rude, and he went home on his own. Now he isn't speaking to me and is extremely upset-- more than usual, and I'm wondering if I read the whole situation wrong.

He's always been great about using meat substitutes to cook, and doesn't keep much meat in the house (it's his house if that matters). He tells everyone he doesn't eat much meat because he doesn't think it's fair to eat what I can't, but I always tell him that it's my choice to not eat meat, and he can eat what he wants. He buys things like cold cuts, chicken legs, etc on occasion.\n\n Tonight I woke up from a nap, to him searing a steak.

I never told him he couldn't eat the steak, or even how disgusted I was, I simply set up the fan and that was enough.

AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Taking My Partner's Side Over My Roommate's Behavior?'""}]","I live with my girlfriend and our mutual friend, who I'll call Alex. We've been living together for about a year now, and for the most part, we get along well. However, recently there’s been some tension between Alex and my girlfriend, and things took a turn during a recent argument.

The situation began when my girlfriend decided to host a small gathering at our place for her birthday. She planned it out and made sure to communicate to both Alex and me what she wanted—just a few friends over, snacks, and some games. Alex, however, had a different idea. He insisted that it would be a great opportunity for him to invite some of his friends over as well. He didn't run this by my girlfriend, and when she found out, she felt very overwhelmed. 

I tried to talk to Alex and explain that this was my girlfriend’s special day, and he shouldn't invite people without consulting her first. He brushed me off and said it was “just friends hanging out” and that I was overreacting, which frustrated me. I stood my ground, and ultimately, I told Alex that if he didn't respect my girlfriend's wishes, I would have to ask him to leave for the night.

When the day of the party arrived, Alex seemed visibly upset, sulking in his room while my girlfriend and her friends enjoyed themselves. He later confronted me about taking her side over him, claiming that I was being unfair and that he felt excluded from our friend group. I reassured him that it wasn't about excluding him but rather about respecting my girlfriend’s birthday and what she wanted for her celebration.

Afterward, it felt like I had a target on my back. Alex has since been cold towards my girlfriend and me, and it makes living together awkward. Some mutual friends think I should have been more accommodating to Alex and that I shouldn't have put my girlfriend's needs above his. Others support my decision, stating that it was her birthday, and I had every right to stand by my partner.

Now I’m left feeling conflicted. Did I overstep by taking my girlfriend’s side rather than trying to find a compromise? AITA for siding with her on this?","My roommate, Alex, and I have been living together for about a year, and things have generally been good. We're both in our mid-twenties and work similar hours, so we have a comfortable routine. A couple of months ago, I started dating Sarah, and things got serious pretty quickly. She's at our apartment quite often, to the extent that she's almost a third roommate now.

Here’s where the problem started. Alex has some quirks. He is very particular about his things and personal space. He's always been clear about boundaries, which I’ve respected. However, Sarah has a tendency to move things around, borrow stuff without asking, and just generally make herself at home. I've talked to her about it, but she says she forgets and doesn't think it's a big deal.

A couple of weeks ago, Alex came home to find Sarah had rearranged the living room to make more space for a get-together we were having. He was visibly upset but didn’t say anything in front of Sarah. After she left, he confronted me, saying he felt disrespected in his own home. I felt caught in the middle because, on one hand, Sarah didn't mean any harm; she just wanted to make the space more comfortable for us and our friends. On the other hand, I understood Alex’s frustration. 

I tried to smooth things over by telling Alex it wasn’t a big deal and we’d put everything back the way it was. This did not go over well. He said I was dismissing his feelings and taking Sarah’s side because I didn’t want to upset her. He’s been distant and cold ever since, and I know it’s because he feels like I’m not respecting him or his space.

Some mutual friends have said that Alex is overreacting and needs to lighten up because he can be a bit uptight. Others have said that it's not fair to him to have someone constantly in his space, doing things he’s not comfortable with. Sarah doesn't think she did anything wrong and says she refuses to tiptoe around in an apartment that's also mine.

Currently, the tension is through the roof. Alex avoids common areas when Sarah is around, and it’s making living together really uncomfortable. I don’t want to ruin my friendship with Alex, but I also don’t want Sarah to feel unwelcome.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for taking my partner's side over my roommate’s behavior?","I (25F) have been living with my partner (26M), Alex, and our roommate, Jamie (28M), for about a year now. We all get along great, or so I thought. The other day, Jamie had a huge blowout with Alex in the living room, screaming at him for not doing enough chores. Alex was understandably upset and told Jamie that he couldn't just yell at him like that in the living room. Jamie stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.

The next day, Alex came to me and told me what had happened, but also mentioned that Jamie had been acting really passive-aggressive towards him for weeks, not just about chores, but also about personal stuff. He told me that he felt disrespected and unheard. I listened to Alex and we had a long conversation about the situation.

Meanwhile, Jamie came to me separately and told me that he was stressed out because Alex wasn't pulling his weight in terms of household responsibilities. He said that Alex was being really insensitive and dismissive of his feelings. He asked me to talk to Alex and tell him to step up his game.

I felt bad for Jamie and his stress, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel that he was being really unreasonable and overreacting. I told Alex that I believed him and that I thought Jamie was being really unfair. I even suggested that we have a roommate agreement to clarify our expectations and responsibilities.

Alex was relieved and thanked me for taking his side. Jamie, on the other hand, was furious and told me that I was taking Alex's side because I'm in a relationship with him. He said that I'm biased and that I don't care about him or his feelings.

Now, the three of us are barely speaking to each other, and the tension in the apartment is palpable. I feel guilty for taking Alex's side, but at the same time, I think Jamie was being really unreasonable.

21,AITA for being upset that someone is naming their kid after my recently deceased father?,"AITA?   My dad died this past May after an extremely long battle with lung disease, a lung transplant, and the complications of the transplant (he died almost 2 years after receiving the transplant). There was a lot of suffering, both mentally and physically, experienced by my dad of course but also my mom/sisters/myself. I won’t go into detail, but the last two years have been extremely challenging for us all.  My dad had a sister, and they are estranged. I could not recognize her passing in the street, and they have probably spoken less than 5-10 times in the 30 years I’ve been alive. His sister has two kids, a son and daughter, both older than I am. The only time the son has ’shown’ up in our lives is when he called our house to ask my dad for money. Writing this post, I can’t even remember what his name is. The daughter friended me on Facebook years ago and did occasionally ask me how my dad was when he was at his sickest (mostly to share with her mom). My dad’s sister, her daughter, and her daughter’s kids showed up to my older sister’s wedding in 2013 - they sat in the car during the outdoor ceremony (the weather was beautiful) and left immediately after. That was the first/last time we saw them, and the first/last time my parents saw the little kids. They did not come to my wedding. (We invited them out of respect and not wanting to exclude any of my dad’s few relatives).  Tonight, the daughter messaged me on Facebook to tell me that her daughter is having another baby boy, and that the baby’s middle name will be my dad’s first name. I’m devastated. We would not recognize these people passing in the street. My dad would recognize his sister, but not his niece/her kids. They have had nothing to do with us and vice versa. Aside from the wedding, the only contact they’ve made is when asking for money or gifts. They didn’t send a card when he died, much less call. My older sister thinks this is a roundabout way to get us to send money/gifts to them, but I wouldn’t give them that much credit IMO.  I replied to her message with “That is an interesting choice to make, seeing as how my dad does not know you or your children and vice versa.” She has not seen/responded.  I realize I can’t force them to change the name, but IMO it’s ridiculous/bizarre to name a whole ass child after someone you do not know and who meant nothing to you, and disrespectful/clueless to message me and tell me as if I should be happy about this. I also feel robbed of the ability to honor my OWN DAD by naming a future child after him (married, no kids yet). what do you all think?",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Post: AITA?

To give you some background, we had a pretty rough childhood and my relationship with our father was complicated. After years of tension and fighting, I ultimately cut ties with him and have been trying to move on. I’ve spent a lot of time healing from our family's past.

Recently, Sarah had a baby, and I heard through the family grapevine that she named her daughter after our dad. I was shocked—not only because we haven't spoken much in recent years, but also because naming her baby after someone who caused us both a lot of pain felt like a huge betrayal. It felt like all the progress I’ve made in healing was being overshadowed by this decision.

When I got the news, I admit I reacted pretty poorly. I expressed my feelings to some family members, saying it was insensitive and hurtful. They all seemed to be on Sarah’s side, saying she had every right to name her child whatever she wanted and that I was being selfish for thinking otherwise. Even our mom chimed in, saying that I should be happy for Sarah and that my feelings about our dad shouldn’t overshadow her joy of becoming a parent.

I know I probably could have handled my emotions differently, but it felt so personal to me. I confronted Sarah directly, letting her know how upset I was about the name choice. She was hurt and told me I was being dramatic. She said that she felt like naming her daughter after our dad might help bridge some of the family gaps and create a new legacy. 

Now, I’m grappling with whether I overreacted or if I had a right to be upset considering our shared history. My friends are split on this—some say I should just let it go and focus on the positive, while others agree with me that it was inconsiderate to name her child after someone who had hurt us both. 

So, AITA for being upset that Sarah named her baby after our dad without asking me first?","I (29F) have been estranged from my sister, Jessica (33F), for about six years. Our relationship fell apart after a huge family fallout involving our dad. When our parents divorced, Jessica sided with our mom, and I sided with our dad. Things got messy, and we hadn't spoken since.

A few months ago, I heard from a cousin that Jessica had a baby boy and named him Michael, after our dad, who passed away two years ago. This really stung. Our dad and I were super close, and I felt like honoring him in this way should have involved me in some way.

I reached out to Jessica to express my feelings, but it didn't go well. I told her that naming her baby after our dad felt like a betrayal since she hadn't been in contact with him or me for years. I felt like it was my right to have a say in how our dad's memory should be carried on in the family.

Jessica was taken aback and told me that she named her son after our dad not to upset me but to honor him in her own way. She said that despite the estrangement, he was still her father too and she had the right to name her child whatever she wanted. She also pointed out that she didn't need my permission.

Our mom and other family members are divided. Some think that Jessica should have considered my feelings and at least given me a heads-up. Others think I'm overreacting and that Jessica didn't do anything wrong. My husband thinks I'm being too sensitive and that it’s Jessica's right as a mother to name her child as she sees fit.

Since then, Jessica and I had another heated exchange and haven’t spoken. I know our relationship is strained, but I just can't shake the feeling of being hurt and left out. 

Am I the asshole for being upset that my estranged sister named her baby after our dad without asking?","My sister and I haven't spoken in about 5 years, ever since a falling out over our family dynamics. Our dad passed away a year ago, and I was shocked when my sister announced that she was pregnant and had chosen to name her baby after him.

The thing that really got my goat is that she never even mentioned it to me. She didn't reach out to ask if I'd be okay with it, or if I had any feelings about the name. She just went ahead and did it without a second thought. I found out about the name when she posted about it on social media.

To be honest, I'm still hurt and angry about it. My sister and I have a complicated history, and I feel like she's just using our dad's name as a way to get a reaction out of me or to prove some kind of point. I feel like she's disrespecting our dad's memory and our family's feelings.

I've been avoiding social media and avoiding contact with my sister and her family, just because I don't want to deal with the drama and hurt feelings. My friends and family are all saying that I'm being petty and that I should just ""get over it,"" but honestly, I'm still feeling really upset about it.

I know that I'm not close to my sister right now, but that doesn't mean that I don't still care about her and our family's history. I feel like she's made a big mistake by not considering my feelings, and I'm not sure how to deal with it.

My husband thinks I'm being too sensitive and that it’s Jessica's right as a mother to name her child as she sees fit.\n\nSince then, Jessica and I had another heated exchange and haven’t spoken. I know our relationship is strained, but I just can't shake the feeling of being hurt and left out. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset that my estranged sister named her baby after our dad without asking?""}]","{

22,AITA for not wanting to pay for the repair of my friend's Macbook?,"AITA for not wanting to pay for the repair of my friend's Macbook? It was a friday night, I had arranged to meet up with a group of friends. We were going to drink and have fun playing some games after a stressful week of college tests. I organized everything to receive them and prepared myself to be a good hostess, I was taught hospitality and to always make sure that the guests were comfortable. Anyway, everyone arrived, we started to eat and talk, until one of the friends gave us the idea to move the furniture from the living room to play with VR, we were going to take turns and watch all of us playing a horror game in VR and laugh at the situation. I started removing the furniture from the living room, there weren't that many, so I asked them to just wait, the help really wasn't needed. Until it was time to carry an old armchair, it was heavier than other furniture, so my sister who lives with me helped me carry it, but I hadn't noticed that there underneath a backpack and a jacket on the armchair there was a Mac. Unfortunately, the accident happened, at a certain moment we tilted the chair too much and everything fell down and the Mac broke. (It doesn't change the situation, but both of us were sober) I was shocked by the situation, so was the owner of the notebook (she is one of my closest friends in the group). The atmosphere became tense, because she was very upset. At the end of the night, after everyone had left, by messages, we were deciding on the prices and how we were going to solve the problem. The next day, I was told about private conversations of other colleagues talking about this situation in which I was called a jerk for not offering to pay for the repair entirely. Until then it was just an unpleasant situation that could be solved quickly, but some people in the group decided to get involved and give their opinions. The only thing I could think of to defend myself in this situation is that the Macbook was in the wrong place, where anyone could sit, totally unprotected without a protective cover or inside the backpack. But I accept the view that I might be wrong, as I could have checked the situation better and taken the objects off the armchair before moving it. Maybe I should be more aware of people and their objects in my home, or maybe people should take care of their personal objects in environments that are not their home, I really don't know, I don't have an opinion. We are still sorting out the financial part, for now we have decided to split expenses in half, but some friends of hers have convinced her that I should take over all the expenses, making the conversation uncomfortable and a bit awkward. This situation is being a bit stressful and creating intrigue with a friend that I wouldn't want to lose. I don't know if I am wrong or right, some friends are divided, some have even said that I shouldn't pay for anything. This is creating intrigue and discussion in our social circle.

I thought it was weird he wouldn’t mention his wife so I messaged her and said we needed to talk.\n\nWe met later at a cafe and I told her that no one knew who she was because Theo never mentioned her. I talked about how women would flirt with him. I mentioned he never wore a wedding ring. She started blinking hard as if trying not to cry. She looked crushed. But she was a sweetheart and paid for my coffee before I even got a chance to.\n\nThe past few days Theo has been very moody. He started buying lunch instead of bringing one from home. He’s been ignoring me which interferes in our work. He cornered me today after work and told me that his wife was sad and he didn’t know why but it was my fault. He told me to never contact his wife or talk about her again. I told my coworkers what happened and everyone expressed shock that he had a wife. A few coworkers said I was an asshole for telling my coworker’s wife that he hid her existence but most took my side. My boyfriend said I was in the right and people would want to know if their spouse was acting shady like Theo.\n\nEdit: is it not normal to chat with people evenif its strangers? I grew up in a small town and we talked with everybody. Wasn’t unusual to see your teacher at a bowling alley or your mechanic at the bar.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Blaming My Friend for Damaging Her Own MacBook at My Party?'""}]","Last weekend, I (27F) hosted a small gathering at my apartment to celebrate my promotion. I invited a few close friends, including my longtime friend Sarah (26F). We've been friends since college, and while we have a great time together, there’s always been a slight competitive edge between us. 

The night was going well. We were playing games, laughing, and enjoying drinks. I made sure to set clear boundaries about the space—no food or drinks near the electronics, and we were all respectful of that. Sarah, however, kept insisting on staying near the snacks while using her MacBook. I reminded her a couple of times to be careful since things were getting a bit rowdy, but she brushed it off and said she was fine.

As the night progressed, things got a little out of hand. We were playing a party game that involved tossing a ball around, and somehow, during a particularly enthusiastic throw, the ball hit Sarah’s laptop, knocking it off the table. I felt terrible, but the screen shattered on impact. It was a horrible sound, and everyone went quiet.

After the shock wore off, Sarah started to freak out. She was upset, and I completely understood why, but honestly, I felt a bit frustrated too. I told her in the moment that it was somewhat her fault for not being more careful with her laptop while in a chaotic environment. I should have been more supportive, but I couldn't help but point out that she had the opportunity to move her laptop away from the snack area where the ball was flying.

Since then, things have been rocky between us. Sarah has been distant, and when I reached out to check in, she told me I should have been more responsible as a host and that my blame was unfair. A few other friends have also said I shouldn’t have said anything, insisting that accidents happen and that I should have just helped her instead.

Now I’m left wondering if I did cross a line. I definitely didn’t mean to ruin the night or the friendship, but I felt her lack of caution was a contributing factor. Am I the asshole for blaming my friend for damaging her own MacBook at my party?","Last weekend, I (24F) hosted a small party at my apartment. It wasn’t anything crazy, just some close friends, drinks, and music. My friend Emma (23F) brought her MacBook along because she needed to finish some work before the deadline. She asked if it was okay if she sat at the dining table and wrapped it up during the party, and I said sure, no problem.

As the night went on, the party got a bit livelier. People started dancing and moving around more, and there were drinks everywhere. At one point, a couple of friends were horsing around near the dining table. One of them accidentally bumped into the table, causing a drink to spill all over Emma's MacBook. Emma freaked out, and understandably so. She tried to dry it off, but it wouldn’t turn back on. She was really upset and said she needed it for an important project.

Here’s where things got tense. I told Emma that she should have known better than to bring something so valuable to a party where drinks would be spilled. I pointed out that it was kind of her fault for leaving it out in the open. Emma was furious and accused me of being insensitive and not taking responsibility for my party. I tried to explain that it was just bad luck and that it could have been avoided if she hadn't brought the MacBook, but she wasn’t having it.

Now, Emma isn’t talking to me, and a few of our mutual friends are siding with her, saying that I should have been more apologetic and considerate. Some others agree with me, saying it was a party and accidents happen, and Emma should have been more cautious with her laptop.

I feel bad that her MacBook got ruined, but I still think it wasn’t entirely my fault. It’s not like I spilled the drink myself. However, the fallout from this incident is making me question whether I handled the situation correctly.

Am I the asshole for blaming my friend for damaging her own MacBook at my party?","I've known my friend Sarah for years, and we've always been close. I decided to host a small party at my place last weekend to celebrate the end of the quarter. I invited a few close friends, including Sarah. The party was pretty low-key, just some drinks, snacks, and music.

The incident occurred when I left the room for a bit to grab some more snacks from the kitchen. I asked Sarah to keep an eye on her drink, which was sitting on the coffee table. When I came back, I noticed that the coffee table was a mess, with glasses, bottles, and coasters scattered everywhere. And to my horror, Sarah's MacBook was lying on the floor, with a giant dent in the screen and a cracked keyboard.

At first, I was worried that someone had broken it, but then I saw Sarah frantically trying to pick up her laptop and pieces of broken glass. She was clearly distraught, and I felt bad for her. But when I asked her what happened, she started blaming me for not watching the party closely enough and for not having a designated ""tech station"" where people could keep their valuables safe.

I was taken aback by her reaction, and I told her that it seemed like a pretty careless mistake on her part. I mean, she had her drink on the coffee table, and she must have knocked it over when she got up to get something. I told her that I wasn't going to pay for her laptop, and that it was her responsibility to take care of her belongings.

Sarah got really upset and started yelling at me, saying that I was being insensitive and that I should have been more careful. She claimed that I was being a bad host and that I should have anticipated that something like this would happen. She even went so far as to say that I was ""trying to get rid of"" her by blaming her for the accident.

The rest of the party was pretty awkward after that, and I ended up having to kick Sarah out when she started getting too loud and obnoxious. Now, she's not speaking to me, and I'm feeling pretty guilty about the whole thing.

Lila is health-conscious, and she's always been vocal about her feelings on smoking. I get it; she doesn’t like it, but I’ve been smoking for a long time and it’s something I enjoy. I’ve tried to cut back after she voiced her concerns, and I can definitely see the appeal of leading a healthier lifestyle, but I also feel like I shouldn't have to completely give it up just because she doesn't like it.

Recently, we were hanging out on a lazy Sunday afternoon when Lila casually brought up my smoking habit again. She made a comment about how she thinks it’s ""gross"" and that I really should consider quitting for my health and for our future together. Honestly, I felt like she was lecturing me, and instead of taking it calmly, I responded with a sarcastic remark. I said something like, ""Sure, let me just throw out my smokes and start running marathons instead, right?"" I thought I was being funny, but she didn't take it that way.

Her face just dropped, and she got really upset, saying I was making light of an issue that really bothers her. I tried to explain I was just joking, but she was too hurt to see the humor in it. We ended up in a bit of an argument; I felt like she was overreacting while she thought I was being dismissive of her feelings.

Afterwards, some of our mutual friends weighed in. They suggested that while I may have been trying to be funny, it was inappropriate given the seriousness of the topic for Lila. They felt I should have been more understanding about her concerns, and that my sarcasm was out of line. I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I also think she could have approached the conversation more gently.

Now, I'm left feeling confused. I see both sides, but I feel like I was just trying to lighten the mood. I didn't think my response warranted the level of anger she showed. So, AITA for being sarcastic when my girlfriend brought up my smoking habit?","I've been dating ""Emily"" for about a year now, and things have been going great for the most part. However, there's one issue that keeps coming up: my smoking habit. I've been smoking for about ten years, and while I know it's not the healthiest choice, it's something that helps me relax and unwind.

Emily has always been clear about her dislike for smoking, but she knew I smoked when we started dating. She's been gently encouraging me to quit, giving me articles about the health risks, and even suggesting alternatives like nicotine patches or vaping. I appreciated her concern but didn't commit to anything because, in all honesty, I wasn't ready to quit.

The other night, we were having dinner at my place, and out of nowhere, Emily started talking about how her uncle had recently quit smoking after years of trying. She went on about how much healthier and happier he seemed, and how proud his family was of him. At this point, I was feeling a bit defensive, so I sarcastically said, ""Well, good for him. Maybe I should just quit right now and become everyone's hero.""

Emily looked hurt and stopped talking about it. The rest of the dinner was awkward, and she left shortly after. I thought it was just a small tiff, but the next day she texted me saying she was really disappointed in my reaction and felt like I didn't take her concerns seriously. She mentioned that health is important to her, and she couldn't understand why I was so dismissive.

I told my buddies about it, expecting them to back me up, but even they were like, ""Dude, she cares about you. Maybe you were a bit of a jerk."" My family, who knows how stubborn I can be about my smoking, also said I should apologize and try to see things from her perspective.

Emily and I haven't talked much since that night, and I can tell she's still upset. I get that she wants the best for me, but I felt ambushed and defensive. 

Am I the asshole for being sarcastic when my girlfriend brought up my smoking habit?","I've been dating my girlfriend for about 6 months now, and overall, our relationship has been great. However, one thing that's been a source of tension between us is my smoking habit. I've been smoking for about 5 years now, and I know it's not the healthiest habit, but it's something I've always enjoyed.

Last night, we were hanging out at home, watching a movie, and my girlfriend brought up my smoking habit again. She's mentioned it before, but this time, she seemed really upset about it. She started lecturing me about how it's a huge turnoff and how it's going to kill me. I get it, I really do. But, to be honest, I was feeling a bit annoyed by her constant nagging about it.

So, when she started going on and on, I let my sarcasm get the best of me. I told her that I was glad she was so concerned about my health, but that I was planning on quitting tomorrow. I know it sounds stupid now, but at the time, I was just trying to shut her down and make a point. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.

But, of course, she took it the wrong way. She started crying and said that I was making fun of her and her concerns. I tried to apologize and explain that I wasn't trying to be mean, but she just shut down and said she needed some space.

Now, she's been giving me the cold shoulder all day, and I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I messed up by being sarcastic, but at the same time, I feel like she's overreacting. I know I shouldn't have made light of her concerns, but I feel like she's been on my case about this for a while now, and I just needed to vent a bit.

I’ve had this friend, Jake, stay with me for a couple of months. He was going through a rough patch—lost his job, broke up with his girlfriend, and needed a place to crash while he got back on his feet. I was more than happy to help him out, and honestly, it felt great to be there for someone in need. I didn’t charge him rent or anything, and I even let him use my food and household supplies freely.

Recently, I had a couple of friends over for dinner, and we had a nice spread. Jake tagged along and seemed to enjoy himself. As the night went on and we all ate, I casually mentioned that since he was living with me rent-free, I thought it would be nice if he could treat me to dinner next time we went out—just to balance things a bit. I thought it was a reasonable request since I have been helping him out, and I figured it would show he appreciated my hospitality.

Well, things quickly went south. Jake got visibly upset and mentioned that he felt like I was keeping score and that asking him to treat me was inappropriate given his financial situation. I was taken aback; I thought I was just making a friendly suggestion. I didn’t mean it as a demand, and I genuinely didn’t expect him to take me out to a fancy dinner right away, but maybe a casual meal once he was stabilized.

After our conversation, I reached out to a few friends for their opinions. To my surprise, most of them said that I was in the wrong for expecting something in return, even if I didn’t explicitly ask for it. They argued that hospitality should come without strings attached, and I shouldn't be keeping track of favors. 

Now, Jake feels awkward around me, and I sense a rift forming. I keep flaring up with regret for bringing it up and feeling like I've put him in a tough spot. I’ve realized that my intentions may not have come across as I wanted them to. I was just hoping it would lead to some reciprocity down the line without making it a transactional friendship.

So, based on all this, I’m starting to think I might have misjudged the situation. Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to treat me to dinner after letting him stay with me for free?","So, my friend Alex has been staying at my place for the last couple of weeks. He's going through a rough patch, lost his job, and needed a place to crash while he gets back on his feet. I've known Alex for years, and he's always been a good friend, so I didn't think twice about letting him stay with me rent-free.

The past few weeks have been okay for the most part, but I've been covering all the household expenses, from groceries to utilities. I didn't mind it much at first, but it started to get a bit frustrating. I felt like he wasn't even trying to contribute in any way. He would sleep in late, play video games, and didn't help around the house.

A few nights ago, I suggested we go out for dinner. I picked a reasonably priced place, not too fancy, but not a fast-food joint either. When the bill came, I kind of expected Alex to at least offer to pay since he's been living here for free. But he didn't. He just sat there, waiting for me to pick up the tab. Feeling annoyed and a bit hurt, I didn't say anything, but I paid for the meal.

The next day, I calmly brought it up to Alex. I told him that I felt a bit taken advantage of, and that it would have been nice if he had offered to treat me to dinner as a thank-you for letting him stay with me. He got really defensive and said that he didn't have any money, and that's why he's crashing at my place in the first place. He accused me of being insensitive to his situation and said I wasn't being a good friend.

Our mutual friends are split on this. Some of them think I was being reasonable and that it's not too much to ask for a little appreciation. Others think I was being a jerk for expecting anything from someone who's clearly struggling.

Alex has since found another place to stay, and we're not on great terms right now. I'm starting to feel like I might have been too harsh and not understanding enough of his situation. Maybe I should have approached it differently. 

So, am I the asshole for expecting Alex to treat me to dinner after he’s been staying with me for free?","My friend Emily (25F) and I have been close since we met in college. We've been through thick and thin together, and I consider her to be more like a sister than just a friend. Recently, Emily lost her job due to company restructuring and was in a tough spot financially. I offered her a place to stay in my apartment while she looked for a new job, which she gratefully accepted.

It's been about three months now, and Emily has been living with me rent-free. I've also been covering all of her expenses, from groceries to household bills. Emily has been actively looking for a new job, but hasn't found one yet. In the meantime, I've been supporting her financially, and we've been spending quality time together.

Last night, Emily came to me and asked if I could take her out for dinner. She said she was feeling down about not having a job and wanted to treat herself to a nice meal. I was taken aback by the request, especially since I've been covering all of her expenses for the past three months. I told her that I'd be happy to cook dinner for us at home, but that I didn't think it was fair for her to expect me to take her out for dinner given our current living situation.

Emily got defensive and said that I was being unfair and that she was going to start looking for a place to move out as soon as possible. I explained to her that I wasn't trying to be unfair, but that I was simply expecting some level of reciprocity given the significant financial support I've been providing her. Emily stormed off, saying that I was being a bad friend.

Now, I'm feeling guilty about how I handled the situation, but at the same time, I feel like I was reasonable in expecting Emily to contribute in some way.

Earlier this year, my friend Sam invited me over to check out some art items they had imported from abroad. Sam is really passionate about art, and these pieces were their pride and joy. They had talked about them for weeks before my visit, and I could tell how much they meant to Sam.

When I arrived, I was a little distracted and not paying full attention to my surroundings. I was in the middle of a conversation with Sam about their collection when I accidentally bumped into a display table. Before I knew it, I had knocked over one of the imported sculptures. It shattered into pieces, and I was horrified. I immediately apologized and felt terrible about what happened.

Sam was understandably upset. We both knew that the sculpture was irreplaceable and had cost a significant amount of money. I tried to comfort Sam and reassured them that I would make it right. I told them I would be willing to cover the cost of the sculpture, but when Sam told me the total loss was around $3,000, I started to feel uneasy. 

I suggested to Sam that I could pay half, which I felt was fair considering my carelessness, but they insisted that since the item was mine to begin with and I had knocked it over, I should pay for the full cost. This was a big blow to my budget, and I felt it was excessive considering it was an accident.

Our mutual friends are split on this. Some think I should pay the full amount since it was my fault, while others believe that accidents happen and that I shouldn’t be held fully responsible for a mistake. As Sam and I continued to discuss this, things got heated, and our friendship became strained.

Now, I feel guilty about the situation, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to bear such a huge financial burden for a mistake that wasn’t intentional. Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to cover part of the loss instead of the full amount?","This is a bit of a long story, but I need some unbiased opinions. My friend, Alex, and I have known each other since college, and we both have a love for unique, imported goods. Alex recently took a trip overseas and brought back a few delicate, handmade items that he was really excited about. He asked if he could leave them at my place for a couple of days since he was moving and didn’t want them damaged in the process. Naturally, I agreed—what are friends for, right?

The items were packed in a sturdy-looking box, and he even warned me to be careful with them. I had to clean up my place a bit and decided to move the box to a safer spot. As I was doing so, I got distracted by my phone. I set the box down carelessly on the edge of the coffee table, and as fate would have it, it tumbled off onto the floor. I heard a distinct shattering sound and immediately felt my heart sink. 

When I opened the box, I found that one of the items was completely broken beyond repair. The rest had minor damages. I felt awful but didn’t think it was the end of the world. I called Alex to tell him what happened, expecting him to be upset but understanding. To my surprise, he was livid. He told me that the broken item was a rare piece that he paid a lot for, and the others were almost just as valuable. 

He asked me to pay for the full cost of the damaged goods, which amounted to a few thousand dollars. I was taken aback. I admitted that I was careless but didn’t think I should have to foot the entire bill. I offered to pay half, thinking that was reasonable given that it was an accident. Alex, however, insisted that since it was my carelessness, I should pay the full amount.

We went back and forth about it, and now our friendship is on shaky ground. My other friends are divided. Some say I should suck it up and pay because it was my fault, while others say Alex should have known the risks of leaving such valuable items with someone else. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

What complicates things further is that Alex isn’t exactly rolling in money right now, and this loss hits him hard. I get that, but a few thousand dollars is a lot for me too. I don't want to lose a friend over this, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m being extorted for money.

So, AITA for expecting Alex to share the financial burden of the broken imported items?","I've been friends with Alex for years, we've been through ups and downs together. Lately, I've been going through a tough time and my house has been a bit of a mess. Alex has been super understanding and has helped me out countless times. They're really good at sourcing unique stuff from abroad and have a great eye for finding unique items.

One day, I was in a rush to leave the house and didn't notice that Alex had left some of their imported items on the floor. I knocked over a shelf and ended up shattering a beautiful vase and a few other valuable items that Alex had received from their family in Japan. The total value of the items is around $800.

Alex was understandably upset when they saw the mess and the broken items. They asked me to help pay for the replacements or at least cover some of the cost. I told them that I'd do my best, but I couldn't afford to pay the full amount right now. Alex said that they understood, but they expected me to contribute at least half of the cost since I was the one who broke the items.

I've been putting it off, and now Alex is giving me the cold shoulder. They say they can't believe I'm not taking responsibility for my actions and that I'm just expecting them to foot the bill. I told them that I'd pay what I can, but I just can't afford to pay the full amount right now.

My friend, Alex, and I have known each other since college, and we both have a love for unique, imported goods. Alex recently took a trip overseas and brought back a few delicate, handmade items that he was really excited about. He asked if he could leave them at my place for a couple of days since he was moving and didn’t want them damaged in the process. Naturally, I agreed—what are friends for, right?\n\nThe items were packed in a sturdy-looking box, and he even warned me to be careful with them. I had to clean up my place a bit and decided to move the box to a safer spot. As I was doing so, I got distracted by my phone. I set the box down carelessly on the edge of the coffee table, and as fate would have it, it tumbled off onto the floor. I heard a distinct shattering sound and immediately felt my heart sink. \n\nWhen I opened the box, I found that one of the items was completely broken beyond repair. The rest had minor damages. I felt awful but didn’t think it was the end of the world. I called Alex to tell him what happened, expecting him to be upset but understanding. To my surprise, he was livid. He told me that the broken item was a rare piece that he paid a lot for, and the others were almost just as valuable. \n\nHe asked me to pay for the full cost of the damaged goods, which amounted to a few thousand dollars. I was taken aback. I admitted that I was careless but didn’t think I should have to foot the entire bill. I offered to pay half, thinking that was reasonable given that it was an accident. Alex, however, insisted that since it was my carelessness, I should pay the full amount.\n\nWe went back and forth about it, and now our friendship is on shaky ground. My other friends are divided. Some say I should suck it up and pay because it was my fault, while others say Alex should have known the risks of leaving such valuable items with someone else. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nWhat complicates things further is that Alex isn’t exactly rolling in money right now, and this loss hits him hard. I get that, but a few thousand dollars is a lot for me too. I don't want to lose a friend over this, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m being extorted for money.\n\nSo, AITA for expecting Alex to share the financial burden of the broken imported items?""}]","{

26,AITA for paying my cousins back for a gift for me?,"So recently, I (19M) went to Malaysia to visit my extended family there. We were close growing up and have still been close until now but I haven't been able to see them for over 3 years because of the travel ban.  Anyways, while I was there, I bought one of my cousins (he was the youngest of five and since the economy there is quite bad, he had mainly only gotten hand-me-downs) a pair of Air Jordans for RM 800 (approx USD$169) and a few days later, when I was about to fly back home, his older siblings wanted to buy me gifts on my way back.  I insisted no and said there is no need for them to buy me anything as I had a great time there and I cannot accept gifts from them considering the horrible conversion rate they were receiving, anything for me would be too expensive for them (USD$1 = 4.73 RM). But they had actually bought a bunch of clothes and accessories for me while we were out in secret and somehow snuck them all in my luggage and I only found out about them when I got home.  There wasn't a receipt either but when I tallied everything up based on estimation, I estimated that they had given me RM 1000 worth of gift. I know they're financially stable. But when I thought about it, while those gifts are about USD$200 for me, they're easily spending RM 1000 and I just felt bad accepting it so I PayPal'ed their eldest sibling for the gifts and thanked them but said I couldn't accept it since it was a lot coming from them.  He ended up texting me back saying I was an AH for rejecting their good intentions and for ""indirectly calling them poor"" when that wasn't my intention at all. I told my mom about it and she agreed I was in the wrong for sending the money back as it came across that I was a snobby AH who looked down on their social status. Anyways I apologized to him and asked my grandmother to explain to them that it wasn't my intention to come across as snobby and explained my reasoning behind it and we're cool now but I'm just really puzzled if I was an AH for returning their money.

But when I thought about it, while those gifts are about USD$200 for me, they\'re easily spending RM 1000 and I just felt bad accepting it so I PayPal\'ed their eldest sibling for the gifts and thanked them but said I couldn\'t accept it since it was a lot coming from them.  He ended up texting me back saying I was an AH for rejecting their good intentions and for ""indirectly calling them poor"" when that wasn\'t my intention at all. I told my mom about it and she agreed I was in the wrong for sending the money back as it came across that I was a snobby AH who looked down on their social status. Anyways I apologized to him and asked my grandmother to explain to them that it wasn\'t my intention to come across as snobby and explained my reasoning behind it and we\'re cool now but I\'m just really puzzled if I was an AH for returning their money.

I was completely blown away by their thoughtfulness and how much they had spent on me. In the past, we’ve always exchanged gifts, but this was on another level.

The problem started when I realized how expensive their gift was. I felt guilty receiving something so elaborate, especially since it seemed like they had stretched their budget. I'm not one to expect big presents and I would have been just as happy with a small token or spending quality time together. My cousins, however, have always been quite successful and have the means to splurge a little more on gifts. 

After mulling it over for a few days, I decided that it would be best to return the gift. I didn't think it was fair for them to spend that much money on me, and I didn't want to feel indebted to them. I reached out to them and explained my feelings, offering to return the gaming console and games so they could recoup their money. I figured it was a sensible move, especially since I didn’t want to make them feel obligated to spend so much on me in the future.

To my surprise, they were not pleased at all. My cousins expressed their frustration and disappointment, saying that they gave me the gift because they genuinely wanted to celebrate me, not because they expected anything in return. They insisted that it was meant to bring joy and that I was taking away that joy by returning it. They also stressed that they enjoyed giving extravagant gifts and that it wasn't a burden for them at all.

I honestly thought I was doing the right thing by refusing such an expensive present, but now it seems I may have offended them. They’ve started avoiding my calls and haven’t been as engaged in our group chats. My family members have also chimed in, saying I overreacted and that I should have graciously accepted the gift instead of trying to return it.

So, now I’m left wondering if I was wrong to send the gift back. AITA for returning the expensive gift money to my cousins?","I recently celebrated my 30th birthday and had a small get-together with close family and friends. It was a lovely evening, and I appreciated everyone who took the time to come. My cousins, who are very well-off financially, surprised me with a very expensive gift—a high-end designer watch. I was taken aback by their generosity and felt uncomfortable with the extravagant gift, considering that my financial situation is nowhere near theirs.

To give you some background, my cousins and I have always had a good relationship, but we come from very different economic backgrounds. They are used to lavish spending and grand gestures, while I am much more frugal in my lifestyle. I always make a point to give thoughtful but modest gifts, and it has never been an issue until now.

After some thought, I decided to return the watch to them along with a heartfelt note explaining my discomfort with accepting such an expensive gift. I also included a check for an amount that I felt was more reasonable, closer to what I could afford to spend on them.

When my cousins received the returned gift and the check, they were visibly hurt and offended. They called me and said they had chosen the watch specifically for me, knowing it would suit my tastes and lifestyle. They said the gesture was meant to show their appreciation and love, and that returning it felt like I was rejecting their feelings. They insisted they could afford it and that it was not a big deal for them at all.

My parents and siblings also weighed in. My mom thought it was a considerate move on my part to return the gift because she knows I hate feeling indebted to anyone. My dad, on the other hand, said I should have just accepted it graciously. My siblings were split; one understood my discomfort, while the other thought I was making too much of it.

The fallout has been awkward. My cousins have started to distance themselves from me a bit, and I can sense the tension whenever we interact. The last thing I wanted was to cause a rift in our relationship over a material gift, but here we are.

So, am I the asshole for returning the gift money to my cousins after they gave me an expensive gift?","I'm 25 and my cousins are 28 and 30. We've always been close, especially during the holidays when we'd spend a lot of time together. Last Christmas, they gave me a really expensive watch worth around $500. I was touched by their generosity and told them thank you, but it was a bit more than I was expecting.

I wanted to return the favor, so I decided to give them a gift card for $500 to help them pay off some of their debt. I thought this way, I could return the money they spent on me and also help them out financially. I told my cousins that I wanted to give them the gift card to help them pay off some bills and that it was a gesture of goodwill.

However, they were really upset when I gave them the gift card and told me that I should have just said thank you and left it at that. They said it was embarrassing to receive a gift card for that much money and that it made them feel like they were in debt to me. They also said that I was taking away the value of the watch by returning the money, and that it was like saying their gift wasn't good enough.

Now they're not speaking to me and I'm feeling really guilty about the whole situation. I thought I was being kind and generous by giving them the gift card, but I guess I didn't think it through. I'm wondering if I was the asshole for returning the money.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I recently celebrated my 30th birthday and had a small get-together with close family and friends.

27,AITA for humiliating MIL at a family dinner when she wouldn't stop going on about grandchildren?,"Please don't post this elsewhere (aka tiktok, YouTube).  I (27f) haven't gotten along with my MIL for the better part of my relationship with my partner (27m). She has said a lot of mean things about me that are honestly just childish and cruel (I won't get into the he said she said stuff). I've become exhausted with her, especially as I've moved into my career, moved town and am in the process of getting married/ buying a house. In the past few years shes taken to outright ignoring me, speaking over me, pretending i dont exist. As a result, I've mentally checked out from trying to make things working with her and in part so has my partner. Let me make it clear, I support whatever relationship he wants to have with her, but I'm done trying to be her friend.   We were at a family dinner party (my partner asked me to come along) recently where she started asking him about when he's having children. She kept pestering him and asking when she's getting grand babies and that she wants children around. This has been something shes been harping on a lot about lately and its getting on my nerves. My partner asked her to stop several times but she kept bringing it up. I was sat there silent for a bit, but I think the wine got the best of me so I kinda snapped. I turned to her and started asking what she wants to know about our *private* life?? What kind of protection we're using, what positions we've tried, what toys we use. I started to list them all. Lets just say I used very inappropriate language for a dinner table, even throwing in a ""do you have any pointers for me, or maybe it'd be best if you just came and watched to make sure we're doing it right"". At this point she was yelling at me, having a go at my partner for ""letting"" me speak to her like that and crying about how mean I am. We got up shortly after and left.    My partner thinks I took it a bit far in front of his family, and his aunties have said it was wildly uncalled for and mean. I don't really feel bad for it though, should I?  AITA?  ETA: I'm infertile. She isn't aware of this, I'd never give her that info to weaponise against me. But just for the people commenting to keep kids away from her, I won't have any to keep away from her but thank you for the advice. I know your hearts in the right place.  My partner has told her several times we won't be having children and to drop it. Since my partner always wanted children, she's assumed that I simply don't want children and am taking that away from him.  UPDATE:  Thank you all for the replies! I appreciate the people giving some reasoning behind YTA and ESH. I normally go to my friends about these things but I worry it's maybe a bit of an echo chamber, they're so supportive and might not call me out on my BS. I can say I've read most, if not all the replies, and I still don't feel that bad about what I said (sorry YTA and ESH people!).   MIL has since messaged my partner, I won't put the exact wording. But she has said that she ""knows"" I'm the cause of her not having grandchildren and she's disappointed in him for being with me. She also said how grandchildren are a basic right, and even if they are half carrot_sloth89's children, she would still find it in her heart to love them and shape them into good people.   My partner blocked her after that. I know a few people suggested I just tell her I'm infertile, but the way she weaponises information is honestly terrifying. Some other people said that my partner should say he is infertile, and I think that's a valid option, but for now he wants no contact.   Some people have suggested adoption. Thank you, I know it's coming from a good place, I just want to wait a while before considering children. I don't want to bring in a child that will likely have considerable trauma themselves into a house where I haven't fully healed. It's not fair on them. I'd also never want them to think they're filling a void just because we couldn't have children naturally, that's a heavy burden to place on a tiny person. I also think I'd like to do some pre-adoption therapy (if that's a thing lol) for a year or maybe even some classes to better educate myself on how best to adopt and raise an adopted child. I'm not about continuing any cycles of abuse here. Also, if we do adopt MIL won't meet them. I'd hate for her to say anything nasty or hurtful because they aren't ""blood related"".

So if I want to have a friend stay with me for a few days, my roommate has to agree and vice versa. We both have had friends over before and it's always gone over peacefully. We both also have had more than one friend over with no issues because we respected eachother's space and belongings.

He told me to stop being childish because he has a right to refuse guests for being uncomfortable whereas I was doing it to be annoying. What's even more irritating is that he has met Mike before and they get along with eachother. He then said he'd invite them over anyway but I said I'd call the landlord if he did so.

At first, I tried to be accommodating, but her invasive questions and snide comments have increasingly made me uncomfortable. Although I’ve brought up my feelings to my husband, he always says she means well but can be a bit much.

Recently, we had a family gathering where my in-laws were present. While we were all eating, my mother-in-law started probing into our plans for having kids. I’ve been open about wanting to take my time, but she doesn’t respect that and continually presses the issue. She also goes so far as to ask personal questions about my reproductive health, which feels really inappropriate. 

That day, after the fourth or fifth question, I finally snapped. I told her that I find her inquiries invasive and that it was none of her business. I regretted my tone almost immediately, as the table fell silent. My husband looked shocked, and his parents exchanged glances. For a moment, I felt a rush of relief for standing up for myself, but it quickly turned into discomfort when I realized I might have crossed a line. 

Afterward, my husband gently told me that while he understands where I was coming from, the way I addressed it could have been more tactful. He said it upset his mom, who has always been sensitive and that I shouldn’t have escalated things like that. On the other hand, his sister supported me and said someone needed to call out their mother for her behavior.

In the days following, my mother-in-law has barely reached out to me. I feel bad for potentially hurting her feelings but also believe that my boundaries deserve respect. It’s a complicated situation, and I’m torn about how to handle things moving forward. 

So, AITA for calling out my mother-in-law’s invasive behavior and standing up against what I see as emotional abuse, despite the way I did it?","I (32F) have been married to my husband (34M) for five years. His mother (MIL, 58F) has always been a bit overbearing and intrusive, but recently it's gotten worse. My husband is an only child, so she tends to be extremely involved in our lives, often crossing boundaries that should be respected.

A few months ago, we started trying for a baby. We didn't tell anyone because we didn't want the added pressure, but somehow my MIL found out. Since then, she has been incessantly asking invasive questions about our sex life, fertility treatments, and even suggesting ""remedies"" and ""rituals"" that she believes would help us conceive. I’ve repeatedly asked her to stop, but she just won't listen. This constant intrusion is really taking a toll on me.

Last week, we had a family dinner, and she brought up the topic again in front of everyone, asking if we had ""finally done it successfully."" I lost my cool and finally called her out, telling her that her questions were invasive and disrespectful, and that her constant badgering about our private life was bordering on emotional abuse. She got very upset, started crying, and left the room.

My husband supports me in private but says I could have handled the situation more tactfully. He believes his mother means well and that I should have had a private conversation with her instead of calling her out in front of everyone. My own parents think I should have set boundaries earlier and stood firm, but they agree that my outburst was over the top

Since the incident, my MIL has been sending passive-aggressive texts and has even involved other family members, painting herself as the victim of my ""unprovoked"" attack. The family is now divided, with some taking her side and others thinking I did the right thing by standing up for myself.

My relationship with my husband has also taken a hit. While he understands my frustration, he thinks I should apologize for the public confrontation. I, on the other hand, think MIL needed to be called out for her invasive behavior and that maybe this was the only way to make her understand. 

So, AITA for calling out my mother-in-law's invasive questions and standing up to her emotional abuse?","I've been married to my husband for five years, and we've been together since college. My mother-in-law (MIL) has always been a bit invasive, asking prying questions about our personal lives, finances, and relationships. However, I've learned to brush it off and give her the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe she's just curious or doesn't understand boundaries.

Recently, we were over at their house for a family dinner. MIL started asking me about my weight and body shape, making snide comments about how I should be doing more to take care of myself. My husband jumped in to defend me, saying something about how she shouldn't be commenting on my body, but I could tell he wasn't fully standing up to her.

When I spoke up and told her that her comments were hurtful and invasive, she became defensive, saying I was being too sensitive and that she was just trying to help. She then went on to ask my husband if I was ""still taking care of myself"" when I was pregnant with our first child, implying that I had gained too much weight. I felt a surge of anger and hurt, knowing that she was trying to shame me in front of our child.

My husband tried to intervene again, but this time I stood up for myself and told his mother that her comments were not okay and that she needed to respect my boundaries. I explained that her questions and comments were not only hurtful but also made me feel like I wasn't good enough.

MIL became tearful and started playing the victim, saying that I was being mean and ungrateful, and that she was just trying to help. My husband got caught in the middle, trying to mediate the situation and calm everyone down. But I knew I had to stand up for myself and set clear boundaries.

The situation escalated, with MIL becoming more aggressive and emotional. My husband tried to intervene again, but this time I told him that he needed to support me and stand up to his mother. He eventually did, but not before MIL had said some hurtful things to both of us.

In the end, we left the dinner early, feeling frustrated and upset. My husband apologized to me for not standing up to his mother sooner, and I appreciated his support. However, I'm still trying to process the emotional abuse I experienced at the hands of my mother-in-law.

ESH for standing up to my mother-in-law's invasive questions and emotional abuse, or was I justified in calling her out?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I (32F) have been married to my husband (34M) for five years. His mother (MIL, 58F) has always been a bit overbearing and intrusive, but recently it\'s gotten worse. My husband is an only child, so she tends to be extremely involved in our lives, often crossing boundaries that should be respected.\n\nA few months ago, we started trying for a baby. We didn\'t tell anyone because we didn\'t want the added pressure, but somehow my MIL found out. Since then, she has been incessantly asking invasive questions about our sex life, fertility treatments, and even suggesting ""remedies"" and ""rituals"" that she believes would help us conceive. I’ve repeatedly asked her to stop, but she just won\'t listen. This constant intrusion is really taking a toll on me.\n\nLast week, we had a family dinner, and she brought up the topic again in front of everyone, asking if we had ""finally done it successfully."" I lost my cool and finally called her out, telling her that her questions were invasive and disrespectful, and that her constant badgering about our private life was bordering on emotional abuse. She got very upset, started crying, and left the room.\n\nMy husband supports me in private but says I could have handled the situation more tactfully. He believes his mother means well and that I should have had a private conversation with her instead of calling her out in front of everyone. My own parents think I should have set boundaries earlier and stood firm, but they agree that my outburst was over the top\n\nSince the incident, my MIL has been sending passive-aggressive texts and has even involved other family members, painting herself as the victim of my ""unprovoked"" attack. The family is now divided, with some taking her side and others thinking I did the right thing by standing up for myself.\n\nMy relationship with my husband has also taken a hit. While he understands my frustration, he thinks I should apologize for the public confrontation. I, on the other hand, think MIL needed to be called out for her invasive behavior and that maybe this was the only way to make her understand. \n\nSo, AITA for calling out my mother-in-law\'s invasive questions and standing up to her emotional abuse?'}]","{

28,AITA for wanting to bring a nerf gun during trick or treating?,"So I'm a 21 F and I absolutely love Halloween, I try to spend as much time as I can when it comes to my costumes, mostly the props since sewing is too advanced for me, and this year I decided to be a triangle guard from squid game because ever since it came out last year I had wanted to be a character from it because I love the show.  Now, I'm too old to go trick or treating by myself without it seeming questionable but I have some step siblings, the oldest of them is married with a kid in middle school and they're not from the country so they never really got to go trick or treating and I wanted to give the kid a fun experience. Now back to the matter at hand, as the triangle guard, they're known to be the ones with the weapons and they eliminate the rule breakers or the players who fail their task, that's literally their job, so I wanted to be more into the role of the character and I got a nerf gun, the model is the Fortnite BASR-L Bolt Action that I spray painted black and have added some pink, logos, symbols, even a quote from the show on it. However, my stepdad says that if I bring it with trick or treating, I'll be putting his grandkid in danger because it looks too much like a real gun. Well, its supposed to look like a gun first of all, second, I've customized it and I doubt anyone will see a squid game soldier with a black and pink gun with paper logos taped onto it threatening. My mom takes his side like always and she tells me I need to leave it.  Here's the thing, I'm currently jobless without any income because I was in the hospital 3 different times from emotional distress, I wont go into detail because this post is long enough, and this gun with the supplies costed over $40 and I have very little money but I wanted this Halloween to be just as fun as my other ones with my costumes but this $40 is a lot of money to me with no income, since it was already painted, I can't return it and it's basically $40 completely wasted.  I've asked my step sister and she says it's fine and her husband is actually encouraging me to bring it, I've told a friend and she says that I'm in the right to be upset and that I'm old enough and I don't need to be told what to do by my parents. But I want to see what other people will think, maybe I'm in the wrong and if I am, I need help understanding why. So, am I the asshole if I bring a nerf gun trick or treating?  Also the area we live in is mostly LDS families and college students, so It's not like there's sketchy activity or anything like that.  Edit: Just from the few comments from the last few minutes alone have helped me see why its a bad idea, I'm going to leave the gun at home and I'm going to apologize to my mom and step-dad for thinking their concerns were invalid.

Now, I'm too old to go trick or treating by myself without it seeming questionable but I have some step siblings, the oldest of them is married with a kid in middle school and they're not from the country so they never really got to go trick or treating and I wanted to give the kid a fun experience. Now back to the matter at hand, as the triangle guard, they're known to be the ones with the weapons and they eliminate the rule breakers or the players who fail their task, that's literally their job, so I wanted to be more into the role of the character and I got a nerf gun, the model is the Fortnite BASR-L Bolt Action that I spray painted black and have added some pink, logos, symbols, even a quote from the show on it. However, my stepdad says that if I bring it with trick or treating, I'll be putting his grandkid in danger because it looks too much like a real gun. Well, its supposed to look like a gun first of all, second, I've customized it and I doubt anyone will see a squid game soldier with a black and pink gun with paper logos taped onto it threatening. My mom takes his side like always and she tells me I need to leave it.  Here's the thing, I'm currently jobless without any income because I was in the hospital 3 different times from emotional distress, I wont go into detail because this post is long enough, and this gun with the supplies costed over $40 and I have very little money but I wanted this Halloween to be just as fun as my other ones with my costumes but this $40 is a lot of money to me with no income, since it was already painted, I can't return it and it's basically $40 completely wasted.  I've asked my step sister and she says it's fine and her husband is actually encouraging me to bring it, I've told a friend and she says that I'm in the right to be upset and that I'm old enough and I don't need to be told what to do by my parents. But I want to see what other people will think, maybe I'm in the wrong and if I am, I need help understanding why. So, am I the asshole if I bring a nerf gun trick or treating?  Also the area we live in is mostly LDS families and college students, so It's not like there's sketchy activity or anything like that.

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I’m the asshole I get it.

For Halloween this year, I decided to take my love for them to the next level by customizing a nerf gun to make it look super cool. I spent hours painting it, adding some creative details, and honestly, I was really proud of my work. It was all in good fun, and I thought it would be an awesome accessory for my costume.

I showed my idea to my parents, expecting them to be just as excited as I was. Instead, they totally freaked out. They said that bringing something that looked so realistic, even though it’s just a nerf gun, could make people uncomfortable or even scared, especially with everything going on in the world. They were really concerned that it could be perceived as a real weapon and that I’d get in trouble or face backlash.

I tried to explain that it’s just a nerf gun and that everyone would understand it was for Halloween, but they wouldn’t budge. They were adamant about not letting me take it to school. I felt like they were being overly cautious and not allowing me to express myself. Halloween is supposed to be fun and creative, right? 

In a moment of frustration, I decided to go to school with the nerf gun anyway. I thought that once my friends saw it, they’d all appreciate the effort I put into customizing it and that teachers would understand it was just meant for Halloween fun. When I got to school, my friends loved it, but some teachers were not impressed. They ended up taking the nerf gun and I got called into the principal's office. 

Now, I’ve gotten in trouble for defying my parents and bringing the gun to school. My friends think it was awesome and say my parents are being overprotective, but I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I did cross a line. I reached out to my parents later, and they were furious, saying I put myself in danger of facing serious consequences. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to bring my custom nerf gun to school for Halloween, despite my parents’ concerns? I thought I was just trying to have fun, but now I’m questioning if I mishandled the whole situation.","Alright, I know this might sound a bit crazy, but I need some perspective. My high school is having a Halloween costume contest, and I wanted to go all out this year. I've been working on this really badass custom Nerf gun for my costume. It’s painted and modified to look super cool and realistic—think sci-fi blaster vibes. I admit, it looks pretty authentic, which is why my parents are freaking out.

They think bringing it to school is a terrible idea. My dad even said it could get me suspended or worse, and my mom is worried that someone might see it and think it's a real weapon. But it’s a Nerf gun! I mean, it's orange and blue underneath the paint, and it's supposed to be fun, right? I don’t see the harm in it, especially since it’s not like I would be using it for anything other than the costume contest.

My school is usually pretty relaxed about Halloween costumes. Last year, one kid came dressed up as a soldier with a toy rifle, and no one seemed to care. I tried to use this as an example, but my parents wouldn't budge. They even suggested I leave the blaster at home and just go with the rest of the costume, but the whole thing is based around this prop. It won't make any sense without it.

I argued that if I explain to the teachers and principal beforehand, they would understand it's just a part of the costume. But my parents are concerned about setting a bad precedent or causing unnecessary panic, especially in today's climate. They worry that even if I get permission, it might still upset some people or spark a negative reaction.

So now I'm stuck. The costume I’ve been working on for weeks feels incomplete without the Nerf gun, and I really don’t want to bail on my idea. I think they're overreacting and being paranoid. Plus, Halloween is supposed to be fun and creative! 

My friends are split on this. Some think my parents are being reasonable given the nature of the prop, while others agree with me that it's not a big deal and I should go for it.

Am I the asshole for wanting to bring my custom Nerf gun to school, despite my parents' concerns?","I'm still trying to come to terms with how things went down, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether I was the asshole in this situation.

I (14M) have been obsessed with a particular Nerf gun for months, and I finally convinced my parents to let me order a custom version for Halloween. I had my heart set on a unique design that I thought would make it stand out from the usual store-bought Nerf guns. However, when I presented the idea to my parents, they were immediately hesitant.

""Dude, are you sure you want to bring a Nerf gun to school?"" my mom asked. ""What if people think it's real? What if someone gets scared or calls the cops?""

I brushed it off, thinking that it was a silly concern. ""Mom, it's a Nerf gun! It's clearly not real. Everyone will know it's just for Halloween.""

But my parents were adamant that it was a bad idea. They told me that even if I explained it was a toy, some people might still get spooked or misinterpret it. They suggested I just stick with a costume and leave the Nerf gun at home.

But I was determined to bring it to school. I even made a poster explaining the difference between a Nerf gun and a real one, thinking that would put people's minds at ease. I showed it to my parents, but they just shook their heads.

On Halloween, I wore my costume and carried the custom Nerf gun to school. As expected, some people were confused at first, but I quickly explained that it was just a toy. However, one kid started freaking out, shouting ""Oh my god, it's a real gun!"" and ran away. Another kid called the office, saying that I was threatening people with a real gun.

The school had to call the police to come and check it out, which was super embarrassing for me. My parents were called in to explain the situation, and I was given a warning for bringing a ""potentially threatening object"" to school.

Now I'm wondering, AITA for not listening to my parents and bringing the custom Nerf gun to school, despite their concerns?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Alright, I know this might sound a bit crazy, but I need some perspective.

29,AITA for declining a new kitten after my cat died?,"Backstory: I (19F) live with both my dad (46M) and my stepmom (43F), we also had 2 cats one is 2y and the other was 10y. The oldest one has been there for me for ages and always cuddled up to me if i was sad. I was and still am very attached to him.  Now a few days ago we sadly had to say goodbye to the oldest and all 3 of us were devistated, the death happened at the vet after he got a blood clot in his heart. Now 5 days have passed and it was my first day working again, since the death took a toll on me. I am still very upset and mentioning him still makes me cry as im still grieving.  My dad took it a bit better and while SM seemed just as sad as i was the day it happened it almost feels like it isn't affecting her anymore. I know different people grieve in other ways but it just rubbed me the wrong way. On my way home today she texted me a picture of another kitten who was around 16 weeks and needed a new home. I told her the kitten was cute but asked if it wasnt too fast for a new cat. She replied that our other cat looked lonely and upset and that he needs a new buddy. I just replied with an ""okay"" and waited for the conversation to continue at home.  When i got home not 10 minutes later she told me we could go and meet the new kitten tomorrow, i just didn't know what to respond. To me it all felt way too quick for a new kitten in the house. When I didn't respond she asked me if I dont want to go look and i answered honestly; i think its too fast for a new kitten and not a good idea. She replied that she would cancel the appointment and just walked away. I started to feel bad and asked if she was mad at me and SM only said she was dissapointed.

They decided to give the child up for adoption. A girl. Later on, we meet, get married, and I have three kids that are now 15, 14, and 9. In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship. My children were also very young when my husband died with my youngest two having pretty much no memories of him and my oldest very few and we have spent many years moving on with our lives (yes I know that sounds horrible). My SIL is not going to give our contact information to the girl without my consent of course, but I do feel bad. My SIL also told me that she had found her biological mother but that she didn’t want anything to do with her so I feel doubly bad. AITA for not bringing my husbands biological daughter into our lives?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: NAH, Title: 'AITA for Being Disgusted by Stepmom's New Kitten Just 5 Days After Our Cat Passed Away?'""}]","My family has always been super close to our pets. Growing up, we had a cat named Whiskers who was with us for 16 years. He was more than just a pet; he was part of our family. We all took care of him, and when he passed away just five days ago, it hit us hard. My kids were devastated, and I was personally heartbroken. We spent the week reminiscing about all the good times we had with him and trying to comfort each other.

A few days after his passing, my stepmom came over and shocked us all by bringing home a new kitten. She was clearly excited about it, but I couldn’t help but feel disgusted and hurt. To me, it felt like she was trying to replace Whiskers, and it seemed incredibly insensitive given how fresh our grief was. I voiced my feelings, telling her that it felt too soon to be welcoming a new pet into the house when we were still mourning the loss of our beloved cat.

My stepmom argued that she thought it would help to have a new pet around to bring some joy back into the house. She loves animals and thought that having a playful kitten would lift our spirits. I get her intentions, but all I could think about was how our family was still hurting and needed time to heal. Conversations quickly turned into a debate, and other family members ended up weighing in. Some sided with my stepmom, saying we should welcome the new kitten as part of moving on, while others understood my perspective of wanting to honor Whiskers.

As of now, there’s a bit of tension in the family. My stepmom feels frustrated and thinks I’m being unreasonable, while I just feel upset about the timing. It’s not that I dislike the kitten; I just think it’s too soon.

So, am I the asshole for being disgusted by my stepmom's decision to get a new kitten just days after our cat passed away?","Last week, my family's beloved cat, Whiskers, passed away after being with us for 12 wonderful years. It was a sudden loss and very hard on all of us, especially me since Whiskers had been my constant companion since childhood. My dad remarried about two years ago, and I've been living with him and my stepmom since then. We’ve had a decent relationship, though we’re not super close.

Just five days after Whiskers passed away, my stepmom came home with a new kitten. She seemed really excited and named it Muffin. But I was completely taken aback and frankly a bit disgusted. It felt like Whiskers had just been replaced, and it hurt a lot to see a new cat (who looks somewhat similar to Whiskers) running around the house so soon after he died. I tried to avoid the kitten, but my stepmom kept trying to get me to interact with Muffin, saying things like, ""Muffin will help you feel better"" and ""Isn't she adorable?""

I know she meant well, but it just made me more upset. My dad tried to mediate and explained that my stepmom hates being in a house without a pet, and getting Muffin was her way of coping with the loss. He also pointed out that Muffin wouldn't replace Whiskers but rather be a new member of the family. I understand where they're coming from, but I still can't help feeling angry and hurt. It feels too soon for me, and seeing Muffin just reminds me of how much I miss Whiskers.

My friends have mixed opinions on this. Some think I'm being unreasonable and that the new kitten could actually help me heal, while others think it's incredibly insensitive to bring in a new pet so quickly. As of now, things are pretty tense at home. My stepmom seems to feel bad for upsetting me, but she also defends her decision, expressing how lonely and sad she felt without a pet around.

Am I the asshole for being disgusted by my stepmom's new kitten just five days after our cat passed away?","I've been married to my husband for about 5 years, and we've had a cat named Luna for the entire time. She was a beloved member of our family, and we recently lost her due to illness. It was a tough loss for both of us, but we were trying to stay positive and focus on the happy memories we had with Luna.

My husband and I had been talking about getting a new pet, but we agreed that we needed some time to grieve and adjust to life without Luna. Just 5 days after she passed away, my husband surprised me by announcing that he had brought home a new kitten from the shelter. He was excited to introduce me to the new addition, but I was taken aback.

I tried to keep my emotions in check and be supportive, but as soon as I saw the kitten, I felt a wave of disgust wash over me. I couldn't believe that my husband would bring home a new pet so soon after we lost Luna. I felt like he was disrespecting our cat's memory and not giving us enough time to grieve.

I know my husband was coming from a good place, wanting to fill the void left by Luna's passing, but I couldn't help but feel hurt and angry. I told him that I wasn't ready for a new pet and that I needed more time to process our loss. He was understanding, but I could tell he was disappointed.

Now, I'm feeling guilty for being so upset, but at the same time, I don't want to be around the new kitten. I know it's not fair to the kitten, but I just can't bear the thought of having a new pet so soon after losing Luna.

30,AITA for getting myself water from behind the bar?,"I was at a pub for an evening with friends. It's a two level establishment, with a quiet section upstairs that we're at. I know there was one empty table on the upper level the whole night, but I don't know how busy downstairs was. I've been here before and they've sometimes had a ""help yourself"" water jug and glasses on the bar in the past, though this wasn't the case tonight.  I don't drink, but I ordered an appetizer and water. My appetizer comes in decent time, but then the waiter disappears.  Over an hour later, no water has arrived for me (though two friends who ordered a drink and water had their water arrive). My group hasn't ordered another round in a while and I realize there's no server in sight.  I'm really thirsty by now, so I get up and and look for water. There's a bar upstairs, but the server is nowhere in sight. The whole floor has been left unattended; presumably our server is downstairs.  I assume they're busy and look for a water glass and jug. No dice. But there is the bar tap (no barrier or sign in the way). I go behind the bar and fill up a glass with water. Sit back down, drink it. A few minutes later I've drained my glass and want more water. Still no server in sight, so I go behind the bar again and fill my glass with water.  Just then the server reappears up the stairs, and they are livid when they see me behind the bar. I get a dressing down that it's illegal for a customer to step behind the bar (with the fact that it serves alcohol I probably should have had some inkling, but it didn't occur to me, the non drinker, at the time).  I explain that my water never arrived, and I didn't see her anywhere so I thought to fill my glass up myself. The server says they did in fact serve my water, and points to a friend's water. The friend says it's theirs as the server storms off, making a point of shutting the (previously unseen and unused) half-door thingy into the bar. They avoid my table for the rest of the evening, and when I settle the bill I apologize. I get another dressing down, making the table quite awkward. I know at this point that I did an absolute no-no. I say goodbye to my friends, leave a $10 tip on my $10 appetizer and walk out, not saying anything more to the server.  Am I the asshole here? Did they over-react, or am I lucky I wasn't barred from the establishment? I'd also love to know if the act of a customer stepping behind the bar itself is actually illegal or if it's more of a health code/insurance/don't look like you're trying to steal a drink thing.",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Post: I was at a pub for an evening with friends.

So if I want to have a friend stay with me for a few days, my roommate has to agree and vice versa. We both have had friends over before and it's always gone over peacefully. We both also have had more than one friend over with no issues because we respected eachother's space and belongings.

I love hanging out with this group because we all share a similar vibe, and the energy is always fun. We were having a great time, eating good food, and catching up after a long week.

So, after our meal, I felt really thirsty. I asked our server if they could bring me a glass of water. They told me that the bar had a strict policy about serving water and that I would need to order a drink first. At first, I thought they were joking, but the server was serious. I wasn’t about to pay for a soda or beer just to quench my thirst, especially since I’m trying to be more health-conscious and avoid sugary drinks. 

After a few minutes of waiting and feeling increasingly parched, I decided to take matters into my own hands. The pub had a self-serve area with water jugs as well as cups, so I quietly walked over to fill a glass for myself. I figured since the water was out in the open, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But as I was filling my glass, the same server spotted me and came over, looking furious. They told me I wasn't allowed to do that and that I needed to sit down and wait for my drink. 

I told them I was just trying to get some water because I was thirsty. The server escalated it by saying I was being disrespectful and could be kicked out for ignoring their rules. I felt humiliated and just returned to my table, but I couldn't shake the frustration I felt about the whole situation. I ended up sharing what happened with my friends, and some thought I was justified in getting my own water, while others believed I should have just ordered something instead.

As the night went on, I could tell the vibe had shifted. Some people were whispering about the incident, and I felt like I was the topic of conversation. I can see now that maybe I could have handled it differently, but I was just so frustrated by the whole server's attitude. My friends mostly backed me up, but a couple of them pointed out that I probably escalated it by pushing back on the server instead of just accepting their policy.

In hindsight, I understand the server was just doing their job, but it felt like such a ridiculous situation to me. There's a part of me that thinks I might have overreacted, but I don’t think I was wrong to want some water. So, AITA for filling my own glass at the pub when they wouldn’t serve me water?","Last weekend, I went out with some friends to a local pub. We were having a great time, enjoying food and drinks, when I realized I was getting pretty thirsty and wanted some water. I went up to the bar to ask for a glass of water, but the bartender told me they were too busy and I'd have to wait. I waited for about fifteen minutes, and when I tried again, I got the same response.

Frustrated, I saw a self-service water station on the other side of the bar, but it was roped off and looked like it was for employees only. Desperate, I decided to quickly go over and fill my glass there. I thought it'd be a simple and harmless act, but as soon as I started pouring, one of the bartenders saw me and came over, looking furious. They told me I wasn't allowed back there and that I needed to wait my turn like everyone else. In my annoyance, I snapped back that I had already waited and they weren't doing their job by not serving me water. 

This obviously didn't go over well. The manager got involved, and I was told to leave if I couldn't respect their rules. My friends got upset too, saying that I overreacted and should've just waited a bit longer. They were annoyed that my actions caused a scene and potentially embarrassed them. We ended up leaving the pub shortly after this incident.

On one hand, I felt justified in my actions because denying someone water seemed unreasonable, especially when they weren't even busy in the moment I filled my glass. On the other hand, I can see how my actions could be seen as disrespectful and could understand the staff's frustration.

So here I am, wondering if I was the asshole for filling my own glass instead of waiting for the pub staff to serve me. Am I?","I (32M) recently went to my favorite pub with my wife (31F) and a couple of friends to catch up and have a few beers. The pub is usually pretty good about serving water, but today the bartender seemed particularly grumpy.

I ordered a beer and asked the bartender if I could get a glass of water to go with it. He looked at me like I was asking for the moon and grumbled, ""No, we're not doing water today."" I was taken aback - it's a hot summer day and I was parched. I asked him again, politely, if I could just get a glass of water, but he just shook his head and said, ""No, we're not serving water.""

I was starting to get annoyed, so I asked him if I could at least get a glass from the tap to fill myself. He got defensive and said, ""No, you can't do that. You have to order a drink to get a glass."" I explained to him that I just wanted a glass of water, but he wouldn't budge.

At this point, I was getting thirsty and frustrated, so I got up and went to the bar to get a glass myself. I filled it from the tap and sat back down, where the bartender promptly yelled at me, ""You can't do that! That's against the rules!"" I apologized and explained that he hadn't given me a glass, but he just shook his head and said, ""You're being a pain in the ass.""

My wife and friends were all shocked by the bartender's behavior, and they started laughing and teasing me about being a ""water thief."" I just rolled my eyes and said, ""Come on, guys, he's being ridiculous."" We ended up leaving the pub and going to a different bar down the street.

Looking back, I think I was maybe a bit out of line for getting a glass from the tap, but I was also really thirsty and frustrated with the bartender's behavior. AITA for filling my own glass, or was the bartender being unreasonable?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Last weekend, I went out with some friends to a local pub.

31,AITA for not giving my brother my room?,"My brother had gone to college while I was still in my last grade of high school. I’ve never liked my brother nor had a good relationship with my brother.  My brother was fortunate enough to get the college experience meanwhile I had to do online. I was in my first year when my brother came back home to live with me and our parents. Apparently my brother had been slacking according to his teachers and not focusing on his studies. My brother asked if he could have my room in the house and I told him no and to rent a place. He claimed he had no money, he asked to share and I told him that I want my own room and he can sleep on the couch. He slept on the couch for a few months before finally getting a condo. I don’t know if it was the best thing to do but my brother shouldn’t just expect me to give him my room. My parents intervened and I told them he can sleep on the floor. I now regret doing this I feel like I took it too far. Am I the a-hole? I was just worried he would take advantage of me(as he does that a lot). It was a while ago.

He’s been struggling to find a job in his field and decided to move back home with our parents while he figures it out. I totally understand that times are tough, and many of us have been there, but we had a family chat over dinner last week that got me thinking.

During the dinner, my parents made a point of saying how happy they were to have him back and how they would support him for as long as he needed. However, I noticed my brother seemed very unmotivated. He spends most of his time playing video games and watching TV rather than actively looking for jobs. When I brought this up, my parents brushed it off and said he needed time to relax after the stress of college.

Seeing him in that situation and how comfortable he was just lounging at home made me concerned. I believe it's important for him to experience a bit of independence and responsibility, especially now that he’s an adult. I gently suggested that instead of moving back home, maybe he should consider renting a small place for himself. I thought it might motivate him to find work, meet new people, and learn to manage his own life.

My brother did not take this suggestion well at all. He felt hurt and accused me of not being supportive, saying that it wasn’t helpful to pressure him right now. My parents backed him up, explaining that the job market is rough, and he needs their support, not demands.

I still feel that it would be beneficial for him to have that independence, but on the other hand, I understand that he’s going through a tough time. I don’t want to make family tensions worse, but I also want what’s best for my brother. 

So, am I the asshole for telling my brother to rent a place instead of moving back home?","My younger brother, Jake, 28M, recently broke up with his long-term girlfriend and has been struggling to find a new place to stay. He reached out to me, 32F, and our parents, and suggested moving back home temporarily until he can find a new apartment. Our parents were open to the idea, but I voiced my concerns and suggested he rent a place instead.

For context, Jake and I both moved out of our parents' house years ago. They downsized to a smaller home once we were gone, so space is pretty tight now. Jake's relationship had been a bit tumultuous, and every time he faced issues, he would lean heavily on our parents for support. While I understand that he needs a support system right now, I'm worried about the impact this will have on our parents, who are both retired and looking forward to some peace and quiet.

When I suggested that Jake consider renting a place temporarily, maybe even with some financial help from me and our parents if needed, he seemed hurt by my suggestion. He felt that I was trying to push him away during a difficult time. My perspective, however, is that moving back home could potentially disrupt our parents' routine and put a strain on them, especially if this temporary situation drags on longer than anticipated.

I spoke with our parents about my concerns, and while they appreciate my considerations, they believe they can handle it and want to be there for Jake. Meanwhile, some of my friends think I'm being practical and looking out for everyone's best interests, while others feel I might be lacking empathy for Jake's situation.

Now, Jake has started looking into rental options, but there's noticeable tension between us. I feel bad for suggesting it, yet I still believe it was the right thing to do for our parents' sake. Our relationship is strained, and I keep wondering if I should have just stayed silent and let things play out.

So, am I the asshole for telling my brother to rent a place instead of moving back home?","I'm 25M and I've been living on my own for about 5 years now. I've always been pretty independent and don't really like living with my family. My brother, who's 22M, just finished college and has been living in a small apartment for about a year. He recently lost his job and is now looking for a new place to live. He reached out to me and asked if he could move back home.

At first, I was okay with the idea. However, the more we talked about it, the more I realized that it wouldn't be a good idea. My brother is pretty messy and doesn't do much to take care of himself. He would probably just end up eating all my food, watching all my TV, and leaving his trash everywhere. I also know that my mom would likely take care of him and do all the household chores for him, which wouldn't be fair to her.

I told my brother that I understood he was going through a tough time, but that I didn't think it would be a good idea for him to move back home. I suggested that he look for a new place to rent instead, which would be more affordable and would also teach him some responsibility. My mom was really upset with me for not letting him move back home, but my dad understood my perspective.

My brother was initially upset with me too, but he eventually agreed that renting a place would be the best idea. He's now looking for a new apartment and seems to be taking it seriously. My mom is still a bit miffed at me, but I know I made the right decision.

I feel like I'm being a good brother by encouraging my brother to be independent and take care of himself, but I'm also feeling a bit guilty for not letting him move back home.

32,AITA for not responding after being treated badly this weekend?,I(21F) have small friend group. One of the girls in the group is under 21 so it hard for us to go to bars/clubs without making her feel left out. On the 29th one of my favorite bars was doing a Halloween event that seemed like fun. So I suggested that on Friday we would go to house parties so everyone could go together then on Saturday we would go to the bars It seemed like a win win.   leading up to Halloweekend I noticed that a party flyer was going around. It was a party hosted by the girl who is under 21. I only found out about the party because I seen the flyer posted on someone instagram story. Nobody told me about it.    On the 27th I asked the group what was the plan for Saturday. I gave them the opportunity to bring up the party but nothing. Later that night I got left alone with the party host girl. She was talking about the party and I said I didn’t know if I’m  are going cause Im going to the bars. She said I should stop by and insisted I go.   28th we were supposed to start at 8 I called them and they were still getting ready. 8 turn to 9 then 9 turn to 10 and I got no updates so I called again. I felt so embarrassed. When 11 hit I decided to go out somewhere else until they were ready. I only stayed for 30 minutes when they finally said they were ready and sent me the address to meet them. we were 3 hours late so it didn’t seem to be still going. My friend was already drunk and the girls in the group were openly judging her. I helped her then I came back to the group and they started talking about the plans for the 29th. They said “so we were thinking we could come for two hours then leave and go to her party”  weren’t including me in the plans. It seems like they already had this plan set and weren’t asking me they were telling me what was going to happen. I felt so excluded so I just left.   29th hit I didn’t hear from anyone. They called my friend but not me to talk about the plans. Still excluding us from the house party plans. They didn't message me once which was weird. My friend from home got uncomfortable being the middle man so she lied to text me. They didn’t text me until two hours before the bar event started Saying that one didn’t get a ticket yet and someone else wanted to go but didn’t know if they were still selling tickets. Excuses.   When it was time to go they said to go without them because they were still getting ready. I told them no rush because but they insisted on riding separately. I asked them later if they were there yet and she told me they weren’t going and that they were at the house party.  The 30th they called me and I didn’t pick up I was still pissed and hangover. I had a good night still but it made me mad had they was still acting like everything was fine.   So AITA if I never speak to them again?,ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Post: I(21F) have small friend group.

But a few weeks ago, I noticed a bunch of messages in our group chat about a party they were planning. I was excited at first, but then it hit me: I had never been consulted about it. They had decided on the date, location, and even the guest list without even asking for my input.

I felt hurt and honestly a bit betrayed. I mean, we’ve always talked things through in the past. It wasn't just that I wasn't invited; it felt like I wasn’t even part of the conversation anymore. When I brought it up to a couple of friends, they brushed it off like it was no big deal, saying it was just a small get-together. One friend even said that it was probably just an oversight since they were planning it last minute.

I tried to brush off my feelings and not take it personally, but the party day came and my friends were posting pictures and videos in our group chat, and I felt isolated. I snapped a bit and expressed how I felt left out which, to be honest, they didn't take too well. They said I was being dramatic and that I needed to lighten up. I felt like I had every right to feel upset, but then I also felt guilty for snapping at them.

Now I'm at a crossroads. Part of me is considering cutting ties with these friends because I don't want to feel like I’m holding on to relationships that don’t value my presence. But another part of me wonders if I'm overreacting and if I should just let things go. A couple of mutual friends think I should give it some time and not make any rash decisions, while others have said that if they really cared, they would have made sure I was included.

I know I might be overthinking it, but it just feels like this is a pattern of being sidelined in our friendships. I don't want to be the one to just walk away, but I also don’t want to keep setting myself up to feel hurt. Am I the asshole for considering cutting off friends who planned a party without me?","I’ve been part of this friend group for over a decade. We’ve shared countless memories, birthdays, holidays, and spontaneous get-togethers. We’re that close-knit bunch you’d expect to see in sitcoms, always hanging out and supporting each other. Or so I thought.

A few weeks ago, I found out through social media that my friends had thrown a massive surprise birthday party for one of the members in the group. Here’s the kicker—they didn’t invite me. I saw the photos, the videos, the stories, and felt a wave of hurt and betrayal wash over me. It wasn’t just any party; it was elaborate, with decorations, a giant cake, and everyone seemed to be having a blast.

Confused and hurt, I reached out to my best friend in the group, Sarah, to ask why I was left out. Her response was that it wasn’t intentional, and that they must have just forgotten to include me in the plans. She apologized, but it felt hollow considering the tight bond I thought we all had.

Not knowing how to handle my emotions, I decided to confront the group during our next meetup. I told them how I felt, that it seemed an intentional slight rather than an innocent forgetfulness. Some of them looked genuinely taken aback and apologized, while a couple of others seemed dismissive, saying I was overreacting and that these things happen.

This incident has been gnawing at me, and I’ve been pondering cutting ties with them. It feels like a betrayal from people I considered family. However, I’m well aware that suddenly ghosting them or making a big scene could be seen as an overreaction and might indeed paint me as the asshole in this scenario.

When I shared what happened with a few other friends and family members, opinions were split. Some understand why I feel hurt and think it’s justified to feel betrayed. Others believe it was an honest mistake and cutting them off would be too extreme.

Fast forward to now, and things are awkward. Our interactions feel forced and stilted, and there’s this invisible wall between us. I miss the easy camaraderie we used to share, but I can’t shake off the hurt. The incident has made me second-guess our entire friendship. Am I the asshole for considering cutting off friends who planned a party without me?","My friends and I have been close since college. We usually do everything together - go out, travel, and hang out at each other's places. Lately, things have changed though. They've all started getting serious with their partners and moving in together, while I'm still single and trying to figure out my life.

About a month ago, they planned a surprise party for one of their boyfriends' birthdays. I found out about it when one of them sent me a group chat with the party details, and I was not invited. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe it was a mistake or they genuinely forgot, but the next day I got a bunch of texts asking me to help with last-minute tasks and confirming that I wasn't attending.

I've been feeling left out and hurt for weeks now. When I brought it up with them, they told me that they thought I was ""too busy"" with work and that they didn't want to ""disturb"" me, but that wasn't the case at all. I've been making time for them just fine up until now.

When I confronted them about not inviting me, they downplayed it and said it was just a ""quick, impromptu thing"" and that I must have ""misread"" the group chat. I know I didn't misread anything, though - the party was planned weeks in advance and they all knew I wouldn't be able to attend.

Now I'm thinking about cutting off contact with them. I don't feel like I'm a priority in their lives anymore and it hurts to think that they'd plan a party without me. They're all still really close, and it's clear they're forming their own little couples' club without me.

33,AITA for refusing to get a 'real' job?,"I, 19F still live with my parents and this has been a long time issue with them. I currently  work on a horse farm as a working student. I get paid $12/hr with free riding lessons and I get paid under the table. I love my job and though it's hard work, it's enjoyable and something that works well for me because I have ADHD. Despite how much I love my job, my parents think it's a waste because the state doesn't recognize me as being employed, therfore my dad says I don't have a real job and I need to get one.  This started after I dropped out of college due to doing poorly in it. I wish I could go back to school as I aim to be a livestock vet, but due to untreated(Only in the past month have I started treatment) ADHD and the pandemic, I'm mentally unable to do it at the moment. My parents have been pressuring me since I started doing bad in college to just try harder and do more classes even when I'm doing my best. My parents are constantly  making off hand comments  in reply to things I say. For example, I may express interest  in a horse related topic and my mom may reply 'Or  you could be spending your type applying to college' and my dad would chip in 'Or apply and get a real job'.. this has been going on for MONTHS.  At the beginning  of September  we got into a big argument  where I tried to explain my side and how I mentally cannot handle going to college right now even though it would be my dream. How I love my job and even if I get paid less, the people are amazing, It's a job I know I can handle, and I gain valuable  experience  through riding other people's horses outside my own. I refused to listen to their advice and because of it, I was told that I was ""Looking for a roommate situation"" and not to be a part or this family, and thus I would be required to pay rent.      Tomorrow  marks month 2 of paying  rent, and up until Yesterday, I thought I was justified with my decision to stay with the job I have until my family was hanging out with family friends. They were asking me about  my future  plans, and my mom brought up that they want me to get a real job. The family friends asked me multiple  questions about why I don't want to get the job my parents  want me to get, and what makes me think my current  job is better. By the end of the conversation, though they didn't outright say it they made it very clear they sided with my parents.   So now I'm wondering if I should just listen to my parents and get a real job, and If I'm being a jerk for not listening to their advice. I understand that they want what's best for me, and if I get a real job I'll get paid more, but I'm very happy with where I am in life even if it isn't what I had originally wanted. I will have a different job eventually, as soon as I go back to college, but right now I don't feel the need to. I make enough money to pay for my phone, car, gas, and now rent plus  have been putting money away into savings.

Read the Title:\nCarefully read the title of the AITA post.\n\n2. Acknowledge the Required Judgement:\nConsider the judgement indicated (NTA - Not the Asshole, NAH - No Assholes Here, ESH - Everyone Sucks Here).

I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship. My children were also very young when my husband died with my youngest two having pretty much no memories of him and my oldest very few and we have spent many years moving on with our lives (yes I know that sounds horrible). My SIL is not going to give our contact information to the girl without my consent of course, but I do feel bad. My SIL also told me that she had found her biological mother but that she didn’t want anything to do with her so I feel doubly bad. AITA for not bringing my husbands biological daughter into our lives?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: NAH, Title: 'AITA for Listening to My Parents and Ditching My Dream Job on a Horse Farm?'""}]","I’ve always had a passion for horses. Growing up, I spent every free moment at the local stables, volunteering, and learning everything I could about horse care and training. For years, I dreamed of working on a horse farm, and when I finally graduated high school, I got the opportunity of a lifetime: a job offer at a renowned horse farm in a nearby state. It felt like my dream was finally coming true.

When I first told my parents, they were supportive but a bit concerned. They knew how competitive and challenging the horse industry can be, and they worried about my long-term future. They encouraged me to consider pursuing a more stable career, something that I could rely on financially, like going to college and studying something more practical. I brushed it off at first, thinking they just didn’t understand my passion.

However, once I started working at the farm, I quickly realized just how intense and demanding the job was. The hours were long, the pay was low, and there was a significant lack of job security. I often came home exhausted, both physically and emotionally. After a few months, I began to feel the weight of all my parents’ concerns, and I started questioning whether this was the right path for me.

After much deliberation, I decided to listen to my parents and took a step back to pursue my education instead. I enrolled in a community college and started taking business classes, thinking that maybe I could manage a stable one day or work in the horse industry from a different angle. It was a tough decision, and I felt really guilty about leaving the farm and my dream behind.

When I shared my decision with friends from the farm, some were understanding while others were disappointed and thought I was giving up. A few of my coworkers felt betrayed because they knew how passionate I was about working with horses. However, my family was proud and relieved, thinking this was a smart move for my future.

Now, I still love horses, and I’m considering ways to get back into that world, possibly through internships or part-time work while I finish school. But I can’t help but feel like I let myself down by not chasing my dream.

So, AITA for listening to my parents and ditching my dream job on a horse farm?","Ever since I was a little kid, I've loved horses. My dream has always been to work on a horse farm. When I was 18, I got the opportunity to work at a horse farm in another state. It was everything I wanted: surrounded by nature, taking care of horses, and learning the ins and outs of farm life.

But my parents were absolutely against it. They wanted me to go to college, get a degree in something ""practical,"" and have a stable career. They were worried the horse farm job wouldn't provide me with financial security or career growth. They even pointed out that the job didn't offer any benefits and the pay was barely above minimum wage. We had countless arguments about it, and they always ended with my parents saying they just wanted what was best for me.

Feeling torn, I consulted some close friends and extended family members. Most of them sided with my parents, highlighting the importance of a stable job and the long-term benefits of a college degree. Some even suggested that I could always pursue my passion for horses as a hobby rather than a career. 

In the end, I decided to follow my parents' advice. I enrolled in college and chose a major in business administration. It's been three years now, and while I'm doing well academically and have secured several internships, I can't shake off the feeling that I've abandoned my true passion. Whenever I see pictures or videos of horses, or hear about someone working on a farm, I feel a pang of regret.

My parents are thrilled with my progress and often tell me how proud they are. I understand they only wanted the best for me, and I can't blame them for that. But there's a part of me that wonders what life would have been like if I had taken that job on the horse farm. Would I have been happier?

Recently, I brought up the topic again with my parents, mentioning my lingering regrets. They were understanding and said they never meant to stifle my dreams, but just wanted to make sure I had a secure future. They even suggested that, after I graduate, I could find a way to incorporate my love for horses into my life, perhaps by volunteering at a local stable or even considering a career shift later on.

So, am I the asshole for listening to my parents and ditching my dream job on a horse farm? Looking back, I realize there were valid concerns on both sides, and I'm still trying to figure out the best path for me.","I've always been passionate about horses and working with them. Growing up, I was that kid who would muck stalls and help out at the local stable for free just to be around them. So, it's no surprise that when I graduated from college, I decided to pursue a career in equine management. I landed a job at a prestigious horse farm that offered me a competitive salary and amazing opportunities to work with some of the best horses and trainers in the industry. I was living my dream, or so I thought.

My parents, however, were not thrilled about my decision. They'd always envisioned me having a more ""stable"" career - pun intended. They worried about the long hours, the physical demands of the job, and the fact that I'd be working outdoors in all kinds of weather. They constantly reminded me of the importance of having a ""real"" job with benefits and a 9-to-5 schedule. They'd even offer to help me pay off my student loans if I just got a ""respectable"" job in an office.

I tried to reassure them that I was happy and that this was the career path I wanted to take, but they just wouldn't let it go. They'd drop hints about how I was wasting my education and that I should be thinking about my future. They even started to question whether I was truly cut out for the physical demands of the job.

It got to the point where the stress of dealing with their constant criticism was starting to take a toll on my mental health. I started to doubt myself and wonder if I was making a mistake. So, after a year of working at the horse farm, I made the difficult decision to leave and take a job at a corporate office. It was a 9-to-5 job with a steady salary and benefits, but it was not what I wanted to do with my life.

My parents were over the moon with the news. They saw it as a victory and proof that I'd finally come to my senses. But I'm left feeling like I've sacrificed my passion and my happiness for their approval.

34,AITA for not telling my wife about our son's broken arm?,"Backstory, I(42 M) have been with my wife Janet (40 F) for 16 yrs.  We have one son Jack (11 M).   Before we started dating, my wife, her mom and sister have dreamed about doing a girls trip together.  They've never pulled the trigger, but they talk about it at least twice a yr.  So for a combined birthday/Christmas gift for everyone I booked and paid for a 7 night cruise for the 3 of them.  Everyone was super excited and I was husband/ inlaw of the year.   Well.... 2 days into the cruise and my son, being a boy, broke his arm.  We rushed him to the doctor and he's holding up great.  Break wasn't severe and his cast isn't covering his entire arm in the permanent hand raise position.   Here is where I might be the AH.  I didn't tell my wife when it happened.  My initial thought was to immediately call her, but then I thought it through.  1.  I didn't have an easy way to call. She's on a cruise with no cell service.  I'm sure there is way to contact her, but I didn't have it ready. 2.  There was nothing she could do.  Was she going to cut it short and get a crazy expensive 1 way flight to come home?  I didn't want to worry her.  3.  Our son was fine!  He was upset he had to wait for the swelling to go down to get a cast, bc he wanted everyone to sign it.  4. She was going to be home when the cast went on.  So I didn't tell my wife till I picked her up.  Now everyone is calling me an AH for keeping that information from her.  She is mad at me and giving me the slient trestment.  Somehow by not telling her I also ruined the trip. I just wanted her to enjoy a trip she's been talking about for almost 2 decades.    Was I wrong?

I (38M) have been married to my wife (36F) for ten years, and we have two kids together, a son (10M) and a daughter (8F). My wife has been planning a dream vacation to Hawaii for over a year, and this trip was supposed to be her chance to unwind and finally escape the stress of work and family responsibilities.

Last weekend, while my wife was out shopping, my son and his friends were playing in the backyard. Things got a bit rowdy, and my son ended up falling off the swing set and breaking his arm. He immediately started crying, and I could see the panic in his eyes, but I tried to keep calm. I quickly took him to the hospital, where they confirmed he had a fracture and put a cast on his arm.

Now, here's where it gets complicated. My wife’s trip was just days away, and I knew from past experience that she'd tend to worry excessively about any problems leading up to big events. I also knew that if I told her about our son's injury right before the vacation, it would ruin her excitement and cause her a lot of stress. I decided to keep it a secret until after the trip. My son and I agreed that we'd just tell her he fell but was fine, and I promised to keep an eye on him while she was away.

The vacation turned out to be incredible. My wife was so happy, and the kids had a blast. I kept up with our son’s care and made sure he was comfortable and entertained. When we returned, my wife noticed the cast and immediately freaked out. She was upset that I didn’t tell her, and although I explained my reasoning, she felt hurt that I would keep something so significant from her.

I don’t want to hide things from her, but I thought I was acting in her best interest. My wife says I should have trusted her to handle it, no matter how stressful it might have been for her. Family and friends have mixed opinions; some say I did the right thing to protect her joy, while others think I should have been upfront about our son’s injury.

So, am I the asshole for keeping my son's broken arm a secret from my wife to save her stress on her dream vacation?","My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been planning her dream vacation for years. She's always wanted to go to Italy and finally, everything lined up perfectly. We saved enough money, had the time off work, and our kids are old enough to stay with my parents for a week. My wife works extremely hard and deals with a lot of stress, so this trip was incredibly important to her.

On the second day she was gone, I was watching our son (8M) and daughter (5F) when my son fell off his bike and broke his arm. It was a clean break and the doctors said it would heal perfectly with a cast. He was incredibly brave about the whole thing and once he had his arm sorted, he didn't seem to be in much pain. My parents and I managed everything without any significant issues.

Here's where it gets tricky. I didn't tell my wife. She was having such an amazing time, sending me pictures of her with various landmarks, tasting different wines, and just genuinely enjoying herself. I couldn't bear to ruin her trip with news that would make her worry, knowing she'd want to rush home and miss out on something she’s always dreamed about. Our son was in good hands with me and my parents, and he was handling it fine.

I planned to tell her once she got back, but she ended up finding out accidentally. One of my neighbors mentioned something about the cast when she called home to check in. My wife was understandably upset and felt betrayed that I kept such an important thing from her. She came home, a bit earlier than planned, worried and upset.

My parents thought I did the right thing by not telling her to avoid unnecessary worry and stress on her vacation. My wife thinks I should have told her right away, no matter what. She feels like I took away her right to know what was happening with our child and feels guilty for not being there.

Now, I’m torn. I genuinely thought I was protecting her joy and peace, but I see her point too. Our son is healing well and everything is back to normal, but there’s this lingering tension between us. So, AITA for keeping my son’s broken arm a secret from my wife to save her stress on her dream vacation?","My wife and I have been married for 10 years, and we've been working towards a dream vacation to Europe for what feels like an eternity. We finally booked our trip for two weeks, and she's been counting down the days. I've been taking care of the kids while she's been busy with work and getting everything ready for our trip.

About a week before we were set to leave, our 8-year-old son came home from school with a broken arm. He fell off the jungle gym during recess. I knew that if my wife found out, she would be a wreck. She's been under a lot of stress lately, and the thought of dealing with a broken arm on top of everything else was going to be too much for her. So, I made the decision to keep it a secret from her.

I took my son to the doctor, got him the cast, and even managed to get him to school without anyone noticing anything was wrong. I've been doing everything I can to keep the secret under wraps, even sneaking him into the house through the back door when my wife is home.

My wife is completely oblivious, and she's been enjoying every moment of her pre-vacation relaxation. I know it's not ideal to keep a secret like this, but I genuinely believe it's the right decision. She's been working so hard for this trip, and I don't want anything to ruin it for her.

My sister came over the other day and was suspicious, but I managed to brush it off and tell her I was just being a little overprotective. I know it's only going to be a matter of time before the secret gets out, but I'm hoping it won't be until we're on our way back from Europe.

35,AITA for not relenting about organization in shared spaces of our new apartment and driving one of my roommates to possibly move out?," So I 21f recently moved into an apartment with two of my friends who we’ll call Lola 21f and Abby 19f. Lola and I have been living together for two years but Abby was a new addition. I’ve known Abby since high school but we weren’t exactly close friends during that time. In the last year we have been hanging out more and more and have gotten closer. So we all decided to get our first apartment near our college campus together.  Something to understand about me is that I have intense OCD tendencies due to trauma that I experienced both from my parents and from another incident a year and a half ago. I am currently trying to work on it with my therapist but it's a struggle. Both my roommates knew of this before we moved in. Lola doesn’t have a problem with me having control of the organization since it keeps everything nice and clean. Abby, despite saying it was alright, has fought me on everything since day one.  She has been unwilling to compromise in many situations and caused a lot of stress and anxiety for Lola and I. It doesn’t help that Abby and my dad are incredibly close and really good friends. He even takes her side on many of the issues and has teamed up with her on occasion to try and prove Lola and I wrong. I have been feeling very trapped in this situation since she’s always over at my parents house and my dad will usually reprimand me for not “allowing” Abby something when all I’ve ever tried to do is compromise for both of our comfort.  I understand that living with someone with OCD can be very challenging but I have tried so many different things to allow us both comfortable living. Recently, we had our biggest disagreement yet and it was when she put her groceries out and above the cabinets despite there being a free bin for her to use so that the groceries don’t show. It really bothers me and causes me anxiety. I bought her the bin to try and help but she says it's too hard to use. I tried to compromise and move my stuff to a higher cabinet so she could take the easier to reach cabinet but she basically said that if she can’t use the space normally then she will move back in with her parents and not pay utilities. This caused me to have a breakdown in the kitchen that Lola had to talk me down from. I’m now losing sleep over the issue because I know that something isn’t right in the home and I’ve had constant overwhelming anxiety ever since. My hands also shake now as a result.  I want her to be comfortable in her home since it is a shared living space but I also believe everyone should be comfortable. She has also brought up issues in the past just to get a rise out of me and has told me as such when I inquired about her not following through with our compromises. I just need to know if I’m in the wrong for pushing her to this point.

I (26F) recently moved into a three-bedroom apartment with two roommates (let’s call them Sarah and Megan). From the start, I wanted to establish some rules to create a comfortable living environment, especially since I’m a bit of a neat freak and also value personal space. I suggested a cleaning schedule and a few house rules regarding noise and visitors, which I thought were pretty reasonable.

Well, things quickly escalated. Sarah and Megan weren't on board with my ideas. They felt that I was being too controlling and insisted on their right to live freely in their own home. For example, I mentioned that I’d appreciate it if they could limit guests to a couple of times a week to keep things quiet during the workweek. They shot back that they should be able to have friends over whenever they want, and I understood their point but thought it was fair to impose some limits for everyone’s benefit.

Then came the cleaning schedule. I created a detailed chart where everyone had specific duties each week. Sarah has a busy work schedule, and Megan is going through a rough breakup, and suddenly they felt overwhelmed by the structure I was imposing. They argued that living together should be more about flexibility, and the vibe of the apartment felt strained when I didn’t feel the chores were being done properly.

I’ve tried to compromise by suggesting that we could rotate some responsibilities and that I wouldn’t mind picking up more if they needed me to, but they still think I'm being too rigid. They’ve started to get distant, and it feels like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around them, which I really don’t like.

Now I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for being too controlling with them and refusing to compromise on how I believe our shared space should be managed. I genuinely thought I was just trying to create a harmonious living environment, but maybe I overstepped. AITA for holding my ground on boundaries and cleanliness?","Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and need some outside perspective. I live in a shared apartment with two roommates, Sarah and Jake. We've been living together for about eight months now. Everything was fine in the beginning, but recently, I've been feeling like I'm the only one who cares about keeping the place in order. 

I'm pretty particular about cleanliness and organization. I have a cleaning schedule that I expect everyone to adhere to, and I have rules about keeping common areas clutter-free. I try to keep the kitchen spotless, and I get really irritated if dishes are left in the sink for more than a couple of hours. I've also implemented a rule that we can only have guests over on weekends and that they have to leave by midnight. 

Sarah and Jake have been pushing back. They think I'm too controlling and that my rules are excessive. Sarah says she's exhausted from work and doesn't have the energy to clean every day. Jake feels like my guest policy is unreasonable, especially since his girlfriend can only visit during the week due to her work schedule. 

Things came to a head when I decided to label all of our food items in the fridge and created a chart to monitor who is eating what. I noticed some of my almond milk was disappearing, and I wanted to make sure it wasn't happening again. Both Sarah and Jake were furious, saying it was invasive and that I was treating them like children.

My friends are divided. Some think I'm right to want a clean and orderly home, while others feel I'm taking it too far. My parents even told me I should try to compromise more and relax a bit, but I don't see why I should sacrifice my comfort and standards.

The current outcome is that Sarah and Jake are pretty cold towards me, and tension is high in the apartment. We've had a few heated arguments, and they even suggested we get a mediator or have a house meeting to discuss the rules. 

So, AITA for being too controlling and refusing to compromise with my roommates?","I (28m) live with three roommates in a four-bedroom house. We've had our fair share of disagreements over the past year, but lately, it's been getting out of hand. We're all working professionals, and our schedules can be pretty hectic.

The main issue is cleanliness. My roommates (two guys, Alex and Ryan, and one girl, Mia) tend to leave their dirty dishes and clothes scattered all over the living room and kitchen. I've asked them multiple times to clean up after themselves, but nothing seems to change.

I've started leaving notes and reminders on the fridge, but it's not working. Yesterday, I saw that the living room was a disaster, and I lost my cool. I told them that if they didn't clean up immediately, I would start taking their stuff and putting it in the garage.

Mia got upset and said I was being controlling and unreasonable. Alex and Ryan backed her up, saying that we should just compromise and do chores together as a team. But I don't think that's fair. I'm the one who pays the most rent, and I expect a certain level of cleanliness.

We've had discussions about it before, but I always seem to be the one who has to remind everyone to do their part. I feel like I'm the only adult in the house. I've even offered to pay for a cleaning service to come in once a week, but my roommates shot that down.

Now, Mia is threatening to move out if I don't back off. I'm starting to think she's just looking for an excuse to leave. I'm not willing to compromise on this issue. If they can't keep the place clean, then maybe they shouldn't be living here.

I live in a shared apartment with two roommates, Sarah and Jake. We've been living together for about eight months now. Everything was fine in the beginning, but recently, I've been feeling like I'm the only one who cares about keeping the place in order. \n\nI'm pretty particular about cleanliness and organization. I have a cleaning schedule that I expect everyone to adhere to, and I have rules about keeping common areas clutter-free. I try to keep the kitchen spotless, and I get really irritated if dishes are left in the sink for more than a couple of hours. I've also implemented a rule that we can only have guests over on weekends and that they have to leave by midnight. \n\nSarah and Jake have been pushing back. They think I'm too controlling and that my rules are excessive. Sarah says she's exhausted from work and doesn't have the energy to clean every day. Jake feels like my guest policy is unreasonable, especially since his girlfriend can only visit during the week due to her work schedule. \n\nThings came to a head when I decided to label all of our food items in the fridge and created a chart to monitor who is eating what. I noticed some of my almond milk was disappearing, and I wanted to make sure it wasn't happening again. Both Sarah and Jake were furious, saying it was invasive and that I was treating them like children.\n\nMy friends are divided. Some think I'm right to want a clean and orderly home, while others feel I'm taking it too far. My parents even told me I should try to compromise more and relax a bit, but I don't see why I should sacrifice my comfort and standards.\n\nThe current outcome is that Sarah and Jake are pretty cold towards me, and tension is high in the apartment. We've had a few heated arguments, and they even suggested we get a mediator or have a house meeting to discuss the rules. \n\nSo, AITA for being too controlling and refusing to compromise with my roommates?""}]","{

36,AITA for not going to my girlfriends sons funeral?,"I (28m) have been dating my girlfriend  (30f) for 2 months. I think we had a good relationship, she has a son (11m). My girlfriend and I were good friends for a few years, we met through a mutual friends and so I haven’t spent time with her alone until 5 months ago.  I knew she had a son, because she’s posted about him on Facebook, a few times. He has some sort of liver condition and was awaiting a liver transplant. its just him and his mom. I don’t know much about him, as my gf Is very reserved talking about her son.  I have a little sister (26f). I have always been closer to her than other siblings, considering we’re only a few years apart.  when she was 11, we were fighting at school and she ended up fainting. She had to stay in the hospital for a few days to have some tests done, and she ended up being diagnosed with diabetes, not related to her death.   I think it changed the dynamic of our relationship a lot, because she was in hospital a lot more than other kids.  At the start of September, my gfs son started getting sicker, and it was the first time she ever opened up to me about his health conditions.  In early October my  sister got into an accident. It was very sudden, and because she still lives near my parents they were heartbroken, and they don’t have any children apart from my sister and I, so I went to help them.  I Grew up in Australia, and my sister and my family still live there, I live in America currently. For the funeral and to console my mum and dad, I decided to stay there for 10days to help plan the funeral.  On my second day there, I got a call from my gf. She said her son had passed away during the night, I tried to help her the best I could even though I was already sad about the death of my sister. She said she wanted the funeral to be done soon, and that it would happen on the 6th day of my ten day trip. My sisters funeral was on the 8th and I wasn’t going to take two flights to there and two flights back in less than 2 days to go to both.  My gf got really upset, and said that I didn’t care about her son, and I was upset at her too becuase i had just lost my sister. She told me that her son thought of me like a dad, and I’d never met him so I told her I didn’t think of him like a son. She hung up angrily and we haven’t spoken since.  I’ll admit I was harsh telling her, and a grieving mother didn’t deserve that, however I don’t think I was wrong to push the idea of me being this kids dad.  All my mutual friends think I’m the A-hole for not going, and that I should’ve told her later, but she knows I’ve never met her son, and I wouldn’t ditch my sisters funeral to go to her sons. My friends though think I did the right thing and I wasn’t obligated to go to his funeral.  I don’t know what I should’ve done, I’m glad I went to my sisters funeral but I feel bad for how I told my gf as her sons never had a father figure in his life.  Edit: thank you all for these kind words, I’m very glad for all the support on this. I have read lots of comment before, however I’ve been waiting to give you an update on my and my gf.  My gf and I aren’t together anymore, I’ve cut ties with her, not out of spite as some of the earlier comments said, but because I don’t think seither of us are ready, we are both grieving important people in our lives now.   I have heard from a freind of a freind(also a mutual freind who’s not that close) who’s friends with my ex gf she is still very upset and angry at me for my comment that ‘he’s not my son’ and so I haven’t spoken to a lot of my more distant mutual friends. A lot of them have been friends with my ex gf for years and have heard lots about her son, whereas not much about my sister as it was so sudden, so are still upset at me for not going, so I haven’t spoken to them much either.  Sorry if there is a lot more waffling in this, because I don’t have a character count.",NAH,"Judgement: NAH, Post: I (28m) have been dating my girlfriend  (30f) for 2 months.

My girlfriend and I were good friends for a few years, we met through a mutual friends and so I haven’t spent time with her alone until 5 months ago.  I knew she had a son, because she’s posted about him on Facebook, a few times. He has some sort of liver condition and was awaiting a liver transplant. its just him and his mom. I don’t know much about him, as my gf Is very reserved talking about her son.  I have a little sister (26f). I have always been closer to her than other siblings, considering we’re only a few years apart.  when she was 11, we were fighting at school and she ended up fainting. She had to stay in the hospital for a few days to have some tests done, and she ended up being diagnosed with diabetes, not related to her death.   I think it changed the dynamic of our relationship a lot, because she was in hospital a lot more than other kids.  At the start of September, my gfs son started getting sicker, and it was the first time she ever opened up to me about his health conditions.  In early October my  sister got into an accident.

To give you some background, my girlfriend, Sarah, and I have been together for about a year. She has a teenage son, Jake, from a previous relationship. To be honest, our relationship has always been a bit complicated because Jake has had some serious behavioral issues. He was always getting into trouble, and his relationship with his mother was strained. 

A few weeks ago, Jake tragically passed away. I didn’t know him well personally since he often clashed with Sarah, and I was very much an outsider in their family dynamic. Sarah is understandably devastated, and she has been leaning heavily on me for support. However, I wasn’t particularly close to Jake, and quite frankly, his behavior towards me made it difficult for me to feel a connection. 

When the funeral was announced, I told Sarah I wouldn’t be attending. I explained that I felt it wasn’t appropriate for me to be there since I didn’t have a personal relationship with Jake and I doubted he would have wanted me there. Sarah was furious. In her grief, she accused me of being heartless and outright told me that it felt like I didn’t care. I tried to further explain my perspective, saying that for me, it wasn’t a loss in the traditional sense because we didn’t have a bond, but that didn’t make her pain any less valid. 

After our conversation, some of my friends were split on the matter. Some said I was justified because I had to honor my own feelings and boundaries. Others felt that I should've put my feelings aside to support Sarah during this awful time, even if it meant being uncomfortable.

Now, Sarah and I are at a serious crossroads. She thinks I should have been there for her, and I believe it’s okay to recognize that I wasn’t affected by Jake’s passing the same way she was. I genuinely feel for her loss, but I wonder if I should’ve handled this differently. 

So, AITA for not attending my girlfriend's son's funeral and telling her it wasn't a loss for me?","I know this title sounds harsh, but please hear me out. I (32M) have been dating my girlfriend, Lisa (30F), for about a year. Lisa has a 10-year-old son, Tim, from a previous relationship. I never got super close to Tim, mainly because Lisa and I were still in the early stages of our relationship, and I was taking it slow to give him time to adjust to my presence.

A couple of months ago, Tim tragically passed away in a car accident while he was with his father. Lisa was, understandably, devastated, and I did my best to support her emotionally. The funeral was scheduled for a weekday morning, and I had a crucial presentation at work on the same day that I had been preparing for months.

I spoke to Lisa and told her about the conflict. She was upset but said she understood that work commitments can be hard to rearrange. I promised I would be there for her in every other way possible. I made sure to spend time with her before and after the funeral to provide emotional support, and I even arranged for her close friend to accompany her so she wouldn't be alone.

However, during a particularly emotional moment, I made what I now realize was an insensitive comment. Lisa was crying and said she felt like her whole world had been destroyed. In an attempt to be honest, I told her that while I was incredibly sorry for her loss, it wasn't a personal loss for me because I wasn't that close to Tim. I wanted to convey that I was there for her, but it came out all wrong. 

Lisa was hurt by my comment and said it made her feel like I didn't care about her or Tim. She has since cooled off towards me and doesn't seem as open about her feelings as she used to be. Her family has also been giving me the cold shoulder, and some friends have hinted that I should have skipped the presentation.

My friends are divided. Some say I was just being practical and honest, while others think I should have been more sensitive and attended the funeral regardless. I’m truly torn because I feel that both perspectives have validity.

In retrospect, I see how my words could have been hurtful, and I regret saying them. But at the same time, I had a significant work commitment that I couldn't ignore without serious repercussions. I made an effort to support Lisa in other ways, but maybe it wasn't enough.

Am I the asshole for not attending my girlfriend's son's funeral and telling her it wasn't a loss for me?","This is a throwaway.

I've been in a long-term relationship with my girlfriend (40F) for about 5 years now. She has a son from a previous relationship (20M) who passed away suddenly last week. The thing is, I never really got along with her son. He would often make snide comments about me and would frequently exclude me from social gatherings. My girlfriend's son was also the one who didn't approve of our relationship, and it caused a lot of tension between us.

When my girlfriend told me about her son's passing, I was genuinely sad for her, but I didn't feel the same emotional connection that she did. I thought to myself, 'This is a loss for her, but it's not a loss for me.' I told her that I would be happy to support her in any way I could, but I wouldn't be able to attend the funeral. I didn't want to be there to pretend to be sad and make her feel worse.

My girlfriend was understandably upset when I told her this, and we had a huge argument about it. She said that I was being insensitive and selfish, and that I should be there for her no matter what. I explained to her that I was being honest about how I felt, and that I didn't want to fake it for her sake.

After the argument, my girlfriend gave me some space and time to think about things. I realized that I may have been insensitive, but I also didn't want to be there for the sake of being there. I told her that I would be there to support her in other ways, like helping with arrangements or being a listening ear.

We've been talking about it and working through our issues, but I'm still not sure if I made the right decision. My friends and family think I was out of line for not attending the funeral, but I don't feel like I did anything wrong.

I know I'm gonna get deleted for saying this because it is breaking the rules. So many of you are calling this fake and the fact is, it's not. It is real but it happened in 1999 to my older sister. This is a story my mom boasts about to party guests. I tried staying as close to what she recounts as well as my my sister's side of the story. My mom is proud of what she said, calling it her crowning acheivement of motherhood, and she is as vile as you say. I'm sorry for lying and causing so much anger.

Recently, I made the mistake of experimenting with some minor skips from school—nothing serious, just trying to feel a little more independent and adventurous. It was during those days that I spent time working on my drawing skills and exploring interests I didn’t have time for with a full school schedule.

One day, I confided in my friend Sarah (18F) about some of my escapades, thinking she’d understand where I was coming from. To my shock, she went and told a teacher about it, which led to a meeting with the school counselor. They got concerned about my attendance and started digging into my reasons for skipping. I felt betrayed since I thought friends should keep secrets like that to themselves, especially when it’s about something harmless and personal.

When I found out, I confronted Sarah. I was upset and told her that what she did was incredibly untrustworthy and that she had no right to snitch on me to the school. She tried to defend herself, saying she was worried about me and thought that the school should step in. To me, that felt like a cop-out. I told her that being worried about someone doesn’t justify breaking their trust and that I expected more loyalty from her as a friend. Our argument escalated, and I said a few things in anger that I now regret.

Now, our friend group feels tense, and some of our mutual friends are taking sides. Some believe I should have just let it go and others think Sarah crossed the line. I’ve apologized for my tone but still feel that I had the right to express my frustration. I’m now left feeling like I might have taken things too far and that maybe I should have handled it differently, but I also feel justified in calling her out.

So, AITA for telling off my friend who snitched on me to my school?","I (16M) go to a pretty strict high school where discipline is a big thing. We have a lot of rules, and breaking them can lead to serious consequences. A week ago, I made a stupid decision and skipped a couple of classes to hang out with my friends off-campus. It was the first time I'd done it, and I knew it wasn’t a smart move, but I figured it was harmless.

Well, turns out someone saw us and decided to report us to the school administration. I never thought it would be one of my own friends. My “friend” (16M), let’s call him Jake, ratted us out. The school called me in and gave me detention for a week and a stern warning. My parents were furious, and now I’m grounded for the entire month.

When I found out Jake was the one who snitched, I lost it. I confronted him during lunch in front of a bunch of people and told him off, calling him a “traitor” and a “rat.” He tried to explain that he was just trying to do the right thing and was worried about us getting into more serious trouble, but I was too angry to listen. I told him to mind his own business next time and that he’s no friend of mine.

A lot of our mutual friends are torn. Some think I had every right to be angry, but others believe that Jake did the right thing and that I’m overreacting. My parents said I should have handled it more maturely, but they also believe it’s a lesson learned. Jake hasn’t spoken to me since, and things have been super awkward at school.

I get that skipping classes was wrong and that I deserved some kind of punishment, but getting snitched on by Jake felt like a massive betrayal. Now I'm questioning if I went too far by lashing out at him publicly. So, AITA for telling off my friend who snitched on me to my school?","I've been friends with Rachel for over five years, and we've always been close. We've been through thick and thin together, and our friendship has been through its fair share of ups and downs. However, things took a turn for the worse when I got into some trouble at school for skipping class and violating school policies. Rachel, who is also a part of the student council, found out about it and decided to snitch on me to our principal. I was furious when I found out, and I felt like she had betrayed me.

The day after I got in trouble, I confronted Rachel about what she had done. I was still fuming and feeling pretty hurt by her actions. I told her that she was my friend, and that I trusted her, and that she had no right to betray that trust by snitching on me. I also made it clear that I didn't appreciate her trying to get me in trouble with the school. I was loud and confrontational, and I probably said some things that I shouldn't have.

Rachel was understandably upset by my outburst, and she told me that she was just trying to do what was right. She said that she knew I was getting in trouble and that she was trying to protect me from getting expelled. I didn't listen to her side of the story, and I just kept yelling at her for snitching on me.

Looking back, I realize that I overreacted and said some pretty hurtful things to Rachel. I shouldn't have taken my anger out on her, and I shouldn't have made her feel guilty for doing what she thought was right. I've since apologized to her, but I'm not sure if our friendship can ever go back to the way it was before.

38,AITA for not inviting my friends girlfriend to my Halloween party because I don’t like her?,"Fake names   I (25 F) have been friends with Rob(25 M) since college. We both didn’t really have friends since the college we attended was out of our home states and we often studied together which led to us becoming close friends. Obviously, we are still close but just not as much. We still talk on the phone and hangout occasionally.   Rob started seeing “Ariana” (22 F) during our last year of college. They have been officially dating for two years. As the title shows, we don’t really like each other. Our personalities could not be more opposite. She was/is always into being girly, chatty, and just a lot. It’s just not what I prefer. Also it got worse when me and Ariana got into an argument a year ago during my Halloween party that led us to REALLY disliking each other. I host the Halloween party every year, the Saturday before Halloween. Because of everything I stated, I didn’t invite her again. When Rob called Friday night to asked what “they” should bring I told him I just invited him and not Ariana. He apologized for making an assumption but then told me to count one off the list because he won’t be attending. This upset me because he has never missed my Halloween party before. I asked if she really couldn’t be alone for one night. He said it wasn’t about her it was just his decision to not go somewhere that excluded his girlfriend. The call got awkward and we hung up shortly after. The party on Saturday was great but I did miss my friend being there. I’ve felt guilty all weekend like I made a bad move.

During Covid Theo (25ish M) joined our crew. In the 2 years we have known him, he has NEVER mentioned a spouse. He’s talked about friends and family, his favorite things, what he’s cooking for dinner, everything but that and kind of made himself sound single. A couple of coworkers even asked him out but he declined because he doesn’t date coworkers. I can’t deny he’s VERY good looking which attracted a lot of interest from coworkers.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was walking home from grocery shopping near work and my bag split. A woman help pick up everything and even offered her tote. We chatted and it turns out she was Theo’s WIFE. They had been married for 3 years so before he even started this job. When I introduced myself as Theo’s coworker, it was clear Theo had told her about work and us but I don’t think she realized that we didn’t know she even existed.\n\nWhen I went to work, I casually asked Theo if he was seeing anyone and he shrugged and said work was too busy. I thought it was weird he wouldn’t mention his wife so I messaged her and said we needed to talk.\n\nWe met later at a cafe and I told her that no one knew who she was because Theo never mentioned her. I talked about how women would flirt with him. I mentioned he never wore a wedding ring. She started blinking hard as if trying not to cry. She looked crushed. But she was a sweetheart and paid for my coffee before I even got a chance to.\n\nThe past few days Theo has been very moody. He started buying lunch instead of bringing one from home. He’s been ignoring me which interferes in our work. He cornered me today after work and told me that his wife was sad and he didn’t know why but it was my fault. He told me to never contact his wife or talk about her again. I told my coworkers what happened and everyone expressed shock that he had a wife. A few coworkers said I was an asshole for telling my coworker’s wife that he hid her existence but most took my side. My boyfriend said I was in the right and people would want to know if their spouse was acting shady like Theo.\n\nEdit: is it not normal to chat with people evenif its strangers?

Wasn’t unusual to see your teacher at a bowling alley or your mechanic at the bar.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Expecting My Friend to Prioritize Our Friendship Over His Girlfriend's Feelings?'""}]","I've (28F) been best friends with Mark (28M) since we were kids. We've always had a strong bond and I thought it was unbreakable. Over the past year, Mark started dating Jenna (27F). Initially, I welcomed her into our friend group, and we all hung out together, but things started to change when Jenna began making comments about our friendship.

At first, it was little things, like how we spent too much time together and should include her more, which I brushed off. But then she began to get more direct, expressing that she didn’t like how close Mark and I were. It escalated to her saying that I was a ""bad influence"" on him and suggesting that he should cut back on hanging out with me. Mark seemed to take her side, often canceling our plans to spend time with her instead, which really hurt me.

A few weeks ago, I threw a birthday party for myself and invited Mark, along with a few other friends, of course. I was excited to celebrate together like we always had. Suddenly, the day before the party, Mark told me he wouldn’t be coming because Jenna had planned something for them. I felt pretty crushed, especially after he mentioned he had forgotten about my party in the first place. I sent him a text expressing how disappointed I was that he couldn't make it, and I blurted out that I expected him to prioritize our friendship over his girlfriend’s feelings.

This caused a rift. Mark confronted me about my message, saying I was being unreasonable and selfish. He argued that Jenna was his girlfriend and that he wanted to make her happy. I was taken aback and tried to explain that our friendship was just as important. Our other friends weighed in too, and some sided with me, saying that friendships should stand the test of relationships, while others thought I was being dramatic.

After our argument, things have been tense between us. Mark seems to be distancing himself even more, and it hurts, especially since I feel like I'm losing a lifelong friend over this situation. I know I might have overstepped by expecting him to put our friendship first, but I truly value what we had and miss how things used to be. So, am I the asshole for expecting my friend to prioritize our friendship over his girlfriend's feelings?","My best friend Jake (28M) and I (27M) have been close since high school. We’ve been through a lot together, from college shenanigans to job changes and everything in between. I always thought our bond was unbreakable, and we promised we’d always have each other’s backs.

A year ago, Jake started dating Emily (26F). At first, I was really happy for him. Emily seemed nice, and Jake was genuinely excited about the relationship. However, over time, I started noticing changes. Jake began declining our usual hangouts, saying he had plans with Emily or that she didn’t like the places we used to go. 

The last straw for me was when our favorite band's reunion concert was announced. We had been obsessed with this band as teenagers, and when I got the tickets, I was ecstatic. I called Jake immediately to share the news, expecting him to be just as excited. But instead, he hesitated and said he had promised Emily they’d have a quiet weekend together, as she wasn't big on concerts. I was disappointed and a bit angry. We had been talking about seeing this band if they ever reunited since high school!

I decided to confront Jake about it. I told him our friendship should come first and that Emily should understand that. It wasn’t fair for him to ditch our long-standing plans because of her preferences. Jake looked really taken aback and told me while he values our friendship, Emily is his girlfriend and her feelings are important to him. He said he couldn’t just ignore her wishes and do whatever he wanted all the time and asked me to understand his position. I shot back, saying that real friends don’t ditch each other for someone they’ve known for a fraction of the time.

This led to a big argument, and Jake left looking pretty upset. My other friends have mixed opinions. Some agree with me, saying bros before everything, but others think I'm being unreasonable and that Jake has a right to prioritize his relationship. 

Now, Jake hasn’t been answering my calls or texts, and I heard from a mutual friend that he’s really hurt. Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to put our friendship before his girlfriend's feelings?","Throw away for privacy. Fake names.

I (28 F) have been friends with Alex (29 M) since college. We've been through thick and thin together and I consider him one of my closest friends.

She's always been a bit possessive and controlling, and I've seen the way she treats Alex, always trying to dictate what he does and who he hangs out with. It's like she's trying to suffocate him.

Anyway, Alex and I were planning to go on a guys' trip for a week, just the two of us, to catch up and have some fun. We've been talking about it for months and I was really looking forward to it. But, of course, Rachel found out and freaked out. She sent Alex a bunch of texts and messages, telling him that he can't go on the trip because it would be ""irresponsible"" and that she wouldn't be able to handle it if he went. She even went so far as to say that if he went, she would ""take care of him"" and make sure he didn't have any fun.

I was really disappointed when Alex told me that he was canceling the trip because of Rachel's demands. I felt like he was prioritizing her feelings over our friendship, which is what I've always valued above everything else. I tried to talk to him about it, but he just said that Rachel is his girlfriend and he needs to consider her feelings. I told him that our friendship is more important than any relationship, but he just shut me down.

Now, I feel like Alex is prioritizing Rachel's needs over mine, and it's really hurtful. I feel like he's abandoning me for her, and it's making me question our friendship. AITA for expecting Alex to prioritize our friendship over Rachel's feelings?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""My best friend Jake (28M) and I (27M) have been close since high school. We’ve been through a lot together, from college shenanigans to job changes and everything in between. I always thought our bond was unbreakable, and we promised we’d always have each other’s backs.\n\nA year ago, Jake started dating Emily (26F). At first, I was really happy for him. Emily seemed nice, and Jake was genuinely excited about the relationship. However, over time, I started noticing changes. Jake began declining our usual hangouts, saying he had plans with Emily or that she didn’t like the places we used to go. \n\nThe last straw for me was when our favorite band's reunion concert was announced. We had been obsessed with this band as teenagers, and when I got the tickets, I was ecstatic. I called Jake immediately to share the news, expecting him to be just as excited. But instead, he hesitated and said he had promised Emily they’d have a quiet weekend together, as she wasn't big on concerts. I was disappointed and a bit angry. We had been talking about seeing this band if they ever reunited since high school!\n\nI decided to confront Jake about it. I told him our friendship should come first and that Emily should understand that. It wasn’t fair for him to ditch our long-standing plans because of her preferences. Jake looked really taken aback and told me while he values our friendship, Emily is his girlfriend and her feelings are important to him. He said he couldn’t just ignore her wishes and do whatever he wanted all the time and asked me to understand his position. I shot back, saying that real friends don’t ditch each other for someone they’ve known for a fraction of the time.\n\nThis led to a big argument, and Jake left looking pretty upset. My other friends have mixed opinions. Some agree with me, saying bros before everything, but others think I'm being unreasonable and that Jake has a right to prioritize his relationship. \n\nNow, Jake hasn’t been answering my calls or texts, and I heard from a mutual friend that he’s really hurt. Am I the asshole for expecting my friend to put our friendship before his girlfriend's feelings?""}]","{

Her “tics” are usually not joking, ever 5 seconds, and like last for 10 seconds. In class? Their will be periods of time where she doesn’t tic for HOURS. If you ask about it, she gets very defensive and claims she doesn’t want to talk about it, however she generally talks about it all the time, making it a personality trait at this point. For the OCD, same case. Talks about it all the time. Today I asked her about what variation she has (for context I have been diagnosed with intrusive thoughts, ritualistic behavior ocd about 2 years ago) and she just said “ I don’t know, ocd?” I thought at first huh. Maybe she actually doesn’t know? But the more I think about it it sounds fake. I told her that people actually have issues with these disorders and that she shouldn’t be thinking it’s a cool thing to have. Her reply, “stop yelling at me your going to flare up my ocd”.

Let me give you the backstory first. I’ve known my friend “Sara” for about five years now. We became close in college, and we really bonded over a lot of things, including our shared struggles with anxiety. Recently, however, Sara has opened up about her mental health more and has mentioned she’s dealing with OCD and Tourette's Syndrome. 

Now, I understand that mental health issues can manifest in different ways, and I truly want to be supportive. However, there have been moments where her actions raised some red flags for me and the other friends in our group. For instance, she frequently has these rituals that she insists are linked to her OCD, and while I get that it’s real for her, there are times when it feels exaggerated. 

Things came to a head during a group outing last week. We were at a restaurant when Sara had a noticeable episode where she was repeating certain phrases loudly and meticulously counting her utensils. While I know this could be part of her condition, it felt really out of place in a social setting, and honestly, I was embarrassed for her. I couldn’t help but express this to our mutual friends, and I ended up jokingly saying that maybe she was just faking it for attention. I thought it would lighten the mood, but it backfired horribly.

My comment led to a huge argument. Sara was visibly upset and told me I was being insensitive and ignorant, and she stormed out. Our friends were divided; some felt I was being a jerk, while others thought I was just being honest. I later tried to apologize, but the damage was already done. Sara won’t return my texts, and it feels like I’ve ruined our friendship.

Now I’m sitting here questioning whether I truly crossed a line or if my concerns were valid. I never meant to undermine her experiences; I just wanted to understand them better. AITA for accusing my friend of faking her OCD and Tourette's?","I (27F) have been friends with “Emily” (27F) since we were in middle school. Recently, Emily was diagnosed with OCD and Tourette's Syndrome. I was shocked because I had never noticed any symptoms during our years of friendship. I'm not a medical expert, but it seemed odd to me that these disorders would emerge so suddenly and dramatically.

About a month ago, Emily started talking a lot more about her conditions, especially on social media. She would post about her struggles and how she's trying to cope. I noticed that whenever we were in public or around new people, her tics and OCD behaviors seemed to be more pronounced. At first, I tried to be supportive, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

During a girls' night out last weekend, Emily had several noticeable tics and repeatedly checked her bag and surroundings, which she said were her OCD behaviors. I lost my patience and, in front of our friends, asked her if she was exaggerating or faking her conditions for attention. I know it was an awful thing to say, but I was frustrated because it felt like she was overshadowing everyone else’s issues with her constant need for attention.

The room went silent, and Emily looked hurt. She left the gathering early, and I immediately felt a pang of guilt. The next day, a few of our friends reached out to me saying that I was out of line and that I should apologize to Emily. One friend, however, agreed with me and said she had also noticed Emily's symptoms seem to appear more when there's an audience.

Emily hasn’t spoken to me since that night, and I heard through a mutual friend that she’s really upset. I’m torn because I don’t want to invalidate her experience if she’s genuinely struggling, but I also don’t want to enable attention-seeking behavior if that’s what’s happening. I haven’t reached out to apologize yet because I’m not sure if I should. 

So, AITA for accusing my friend of faking her OCD and Tourette's?","Hi, All!

I've been friends with my coworker, Sarah, for about 5 years now. We work in an office together and have always gotten along great. However, over the past year, Sarah has been making a lot of fuss about her OCD and Tourette's. She's constantly asking for accommodations, like being able to work from home or having a quiet workspace, and claiming that her symptoms are getting worse.

The problem is, I've noticed that Sarah's ""symptoms"" seem to only appear when it's convenient for her. If she's having a bad day or if she's stressed about something, she'll suddenly start complaining about her OCD and Tourette's. And when things go well or she's having a good day, she doesn't mention it at all.

I've also noticed that Sarah has a lot of friends who are more than happy to enable her behavior. They'll excuse her for not doing things or for making excuses, and they'll even go so far as to defend her when I question her behavior.

One time, I even saw Sarah ""ticking"" on purpose in front of our boss, just to get sympathy and attention. It was really obvious that she was faking it, but when I confronted her about it, she denied it and got defensive.

I finally had an honest conversation with Sarah about my concerns, and she got really upset with me. She accused me of not being supportive and not understanding her struggles. I told her that I do understand, but that I've noticed a pattern of behavior that makes me think she's not being entirely honest.

Now, Sarah is barely speaking to me and has started spreading rumors about me behind my back. I feel like I'm being unfairly accused of being insensitive and unsupportive, but I know that I'm not the asshole here.

40,AITA For Wanting To Confront My Future Sister-In-Law,"I (27 F) recently had my bridal shower shower after getting engaged to my fiancé (27 M). Back story: we’ve been together for awhile, 10 yrs, and I’ve know his family for just as long. His sister (25 F) and I are not close but have recently been pretty friendly with each other. We’ve hung out with her and her friends, had her over to ours, and overall have been spending more time together. After the bridal shower, when I was looking through the cards and gifts, I realized she did not gift us anything, not even a card with her well wishes. I can’t help but feel a bit snubbed.

My fiancé's sister, ""Lily,"" has always been a bit of a wildcard. She's the life of the party, always making jokes and being the center of attention, but she's also known for being flippant and not taking things seriously when it comes to family events. I’ve always gotten along well with her, even when she has done some pretty off-the-wall things, but this time I was a bit taken aback.

When I was planning my bridal shower, I assumed that, like most family members, Lily would want to contribute to the celebration somehow—especially since she’s been part of the wedding planning discussions. I was very careful to keep the guest list within my fiancé's family limited to just close relatives, and I made it clear that her presence would mean a lot to me. 

On the day of the shower, I was excited but also nervous. The decorations were beautiful, and the food was amazing. When it came time to open gifts, I felt a wave of disappointment when I saw that Lily had not brought anything. Everyone else had given thoughtful gifts, and when it was Lily's turn, she jokingly said she didn’t believe in bridal shower gifts because they were a “money grab.”

After the party, I expressed my feelings to my fiancé and told him I felt hurt. He said he understood but thought I was being too harsh; he knows Lily’s personality and said I should have expected that. I felt like she could have at least given a card or something small, considering how much effort went into planning the day. 

Now, some of my friends think I should just let it go, saying it’s not the end of the world, but I can’t shake the feeling that it was disrespectful, especially since I was so excited to include her in such a special day. I can’t help but feel that if she truly cared, she would have made some effort to acknowledge it.

So, AITA for expecting a gift from my fiancé's sister at my bridal shower?","I'm getting married in a few months and recently had my bridal shower. It was a lovely event organized by my bridesmaids, and it seemed like everyone had a great time. There was a lot of excitement, laughter, and, of course, gift-giving. I received lots of beautiful and thoughtful gifts from my friends, family, and future in-laws—except from my fiancé’s sister, (25F).

To give some context, my fiancé’s sister and I have never really been close, but we've always been cordial. She's kind of reserved and not the most expressive person. While I was opening gifts at the shower, I noticed she didn't hand me a present. I assumed it might have been left somewhere or that she would give it to me later. But as the day went on, no gift from her appeared.

Later that evening, I casually mentioned it to my fiancé. He brushed it off, saying that his sister isn't big on social norms and maybe she just didn't think it was necessary to bring a gift. He said it wasn't a big deal, but I couldn't help but feel hurt. It's my bridal shower, after all! Everyone else brought something, and her not bringing anything felt like she didn't care about celebrating this milestone with me.

I decided to bring it up with her directly. I tried to keep it light and non-confrontational, mentioning how much I appreciated her being there and just wondered if perhaps her gift got misplaced. She looked surprised and awkwardly said she didn’t realize she was expected to bring a gift, but then said she would get me something if it meant that much to me.

I could tell she was uncomfortable, and now my fiancé is upset with me for making her feel bad. He says I made a big deal out of nothing and that it's not fair to expect everyone to follow the same traditions. Some of my friends think I overreacted and that it’s not worth creating tension over a present, but my mom and some of my bridesmaids believe she should have brought a gift and are on my side.

Now, things are a bit tense between us. I didn’t mean to cause any drama; I just felt like she should have made an effort, considering the occasion. Was I out of line for expecting a gift and bringing it up with her? Am I the asshole?","I've been with my fiancé, Alex (28M), for about 6 years now. His sister, Emily (25F), has always been very close to me. We would often go on family vacations together and she would confide in me about her relationships and personal struggles. She even asked me to be her maid of honor when she got engaged a few years ago.

Fast forward to now, Alex and I are getting married and we've planned a big bridal shower for me. Emily is one of the main hosts, along with our mom, and she's been involved in planning the whole event. We've all been very close and I thought we were on the same page about gift expectations.

However, a few days ago, Emily casually mentioned to me that she hadn't gotten me a gift yet because she's been ""really busy."" I brushed it off and didn't think much of it, assuming she just got caught up with work or something. But when I saw her at the bridal shower, she was wearing a brand new designer watch and had a bunch of new clothes on, which I know she wouldn't have been able to afford on her own.

It wasn't until later that night, when we were all hanging out at the reception, that I mentioned to Alex how I felt a little disappointed that Emily didn't get me a gift. Alex just kind of shrugged it off and said that maybe she just forgot. But when I mentioned it to Emily, she got really defensive and said that I was ""entitled"" and that she had given me ""enough"" over the years by being her sister-in-law.

I felt really hurt and betrayed by her response. I know we're family and I shouldn't expect a gift from her, but I also feel like she should have gotten me something, especially since she's been so involved in planning the bridal shower. Now Alex is telling me that I'm being ""unreasonable"" and that I should just let it go.

41,WIBTA if I confronted my dad about his cheating?,"Context: My (23m) parents have been divorced for a decade, and my dad remarried a couple years later. At the time, I voiced my disapproval of his new relationship, which led to him saying a lot of hurtful things. At their wedding (eight years ago at the time of writing), I discovered he had cheated on my mom with his now wife. I never confronted him about it because I'm convinced he wouldn't care about my feelings and say a bunch of hurtful things again.  I recently realized how holding onto this family secret has negatively affected my life and that it's finally time to confront him. I planned on have a private dinner where I would tell him what I know and ask him to confess to my siblings too, since I'm confident that I'm the only one of the three of us who knows. Where I fear I will be the asshole is that I plan on doing it before a family trip. It has come to my attention that we might be meeting my dad's wife's family on this trip, which is where I draw the line. I have managed to get away with not meeting them before, and I would like it to stay that way because I do not view his wife or her family as my family because of his cheating (I even refuse to call her my stepmom). A part of me is worried that this will cause me to have an outburst on the trip, which further cemented to me why it's time to have this secret out in the open, and that it should happen before we leave. I’m worried, however, that doing it before the trip will cause a lot of tension and am wondering whether if it is better until after the trip to have this conversation.

This year, we decided to go to a beautiful beach resort, and everyone was excited. However, about a month ago, I discovered that my dad was having an affair. I found some texts on his phone while he was in the shower, and I was completely shattered. My parents have been together for over 25 years, and I honestly thought everything was fine.

Once I confronted my dad about it, he tried to deny it at first but then admitted to the affair. I felt a mixture of anger, betrayal, and confusion. I wasn’t sure how my mom would react, but I knew I had to tell her the truth before our trip. I didn’t want her to be blindsided if she noticed something was off or if she found out from someone else.

I sat my parents down a week before the trip and forced my dad to confess to my mom. It was emotionally charged, and my mom was devastated. She had no idea, and I could see her heart break right in front of me. The atmosphere shifted drastically; the excitement of our upcoming trip was replaced with tension and hurt feelings. My dad was furious with me for ruining the trip and for “forcing” him into a confession. He said that I should have kept my mouth shut until after the vacation, suggesting that we could “just enjoy this one last trip as a family” before dealing with the fallout.

My siblings had mixed reactions. Some felt that I did the right thing by being honest, while others thought I should’ve waited. They were worried that all the drama would ruin the trip for everyone. I didn’t want to ruin anyone’s vacation, but I felt it was crucial for my mom to know the truth, especially if my dad had plans to continue seeing the other woman. 

Now, the trip is approaching, and things are still tense. My mom is still processing everything, and my dad is barely talking to me. I feel guilty about the emotional fallout but also believe that it was necessary to expose the truth. 

So, Reddit, AITA for forcing my dad to confess infidelity before our family trip, potentially ruining it for everyone?","I (26F) recently found out that my dad (52M) has been cheating on my mom (49F). I stumbled upon some explicit messages on his phone while helping him with a tech issue. It completely shattered my perception of him. My parents have been married for over 25 years, and I always thought they had a solid relationship.

We're all supposed to go on a big family trip together in a couple of weeks, something we've been planning and looking forward to for almost a year. It’s a rare occasion when all of us—me, my younger brother (22M), my mom, and dad—can get together because we all live in different states now.

I couldn’t keep this information to myself, so I confronted my dad privately and asked him to come clean to my mom before the trip. I told him it was unfair to drag us all on a vacation under false pretenses. He begged me not to say anything, claiming it was a mistake and he had already ended the affair. He said he needed time to fix things on his own terms and that this trip would be a chance for him to start making amends.

I was caught between a rock and a hard place, but I stood my ground and insisted he tell my mom before we left. I couldn’t stand the idea of pretending everything was perfect while knowing the truth. I even gave him a deadline to confess, or else I would tell her myself.

Reluctantly, he confessed to my mom a few days ago. As expected, she was devastated. The atmosphere at home has been tense and uncomfortable since then. Now, there’s talk of canceling the trip altogether because my mom feels too emotionally drained to go. My brother, who had no idea about any of this, is mad at me for instigating the confession before the trip, saying I ruined the only chance we had for a family vacation and that I should have waited until after.

I feel terrible, but I also believe it was the right thing to do. My dad's affair was a ticking time bomb, and I thought it was better to deal with it sooner rather than later. However, seeing how upset everyone is, I’m starting to question my actions.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for forcing my dad to confess his infidelity before our family trip and potentially ruining it for everyone?","I've always been really close to my dad, and we've had a great relationship. He's been married to my mom for over 30 years, and I've always considered their marriage to be a rock-solid one. That was until about 6 months ago when I stumbled upon some suspicious messages on my dad's phone. They were just a bunch of flirtatious texts between him and a woman I'd never met before.

At first, I thought maybe I was just being paranoid and that it was nothing, but after reading through the messages, I became convinced that my dad was having an affair. I couldn't shake the feeling of unease, and I felt like something was off in our family.

So, a few weeks ago, I decided to confront my dad about it. I waited until he was home alone, and then I sat him down and asked him point-blank if he was cheating on my mom. I know it sounds crazy, but I just felt like I had to know the truth. I wanted to know if my whole perception of our family was a lie.

My dad initially denied it, but I could tell he was hiding something. I pressed him for answers, and eventually, he cracked under the pressure. He confessed to the affair, but not before telling me that he had ended it months ago. He said that he was sorry and that he loved my mom and our family.

However, my dad's confession has created a huge rift in our family. My mom is devastated, and my siblings are all really upset about it. We're supposed to go on a family trip in a few days, but now it feels like it's going to be really awkward and tense.

I know I might have ruined the trip for everyone, but I feel like I had to know the truth. I couldn't just ignore my suspicions and pretend like everything was fine. I feel like I did what was necessary to protect my family and our relationships.

I told him it was unfair to drag us all on a vacation under false pretenses. He begged me not to say anything, claiming it was a mistake and he had already ended the affair. He said he needed time to fix things on his own terms and that this trip would be a chance for him to start making amends.\n\nI was caught between a rock and a hard place, but I stood my ground and insisted he tell my mom before we left. I couldn’t stand the idea of pretending everything was perfect while knowing the truth. I even gave him a deadline to confess, or else I would tell her myself.\n\nReluctantly, he confessed to my mom a few days ago. As expected, she was devastated. The atmosphere at home has been tense and uncomfortable since then. Now, there’s talk of canceling the trip altogether because my mom feels too emotionally drained to go. My brother, who had no idea about any of this, is mad at me for instigating the confession before the trip, saying I ruined the only chance we had for a family vacation and that I should have waited until after.\n\nI feel terrible, but I also believe it was the right thing to do. My dad's affair was a ticking time bomb, and I thought it was better to deal with it sooner rather than later. However, seeing how upset everyone is, I’m starting to question my actions.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for forcing my dad to confess his infidelity before our family trip and potentially ruining it for everyone?""}]","{

Read the Title:\nCarefully read the title of the AITA post.\n\n2. Acknowledge the Required Judgement:\nConsider the judgement indicated (NTA - Not the Asshole, NAH - No Assholes Here, ESH - Everyone Sucks Here). Think about the key points you need to make to ensure the story aligns with the required judgement.\n\n3. Generate a Story by Following those Steps:\n\nCreate an AITA post without using section titles. Include the following elements seamlessly in the narrative:\n\nBrief Background: Provide context for the story. Introduce the main characters and their relationships, and set the scene for the events that will unfold.\n\nThe Incident: Describe the specific incident or series of events that led to the conflict. Be detailed and clear about what happened, who was involved, and what actions were taken.\n\nFriends\' or Family\'s Opinion: Describe the opinions of friends or family members about the situation. Include differing viewpoints to provide a balanced perspective on the conflict.\n\nThe Current Outcome: Detail the consequences of the incident. Explain how the people involved reacted, any changes in relationships, and any ongoing impact the conflict has had.\n\nConclusion:\nSummarize the key points of the story and pose similar question to the readers: ""Am I the Asshole for [OP ACTIONS]?""\n\n4. Maintain Authenticity:\nEnsure that the story feels realistic and relatable. Use natural language and tone as if a real person is sharing their experience.\n\n5. Adhere to the Judgement:\nEnsure that the generated story logically leads to the required judgment (e.g., if the judgment is NTA, the story should clearly indicate why the poster might be considered not the asshole).\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for saying someone is short and fat?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A girl (18F) at my school is a fat positivity activist on TikTok.

I said I thought it was all pretty ridiculous, of course.\n\nThe girl and her girls came up to me and my friends at lunch and said that I’m eating fruit salad because of I have disordered eating, which I don’t. She then said “You’re only allowed to walk because you’re tall and skinny, just so you know” in a derogatory way. I said “And you’re not allowed to because you’re short and fat. What’s your point?”\n\nShe yelled “And the mask is off. I was just waiting for you to show your bigotry and insult me.”\n\nHowever, if being fat is an honor and beautiful as she always says, I don’t see how stating she’s fat is an insult or bigoted. I would be pissed if someone called me fat, but that’s because I don’t see it as an honor, and she supposedly does.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: ESH, Title: 'AITA for Believing My Friend's Robbery Story When Everyone Else Thought He Was Lying?'""}]","So, I (22M) have a friend, Mark (23M), who’s had a pretty tough time lately. A few weeks back, he got robbed while walking home late at night. At least, that’s what he told us. He said that two guys jumped him, grabbed his phone and wallet, and left him shaken up. He was visibly upset the next day when he showed up to our friend group hangout, and everyone was initially sympathetic.

However, as the days went by, inconsistencies in his story started to pop up. First, he claimed that the incident happened right near our favorite pizza place, but then he said it was near a grocery store that’s several blocks away. Some friends started whispering behind his back, suggesting that maybe he was making it up for attention or to explain why he was broke and couldn’t pay for anything lately.

I genuinely believed Mark. I know how anxiety-inducing being in such a situation can be, especially living in a city where crime rates are high. I didn't want to jump on the bandwagon of doubt because it felt wrong to me. So, I defended him when others were saying he was lying, insisting that he was going through something traumatic and it was important to support him rather than accuse him of being dishonest.

Things got heated when one of our friends, Lisa (21F), confronted me about it, saying it was absurd for me to believe someone who might just be playing the victim. I snapped and said that whether he was lying or not, he needed friends who believed in him during a tough time, not friends who doubted him. I think I might have come off as overly defensive, and a couple of others started to agree with Lisa.

Eventually, Mark confessed to another friend that he exaggerated the story—he had been in a minor altercation but nothing as serious as he claimed. I felt blindsided, and while I was glad I believed him when others didn't, I also felt betrayed knowing that I defended someone who was essentially lying. 

Now, this has created a rift in our friend group. Some people think I should have seen through his lies and held him accountable, while others appreciate that I stood by him. I’m torn between feeling justified in my support and knowing I might have made everyone else doubt my judgment.

So, AITA for believing Mark’s robbery story when everyone else thought he was lying?","So, here’s the situation. I have this friend, Jake (28M), who I've known since high school. We’ve always been tight, and I've always seen him as an honest, stand-up guy. Recently, Jake called me in the middle of the night, panicked and shaken, saying he had been robbed while walking home from a late shift at work. He described how two guys jumped him, took his wallet, watch, and phone, and ran off. Naturally, I believed him and offered to help however I could.

The next day, I told our mutual friends about what happened, thinking they’d want to support Jake too. To my surprise, they were all skeptical. They started pointing out how Jake has a bit of a history of embellishing stories to get attention. They also mentioned some unusual circumstances about the robbery, like why Jake was walking in a sketchy neighborhood when he could have taken a safer route.

Our friend group started debating whether Jake was telling the truth or making it up for sympathy or money. Jake had asked me to lend him some cash until he could get his cards replaced. I didn’t think twice about it and handed him $200. But when the others found out, they accused Jake of lying and me of being gullible. They brought up that Jake has owed money to different people in our group for a while and said this whole robbery could just be a ploy to get out of his debts.

Jake found out what our friends were saying and got really pissed. He felt betrayed and hurt that so many people doubted him in his time of need. He asked me to cut ties with the ones who didn’t believe his story, saying he didn’t need that kind of negativity.

Things got more complicated when one of our friends, Lisa, who’s a bit of a detective, did some digging and claimed she found inconsistencies in Jake’s story. She said the police had no record of a robbery report matching Jake’s description and that the CCTV footage from the area didn’t show anything unusual that night. At this point, I was feeling torn. I wanted to believe Jake, but Lisa’s findings made me question everything.

Eventually, Jake admitted he might have exaggerated some details but insisted he was genuinely mugged. I felt like an idiot for being pulled into this mess, and our friends are now divided. Some think Jake’s mostly innocent but a bit of a drama queen, while others believe he’s a compulsive liar.

In the end, our group is fractured, Jake’s not speaking to most of us, and I’m stuck in the middle, feeling like I made everything worse by taking sides too quickly. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for believing my friend's robbery story when everyone else thought he was lying?","My friend (25M) Alex and I have been friends since high school. We've been through thick and thin together, and I consider him one of my closest friends. Last week, he called me in a panic, saying that he'd been mugged and robbed in a park while walking home from work. He claimed the guy had a knife and took his phone, wallet, and a few bucks from his pocket.

At first, I believed him and offered to help him get a police report and stuff. But when I told our mutual friends what had happened, they all seemed really skeptical. They said that Alex had a history of exaggerating and lying about things to get attention. Some even mentioned that he'd previously lied about being in a car accident and getting a ticket, but actually got caught driving without a license.

I was torn between believing my friend and not wanting to be a doormat, but also not wanting to believe he'd lied to me again. So, I asked him for more details, like what the guy looked like, what the knife looked like, and what he said to him. He gave me some pretty vivid descriptions, and I started to feel more convinced that it actually happened.

However, when I went to the park with him to look for surveillance footage, he seemed really hesitant and kept changing his story. He said he'd been walking on the other side of the park, but then said he was actually on the side where there are no cameras. I started to feel really uneasy, but I still didn't want to believe that he'd lied to me.

Long story short, the police didn't find any evidence of a robbery, and it turns out that Alex had actually sold his phone and wallet online a few days prior to the ""mugging"". He confessed to me that he'd fabricated the whole story to avoid getting in trouble for his financial mistakes.

Now, I'm feeling really betrayed and hurt that my friend would lie to me like that. But at the same time, I feel like I should've trusted my initial instincts and not believed him in the first place. I mean, everyone else thought he was lying, and it turns out they were right. Was I the asshole for believing him, or was I just a gullible friend?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""So, here’s the situation.

43,AITA for getting upset over a Halloween costume,"Disclaimer i did not make a big deal out of this and its not a huge situation.   Halloween is my absolute favorite holiday and i had been making plans for MONTHS. I came up with so many halloween couple costume ideas for my girlfriend (F26) and i (M21) and had been continuously asking her about which ones she wanted to do. She didnt decide until the month of. With no time to order anything, we had to find/makeshift our costumes. We found everything for her perfectly but we struggled with mine and i ended up having to craft it. I hated how it turned out but decided i was still gonna wear it and have a good time.  She took a piece of my costume to wear for something else she had to do that wasnt any type of event on Friday.  She wanted to look cute. Understandable.  (Halloween party is Saturday and Halloween is Monday)  She liked this outfit so much she decided she was gonna wear it on halloween as a different costume and do our couples costumes for the party. This REALLY bothered me because not only have i been planning this for months and shes changing it but shes also taking a piece of my costume to do it. Also note i already hate my costume as is and she knows this.

He had to craft his own costume, which he hated. She took a piece of his costume to wear to a non-Halloween event, and then decided to wear it as a different costume on Halloween, changing their original plans. The OP is upset and doesn't want to dress up for Halloween, feeling that his girlfriend is being inconsiderate and changing plans without regard for his feelings.

My girlfriend, Mia (23F), and I made plans to throw a big costume party at my place with some close friends. We had picked out our costumes together, and I even spent a good chunk of my savings on decorations and snacks to make it special. It was supposed to be a fun night filled with laughter, music, and all the Halloween vibes!

Fast forward to the day before the party, and Mia calls me while I’m setting up the house. She sounds a bit flustered and tells me she thinks we should go to a different Halloween party instead, hosted by some friends of hers. Apparently, they had a more 'fun' lineup of activities planned, including a spooky movie marathon and a Halloween-themed escape room. I was taken aback because we had put so much thought and effort into our plans, and I thought that meant something to her too.

When I expressed my disappointment, she started getting defensive, saying I was being too rigid and not open to trying new things. I told her it wasn’t just about the activities; it felt like she was undermining what we had planned together. We ended up having a pretty heated argument, with her accusing me of being controlling and me feeling unappreciated for all the work I had put in.

In the end, she decided to go to her friends’ party, and I stayed home alone, feeling really upset. I told some of my friends about the situation, and while they empathized, a lot of them pointed out that I probably overreacted. I’ve been thinking about the whole thing since then, and I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I was too harsh on her for wanting to change plans. 

So, AITA for being angry that my girlfriend changed our Halloween plans at the last minute?","My girlfriend Emily and I have been planning our Halloween celebration for over a month. We were supposed to attend a big costume party with some of our friends. We even coordinated our costumes – I was going to be a pirate and she was going to be a mermaid. I was really looking forward to it because it’s been a while since we both got to let loose and have fun together.

On the day of the party, however, Emily called me while I was at work and said her best friend, Sarah, just went through a bad breakup and is feeling incredibly down. Emily proposed that instead of going to the party, we should stay in and keep Sarah company. She said Sarah could really use some friends around her to cheer her up.

I was pretty annoyed and told Emily that we’ve had these plans for weeks, and it wasn't fair to change them at the last minute. I understand that Sarah is important to her, but I felt like our plans were being completely disregarded. I asked why Sarah couldn’t join us at the party – she could dress up and maybe it would make her feel better. Emily insisted that Sarah wasn’t in the mood for a party and just needed a quiet night in.

This led to an argument where Emily accused me of being insensitive and not caring about her friends. I told her that it’s not about Sarah, but about us always changing our plans for everyone else. In the end, Emily stayed with Sarah and I went to the party by myself. I didn't have nearly as much fun as I expected because I was still frustrated about the whole situation.

When I told some of my friends what happened, they had mixed reactions. Some of them thought my frustration was understandable, but others said I was being selfish and that Emily did the right thing by helping her friend. My mom even chimed in, saying that I should be more supportive of Emily’s decisions, especially when it comes to people she cares about.

Now, Emily and I have been a bit distant, and I can't shake off the feeling that maybe I overreacted. But I also feel like my feelings were valid. Am I the asshole for being angry that my girlfriend changed our Halloween plans at the last minute?","I've been looking forward to Halloween all year, and my girlfriend and I had been planning our annual costume party for months. We even went so far as to book a Airbnb in a creepy old mansion that we've always wanted to visit. We were set to have 15 of our closest friends over, and I had spent weeks crafting a complex, multi-layered costume that I was super excited to show off.

Last week, my girlfriend texts me and tells me that she's decided we're going to a ""small, intimate gathering"" at a friend's house instead. When I asked her why we were changing our plans, she said that she had invited some ""new friends"" from work and didn't want to have a big party with our old friends. I was taken aback - we had specifically told our friends that we were having a costume party, and I had already told them that I was coming as a certain character from a classic horror movie.

When I expressed my frustration to my girlfriend, she told me that I was being ""too controlling"" and that I needed to ""relax"" and go with the flow. I pointed out that I had spent weeks planning our original party, and that I was really looking forward to it. She just rolled her eyes and told me that I was being ""too sensitive"".

To make matters worse, she then proceeded to tell me that she had already RSVP'd to the new party and that I needed to just ""deal with it"". I was furious - I felt like she had completely disregarded my feelings and had just decided to do what she wanted without even considering how I might feel.

I ended up storming out of the apartment and spending the rest of the day by myself, trying to calm down. When I got home, my girlfriend was acting like everything was fine, but I could tell that she was still annoyed with me for being ""so upset"".

I feel like I'm being reasonable here - I had planned a party and she just changed it on me without even discussing it with me first.

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I’m the asshole I get it. I’ll stop bugging him about it'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Considering Lying to My Parents to Contact a Friend I'm Not Supposed to Talk To?'""}]","I've been in a bit of a tough spot lately, and I'm really hoping to get some perspective on whether I'm being unreasonable. I’m 17, and for the past few years, I’ve had a close friendship with a girl named Sarah. We clicked immediately, and I consider her one of my best friends. However, my parents have a pretty strict rule about her because of some past issues with her family that they believe could be a negative influence on me. 

Recently, Sarah reached out to me again after a long while. She’s been going through a rough time, and I really want to be there for her like I used to, but my parents constantly remind me that I'm not allowed to talk to her, insisting it’s for my own good. They genuinely think they’re protecting me, but it just feels so unfair to me. 

So here’s where I may have crossed a line. I’ve been seriously considering lying to my parents about my plans. I want to tell them I’m going out with a different friend when I really plan to meet up with Sarah. I know this sounds terrible, and part of me feels really guilty about it, but I can’t shake the feeling that my friendship with Sarah is worth it. I feel so torn between my loyalty to a friend who needs support and my parents’ rules.

When I tried to talk to my parents about it, they were adamant that I shouldn’t be in contact with her at all, and it became a huge argument. They believe they know what's best for me, but I feel like they’re not even trying to understand my side of things. My siblings think I should just respect my parents' wishes, point blank, even if it's hard for me. 

As I’ve been weighing my options, I can’t help but feel that maybe I’m being selfish for wanting to reignite my friendship with Sarah at the cost of honesty with my parents. But at the same time, I miss her so much and want to help her through her struggles. 

Now I’m left wondering if I’m the horrible person here for considering lying just to contact her. So, AITA for even thinking about this?","I'm a 17-year-old girl, and my parents are pretty strict about who I hang out with and talk to. They believe they have my best interests at heart, but sometimes it feels like they go too far. This is especially true when it comes to my friend, Emma.

Emma and I have been friends since middle school, but she has had her struggles. She got into some trouble last year—she was caught shoplifting with some other kids and got suspended from school for a week. My parents freaked out and forbid me from talking to her. They think she's a bad influence, but I know that Emma is trying hard to turn her life around.

Over the past few months, Emma has been really focused on improving herself. She's been doing well in school, joined a volunteer group, and even got a part-time job. I miss our friendship a lot and want to be there to support her. We've been secretly texting, but it's not the same as spending time together.

Here's where the problem comes in. Emma invited me to her birthday party next weekend. I know if I ask my parents for permission, they'll say no without even considering how much she's changed. So, I've been thinking about telling my parents that I'm going to a different friend's house, just so I can go to Emma's party.

My best friend, Sarah, thinks it's a terrible idea. She says lying to my parents will just make things worse if they find out. She thinks I should try talking to them again, explaining how much Emma has changed and how important our friendship is to me. But honestly, I've tried that before, and they just shut me down.

My cousin, who is a bit older and has had her fair share of clashes with our strict family, says I should go for it. She thinks it's important to maintain my friendships and that sometimes you have to bend the rules a bit when your parents are being unreasonable.

So I did it. I lied to my parents and said I was going to Sarah's house to study. I went to Emma's party, and it was amazing to see her so happy and full of life. Coming back home, I felt a mix of guilt and relief. My parents didn't suspect a thing.

But now, I'm feeling conflicted. On one hand, I got to see my friend and support her, which I believe is important. On the other, I went behind my parents' backs and lied to them, which doesn't sit well with me.

Am I the asshole for lying to my parents to maintain a friendship that I believe is positive and supportive?","So, I've been trying to navigate my way through high school for the past few years, and I've had a bit of a complicated situation with my parents. My parents and I have a pretty strict set of rules when it comes to my social life, mainly because my mom's friends all think she's a terrible parent and they've been a big influence on her. Anyway, one of the rules is that I'm not allowed to talk to my friend Rachel. She's been a bit of a bad influence in the past, and my parents think she's been a bad example to me.

The thing is, Rachel and I have been friends since middle school, and we've been through a lot together. We're not romantically involved, but we've always been close. We share a lot of the same interests and values, and we actually have a pretty positive influence on each other.

Recently, Rachel reached out to me and we started talking again. We've been messaging back and forth, and it's been really nice to catch up with her. However, I know my parents would not approve of us talking again, and if they found out, they'd probably take away my phone or something.

That's when I started considering lying to my parents. I was thinking about telling them that I was going to be studying with Rachel, or something like that, just to get her number and be able to talk to her without my parents knowing. I know it's not the right thing to do, but I feel like I'm being forced to choose between my parents and my friend.

My friends think I'm being stupid for even considering lying to my parents, and they're all telling me to just be honest with them. But I'm not sure if that's the best idea. If I tell them that I'm talking to Rachel again, they'll probably freak out and make me feel guilty for disobeying them.

Coming back home, I felt a mix of guilt and relief. My parents didn't suspect a thing.\n\nBut now, I'm feeling conflicted. On one hand, I got to see my friend and support her, which I believe is important. On the other, I went behind my parents' backs and lied to them, which doesn't sit well with me.\n\nAm I the asshole for lying to my parents to maintain a friendship that I believe is positive and supportive?""}]","{

45,AITA for yelling at my bf that I am not a perfect souffle?,"New account since this is my first time on reddit  I (28NB) love and am living with my bf (30M). For some context my bf loves to bake. I support him with it since he gets to do what he loves and I get to eat his yummy food. His favorite dish to make is a chocolate souffle which is great seeing as I love chocolate souffles. However, lately he's been calling me his perfect souffle and that I'm just perfect the way I am. We have just started trying for a baby and him calling me 'perfect' made me feel insecure as he had commitment issues in the past that he has been in therapy for 5 years for it. One day after going to the doctor and making sure everything is ok, I'm not feeling well and he comes in. He washes up then comes behind me and calls me perfect again. At this point I lost my temper and asked him if he didn't want us to be trying for a baby because my body will be different when I get pregnant? He went quiet and told me he was just trying to tell me that he appreciated me and my body before I got pregnant and insecure about my body. I felt really bad seeing as he was trying to do something sweet but went about it making me feel bad. I apologized and he accepted it but something still feels off. My sister told me I should upload her so Reddit, AITA?  EDIT: Thank you all for the comments. I realize how unfair I was to my bf so I apologized to him again and we had a really long talk.

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I’m the asshole I get it.

We have a really good dynamic, and we generally communicate well. We're both in our early 30s, and while we don't live together, we spend a lot of time at each other's places, and things have been feeling pretty serious.

Recently, we were having a cozy night in, just watching a movie and sharing snacks. Everything was perfect; the ambiance was nice, and we were both relaxed. In the middle of one of those quiet moments, my partner turned to me, looked me in the eye, and said, “You’re just perfect.” I froze. I can't explain why, but I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me. I started to panic and blurted out, “No one is perfect! It’s not real!” I basically freaked out, and I could see my partner’s expression change from warm affection to confusion.

After my outburst, I went on to explain that I have a hard time accepting compliments and that I feel this pressure whenever someone praises me like that. I’ve struggled with feelings of inadequacy for most of my life, and hearing something so seemingly ideal made me feel like I was bound to disappoint. 

My partner tried to reassure me, saying that they were just expressing how much they appreciate me, and that nobody is expecting perfection from me or anyone else. But I just kept spiraling, worrying about how I might not live up to that standard. After a while, the mood shifted from cozy to awkward, and the evening ended in an uncomfortable silence.

In the days following, I kept thinking about what happened, and I felt like I had ruined a perfectly nice moment. I couldn't help but wonder if I overreacted. A few friends have said I was too harsh and that I need to work on accepting compliments, while others have said it’s understandable to feel that way given my history. 

Now, looking back, I'm starting to feel guilty for reacting the way I did. My partner was being sweet and genuine, and I just freaked out. So, am I the asshole for overreacting when my partner said I was ""perfect""?","My partner and I have been together for about a year now, and things have been going really well.

We were having a cozy night in, just watching movies and enjoying each other’s company. Out of nowhere, he turned to me, looked into my eyes, and said, ""You’re perfect."" Instead of feeling flattered or happy, I completely freaked out. I told him that I’m not perfect and that he shouldn’t put me on a pedestal.

They said it sounded like a sweet, genuine compliment, and I should have taken it as such.

I feel awful now, especially seeing how my partner has been quieter than usual, clearly affected by how I reacted. I’m starting to wonder if I really did overreact and if I should have just appreciated the sentiment behind his words instead of nitpicking.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for freaking out when my partner said I was ""perfect""?","Hey everyone,

So, my partner and I have been together for about five years now. We've been through a lot together, and I've always felt like we have a strong, honest relationship. Recently, we were having a conversation about our future together, and my partner said something that completely caught me off guard. They said I'm ""perfect"" for them. I mean, I've heard people say that in a joking way before, but this was said in a completely serious tone.

The thing is, I'm not perfect. I have flaws, just like anyone else. I'm a bit of a control freak, I can be anxious at times, and I've definitely made mistakes in our relationship. But what really bothered me was that my partner said it like it was some kind of fact. Like, I'm just naturally perfect for them, without any effort or work on my part. It made me feel like they're not seeing me as a real person, but more like a fantasy or an ideal.

I freaked out on them, to be honest. I told them that I'm not perfect, that I'm working on myself every day, and that it's not fair to make me feel like I'm somehow above others. I also told them that it's not healthy for them to have such high expectations of me, and that it's putting a lot of pressure on our relationship.

My partner was taken aback by my reaction, but they didn't really try to understand where I was coming from. They just kept saying that they love me and that I'm perfect for them. I know they love me, but it feels like they're not listening to me when I try to express my concerns.

Now, my partner is giving me the silent treatment because I ""overreacted"" to what they said. I feel like they're not taking my feelings seriously, and that's really hurtful.

So, AITA for freaking out when my partner said I was ""perfect""? Was I being unreasonable, or did they have no right to say something that made me feel so unheard and unvalued?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'My partner and I have been together for about a year now, and things have been going really well.

I (22M) have a friend, Sarah (21F), who I've known since high school. We've always had a close friendship, but recently, things have gotten a little complicated. Sarah started an OnlyFans account a few months ago. She's always been pretty open about her life and choices, so I wasn't too shocked when she mentioned it in passing. However, she wasn't aware that some of our mutual friends were also subscribed to her.

The thing is, one of our mutual friends, Emily (22F), has been feeling a bit off about Sarah's new venture. Emily isn't judgmental per se, but she has a more traditional view of relationships and self-presentation, and she’s expressed discomfort with only feeling like she knows half of what’s going on in Sarah’s life. Recently, she told me that she’s been questioning whether she should confront Sarah about it. She thinks Sarah might be putting herself at risk in some way, and it would be better for her to know that it’s out there and that some of our friends are aware.

I find myself caught in the middle. I care about both of them, and I get where Emily is coming from. I understand her concern for our friend, but I also don’t want to be the one who ends up causing unnecessary drama. If I were to tell Sarah that Emily knows about her OnlyFans, it might lead to a confrontation or even hurt feelings. But I also feel that Sarah has a right to know if people close to her might be discussing it behind her back.

I haven’t said anything to either of them yet. Emily thinks it would be a good idea to approach Sarah, but I’m hesitant about that. I’m not sure if it would be better for me to stay out of it or if I should talk to Sarah directly about the fact that Emily is aware.

Neither Sarah nor Emily is in the wrong for how they feel, but I feel guilty for potentially keeping a secret from one of my closest friends. Am I the asshole for even considering telling Sarah about her OnlyFans account being known among our friends?","So, this situation has been weighing on my mind, and I really need some perspective on whether I'm doing the right thing.

One of my closest friends, let's call her Sarah (26F), has recently started an OnlyFans account. I found out about it accidentally when a mutual acquaintance mentioned it in passing. To be clear, I have zero negative feelings about people using OnlyFans or any other platform to make money. It's her body, her choice, and I support that fully.

However, the issue arises because Sarah hasn't told me or our close friend group about her OnlyFans. We typically share pretty much everything about our lives, so this came as a bit of a surprise. I started worrying that maybe she felt embarrassed or thought we would judge her, which is absolutely not the case.

I've been wrestling with whether or not to bring this up with her. On one hand, I want her to know that I support her and that she doesn't need to hide this part of her life from me. On the other hand, I worry that bringing it up might make her feel awkward or invade her privacy. She has every right to keep this to herself if she wants to, and I don't want to push her into a corner where she feels she has to explain herself.

I spoke to a couple of friends about it, and they had mixed opinions. Some thought it was my duty as a friend to let her know I support her and to ensure she doesn't feel isolated. Others argued that if she wanted to share this part of her life, she would do it in her own time and on her own terms. Confronting her about it might just make things weird between us.

For now, I've decided to just act normal and continue supporting her like I always do. But the concern and conflict in my mind still persist. I want to be a good friend but without overstepping boundaries. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for considering bringing up Sarah's OnlyFans account with her?","So I've been friends with my coworker Rachel for about a year now, we've become pretty close and often grab lunch or coffee together. She's always been open and honest with me, sharing stories about her personal life and relationships. Recently, I found out through a mutual friend that Rachel has started an OnlyFans account. I'm not really sure what to make of this - I know she's an adult and it's her choice, but it still feels a bit weird to me.

My issue is that our workplace has a pretty strict social media policy, and I'm not sure if OnlyFans is allowed or not. I'm also worried that our boss might find out and it could reflect poorly on us. Rachel has been getting pretty tight with our boss lately, and I don't want her to get in trouble.

I've been thinking about casually mentioning it to Rachel, maybe just to get her thoughts on it or to remind her of the company policy. I know she's an adult and can make her own choices, but I also feel like I'm looking out for her best interests. My friends who know about this think I'm being a bit nosy, but they also agree that it's not a bad thing to remind her about the company policy.

WIBTA if I bring it up with Rachel, or am I just being a busybody? I feel like I'm coming from a good place, but at the same time I don't want to be prying into her personal business. I've never seen her OnlyFans posts, and I'm not planning on it - I just want to make sure she's aware of the potential implications.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""So, this situation has been weighing on my mind, and I really need some perspective on whether I'm doing the right thing.\n\nOne of my closest friends, let's call her Sarah (26F), has recently started an OnlyFans account.

47,AITA for assuming my boyfriend was letting his boss listen to our private phone call?,"I (25M) and my bf (28M) have been together for 6 years.

I later texted him “I’d appreciate if you didn’t let your boss listen to emotional conversations.

We communicate well, and I thought we understood each other's boundaries. Recently, however, something happened that really shook me.

A few days ago, I was venting to him about a difficult situation I was having at work. It was a private conversation, and I was sharing my feelings, frustrations, and some personal details about why I was feeling overwhelmed. I trusted him to keep that information just between us, especially since it was quite sensitive.

To my shock, later that week, he mentioned to me that he had shared some of the things I said with his boss. He claimed that he did it to ""get advice"" on how to deal with similar situations since he thought I was being too hard on myself. I was taken aback. I felt completely betrayed; the conversation was supposed to be private, and I didn't give him permission to share it. 

When I confronted him, he downplayed my feelings, saying I was overreacting because it was all in a professional context and that his boss ""wouldn't think less of me."" I just couldn't believe he didn't see how sharing my personal struggles felt like a violation of trust. My friends think I’m justified in being upset and that it's important for couples to be able to share their feelings without fear of being outed, but he insists it was done with good intentions.

Now, there seems to be a bit of distance between us. I feel uncomfortable talking about personal matters, and while I don’t want to end things over this, I can’t shake off the feeling of betrayal. I’ve been wondering if my reaction was too extreme. 

So, AITA for getting upset with my boyfriend for sharing my private conversation with his boss?","My boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) have been together for three years. He recently got a promotion at his job, and his boss has been taking a lot of interest in him, even inviting him out for drinks and weekend activities. I know he’s excited about these new opportunities, but something happened recently that has me really upset.

Last Wednesday, I had a rough day at work and came home feeling stressed and overwhelmed. I poured my heart out to my boyfriend about how I was feeling underappreciated at my job and how my coworkers were making my life difficult. He was very supportive and listened to everything I had to say.

Fast forward to Friday night, my boyfriend and I went out for drinks with some of his coworkers, including his boss. At one point, the conversation turned to work-related stress, and my boyfriend decided it was a great idea to share the details of my tough week, including the private conversation we had. He joked about how I was ""losing it"" at work and how dramatic I was being. I was mortified and felt completely betrayed.

I confronted him about it afterward and told him that it was incredibly inappropriate to share something so private, especially in front of people I barely knew. He apologized but then said I was overreacting and that it wasn’t a big deal. He argued that he was trying to connect with his boss and coworkers and that they didn’t take it seriously anyway. He said something about how I ""need to lighten up"" and that I was making something small into a big issue.

I told my friends about this, and they had mixed reactions. Some said they understood why I was hurt, but others agreed with my boyfriend and said it wasn’t worth causing a big fight over. Now, my boyfriend is being distant, and I’m wondering if I really did overreact. 

So, AITA for getting upset when my boyfriend shared our private conversation with his boss?

Edit: Wow, thanks for the feedback. It’s clear I have some thinking to do. I guess I didn’t consider how he might have seen my reaction. We’ll need to have a serious conversation about boundaries.","Throwaway.

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year now, things have been going great and we've been getting pretty serious. We were at his place, just chillin', when I casually mentioned something to him about a conversation I had with his boss a few weeks ago. I thought nothing of it, just small talk, and mentioned a few things his boss said in that conversation. 

It turned out my boyfriend had shared the same conversation with his boss a day prior, and his boss had freaked out and told him that I had been saying some pretty negative things about the company and the boss specifically. I was shocked - I had no idea he had shared it with anyone, let alone his boss. I told him I had been joking around and didn't mean any of it, but he immediately jumped down my throat, saying I had been unprofessional and put him in a bad position. 

The thing is, I was just messing around, I'm a pretty sarcastic person and I don't take things too seriously. But to him, it was a huge deal. He said I had disrespected his workplace and his boss, and that I had embarrassed him in front of his colleagues. I tried to explain that I was just joking, but he wouldn't listen. 

The thing that really got me was when he said I should be more considerate of his job and his reputation. Like, I get it, but I'm not trying to hurt his career or anything. I'm just trying to be myself. I felt like he was being super controlling and judgmental, and that he didn't trust me to be myself around his colleagues. 

We got into a huge fight about it, and I ended up storming out of the apartment. I'm still hurt about it, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk to him about it. I feel like he overreacted and that I was unfairly judged.

We turned 16 a few weeks ago, and in our family, birthdays are a big deal. Traditionally, we each get a thoughtful gift from our parents, but I never expected the gift exchange to spark this much tension.

When I opened my birthday present, I found a brand-new tablet. It wasn’t just any tablet; it's the most expensive model on the market. I was initially excited, but then I realized my brother got the same exact gift last year. I couldn’t help but feel a little frustrated—after all, we’re twins, and I thought we were supposed to have separate identities, including our birthday gifts. I felt like I was being shortchanged because I didn’t get something unique to me.

Later that evening, while talking to my friends, I expressed my feelings about the gift and how I thought I deserved something a bit more special, considering it was my 16th birthday. They were divided—some agreed that I should have gotten a more personalized gift, while others told me that it was selfish to think that way when a tablet is still a substantial gift.

When we had dinner that night, I brought it up with my parents, explaining that I felt a bit entitled to something different and more “me.” My dad just looked at me, surprised, and said that it was unreasonable to expect a more expensive gift when the one I received was already a luxury. He reminded me that the tablet was a great gift and that I should be grateful, but I didn’t feel like I could just let it go.

After dinner, my mom came to speak with me privately. She said that my reaction was disappointing and that I shouldn’t compare myself to my brother. She suggested I focus on being thankful for what I had. I felt really conflicted because I didn’t mean to offend anyone, but I still felt like I deserved something different.

So, am I the asshole for feeling entitled to a more expensive and unique gift since my twin got a tablet?","I (16F) have a twin brother, Alex. We generally get along great, but the past few weeks have created some tension. Our birthday was last month, and our parents usually try to keep things fair between us, making sure we get similar gifts or experiences. This year, however, things were quite different.

On the morning of our birthday, we both received our gifts. I got a beautiful necklace and a few books I had been wanting, while Alex got a brand-new tablet. I was happy with my gifts at first, but as the day went on, I couldn't help but feel a bit resentful. The tablet was clearly much more expensive than my gifts combined. 

During the family dinner that night, I brought up my feelings. I told my parents I felt it was unfair that Alex received a significantly more expensive gift and that I should have received something of equal value. My dad explained that Alex had been saving up for the tablet for months and only needed a little extra to afford it, so they decided to give him the tablet as a combined gift and reward for his hard work. They also mentioned that I could always save up for something I really wanted, and they would consider helping me out as well.

Still, this didn't sit well with me. I felt like they favored Alex, and I was hurt that they didn't think to balance out the costs of our gifts. I ended up sulking for the rest of the evening, which caused a bit of an awkward atmosphere.

My friends are divided on this. Some agree with me and think it's unfair, while others believe I was being entitled and should be grateful for what I received. My parents were clearly disappointed in my reaction, and Alex barely speaks to me now unless necessary. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for feeling entitled to more expensive gifts since my twin got a tablet?","I have a twin sister, Emily. We're 10 years old. Our parents usually get us a gift on our birthdays, but we also get each other a small gift because we're twins. This year, our parents got Emily a tablet for her birthday and a few weeks later, they got me a toy robot for mine. 

I thought the toy robot was really cool and I was happy with it, but I couldn't stop thinking about Emily's tablet. I kept seeing her play games on it and I thought it was really unfair that she got such a cool gift and I got a toy robot. I started feeling like I deserved a tablet too. 

I told my mom that I wanted a tablet just like Emily's and she told me that she already got me a great gift, that the toy robot was expensive and I should be happy with it. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was entitled to a tablet. I started whining and complaining about my gift and my mom got frustrated with me. 

She told me that just because Emily got a tablet, it doesn't mean I deserve one too. She said that each of us gets a gift that's chosen just for us and that I should be grateful for what I got. But I kept feeling like it's not fair that Emily got something so much better than me. 

Now I'm starting to feel bad for being so entitled, but at the same time, I still feel like it's not fair that I didn't get a tablet like Emily did.

They also mentioned that I could always save up for something I really wanted, and they would consider helping me out as well.\n\nStill, this didn't sit well with me. I felt like they favored Alex, and I was hurt that they didn't think to balance out the costs of our gifts. I ended up sulking for the rest of the evening, which caused a bit of an awkward atmosphere.\n\nMy friends are divided on this. Some agree with me and think it's unfair, while others believe I was being entitled and should be grateful for what I received. My parents were clearly disappointed in my reaction, and Alex barely speaks to me now unless necessary. \n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for feeling entitled to more expensive gifts since my twin got a tablet?""}]","{

49,AITA for not letting my family adopt a pet?,"2 years ago my dog died, she was very important to me and I broke down when it happened. I'm currently 20yo and my 2 little sisters are 17 and 15 I still live with my parents and I plan to move in about 2 years. Few months after my dog died, my sister brought up the idea of bringing a new dog to the family, I strongly disagreed because I didn't want to replace my dog but the real reason is that seeing other pets just make me ferious. I don't know how to explain it but I used to like pets and since then I really try to avoid them, but having them in my house (for example when my sister takes care of her friend's dog for few days when they are on vacation) makes me really furious and I hold myself from bursting out. Its reaching the point where I try to avoid coming back to my own house when I know there is a pet there.  Until now my mom respected my disagreement and didn't bring a dog no matter how much my sisters begged. But now my sister started feeding a stray cat that wandered to our garden, she named him and let him in the house a little. Even my big brother (22yo) started liking him which makes me even more mad since he had absolutely no affection to my dog unlike my 2 sisters who loved her.  Now everytime I see this cat I hiss him away and don't let him in the house when he tries to enter. My entire family yells at me to stop it but I just can't. My sisters say they really want their own pet before they leave the house. So am I the asshole for ruining every chance they have of it? I hate it when they say they want their own pet because my dog was theirs too and they loved her. I am barely in the house because I work late but I don't want to come back to a house with a pet that will just make me angry all the time (even just thinking about a pet in the house makes me mad, I don't have to be in the same room with it)",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Post: 2 years ago my dog died, she was very important to me and I broke down when it happened.

The whole process of saying goodbye was overwhelming and the grief hit me harder than I expected. After the funeral, I felt a wave of emotions crashing down on me, and unfortunately, I let my frustrations spill over into my daily life.

One day, while I was out for a walk to clear my head, I came across a stray cat. It was meowing loudly and looked like it was in rough shape. Instead of feeling compassion for it, I felt all my pent-up anger and sadness bubbling to the surface. Without really thinking, I kicked some dirt at the cat, hoping it would just go away. It ran off, and I felt even worse, but I couldn't shake this overwhelming sense of annoyance and helplessness.

Later that week, my siblings (28F and 25M) asked me if I’d like to help them choose a pet for their new apartment. I immediately shot them down, saying that we shouldn't adopt an animal when there are so many issues in the world to deal with. They just wanted a companion to help them deal with their own stress, but I couldn't see past my grief and kept insisting that they should wait and reconsider, acting like having a pet was irresponsible.

My siblings were disappointed and hurt by my reaction, and they've since decided to hold off on getting a pet, which has seemed to drag out their own sadness. They talked about how my reaction made them feel guilty even wanting a cat or dog, and honestly, I can see now how selfish I was being. They just wanted something to care for and love during a tough time, and I took that away from them out of my own anger and frustration.

I feel terrible about how I treated that stray cat and how it affected my siblings. I know now that I shouldn’t have allowed my grief to manifest in such a harmful way. I’ve apologized to my siblings, but I still can’t shake the feeling that, by taking out my emotions on that cat and discouraging their plans, I somehow ruined something for them. AITA for how I acted?","I (35F) recently lost my beloved dog, Max, who had been with me for over 10 years. Max was practically family, and his passing hit me hard. During this tough time, a stray cat started hanging around my backyard. I was in no mood to care for another animal so soon, and I found its presence irritating rather than comforting. I shooed it away every chance I got. 

My younger siblings (18M and 20F) still live with our parents and have been begging for years to get a pet, but our parents have always been on the fence about it. Recently, they seemed to be warming up to the idea. My siblings visited me a lot after Max's death to offer support, and they noticed the stray cat at my place. They fell in love with it instantly and convinced our parents to meet the cat in hopes of adopting it.

I can't explain it, but seeing them so happy about the cat felt like a betrayal to Max. I told my parents that the cat was a nuisance, always digging in the trash and being a general pest. I exaggerated its behavior and told them it would be too much trouble. I even mentioned that the cat might have diseases, which scared them off. I knew my siblings were really looking forward to it, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was too soon for another pet in our family.

My siblings were devastated when my parents decided against adopting the cat. They tried to change their minds, but my parents stood firm, largely based on my exaggerated claims. My siblings found out that I had influenced our parents' decision and are now furious with me, accusing me of taking out my grief on the cat and ruining their chances of having a pet.

I feel guilty now, seeing how upset they are. The stray cat still roams the neighborhood, and my siblings won’t speak to me. I realize I might have let my grief cloud my judgment. So, AITA for taking out my grief on a stray cat and making it difficult for my siblings to get a pet?","I've always been a bit of a cat lover, but my family has always been hesitant about getting one because of my allergies. However, after my mom passed away last year, my dad decided that we needed a pet to fill the void in the house. My siblings, who have always been animal lovers, were over the moon when they found out we were getting a cat.

Fast forward a few months, and we brought home a beautiful stray cat that my siblings had been fostering. I was initially excited to have a pet in the house, but things quickly took a turn for the worse. The cat would wake me up in the middle of the night, scratching at my bedroom door and demanding to be let in. It was disrupting my sleep, and I was already feeling anxious and grief-stricken.

I started to take it out on the cat, yelling at it and refusing to feed it. My siblings were appalled, but I just couldn't handle it. I felt like the cat was somehow replacing my mom, and I was resentful of that. I knew it wasn't fair to the cat, but I couldn't help how I felt.

Things got to the point where my siblings were having trouble getting the cat to eat, and it was clear that I was making it difficult for them to care for the pet. They tried to talk to me about it, but I just got defensive and angry. I even went so far as to tell them that they could take the cat to the shelter if they wanted to, because I didn't want to be responsible for it.

Looking back, I realize that I was taking out my grief on the cat and making it difficult for my siblings to care for it. I'm not proud of how I behaved, and I feel terrible for putting my emotions on the cat. My siblings are still trying to care for the cat, and I'm trying to be more understanding and supportive. But I know that I was a jerk, and I'm hoping that others will see it that way too.

50,AITA that I've been ignoring my mom because she crossed the line?,"Story: I (Me) was playing a game which I had a hard time fighting the boss and sometimes I would vent in silence (if I can say it like this) so I won't disturb her (Mom) since we were in the same room. I don't remember the conversation since I have been trying to forget about it. Anyway, she said:  Mom: ""why am I getting mad at this game? It's dumb to get mad on things like this"" and other things that started to anger me more and more.  Me: ""That's why everyone is getting mad because of you.""  Mom: ""Oh, Really?"" With an annoying tone.  Me:""Yes, Me, Dad, my brother all the time""  She then started to compare me to my brother who did some stuff in the past too which were bad, but I rather not say what he did.  Then I remained silent. When I get frustrated I always end up crying, I can't control it at all. When she saw me crying:  Mom: Oooh? You are crying? She then started to make those sobbing noises which made me get angrier.  Me: It would've been better if women didn't have- and my dad stopped me from saying it.  I kept playing a little until she was saying something. I ignoring her so I couldn't hear what she said.  I went downstairs and vented a lot and decided to not to talk with her or help her at anything or even have an eye contact.  When she was telling me something, I didn't answer. When I said Good night once, I only said to my dad, she said good night and I answered ""I didn't say it to you"" and she answered ""What did you said?""  Now from the present day, I was still ignoring her. I was playing the same game again without getting mad (got better items). Both my mom and dad were getting ready to sleep and she said:  Mom: ""How much you have left there?""  Me: ""Stays silent""  Mom: ""You are staying up for too much (it is 11PM) and you have school tomorrow""  Me: ""Still says silent""  Mom: ""For acting tough, you will see that computer broken one day""  Me: ""Remains silent""  She then went to sleep, my dad has a problem at his toe and the nail is pushing his flesh or it's inside. Ingrown nail, I don't know exactly. Whatever, a few minutes passed until she said:  Mom: OP turn on the lights, hurry. Your dad's toe is inflamed. Look!  Because I heard this, I turned them on. Looked at his toe and see it. But it was a prank and she caught my hand while giggling she said:  Mom: ""Come on, let me hug you!""  I refused and she went silent.

Fake names.\n\nI (37 F) decided a couple months ago with my husband (40 M) that it was time to get our kids a dog because they were old enough to care for one. My kids are Rose (8 F) and Isabella (10 F). My husband had a boxer as a kid and said that he has fond memories with that kind of dog so we decided to get one and surprise the kids. He is now five months old. I\'m sure many of you will understand that because he is a puppy he needs a lot of exercise because he is very high energy. We often take him on walks at the park near our house because it has several very long walking paths.\n\nWell, this past weekend there was an event going on at the lower half of the park, so it was closed off so all we had left was the top half. It was just me and my daughter Rose because my husband had to pick up Isabella from a friend\'s house. While at the park my daughter kept begging me to hold Coopers leash. After a while I gave in. While Rose was walking him another dog came by and Cooper got excited and started running over which pulled my daughter who let go of the leash. Cooper ran over to the other dog trying to play and all of a sudden I heard screaming at me to ""get my dog"". My daughter ran over and started crying while the girl (2oish F?) held her dog down with her arm in his mouth and screamed at me to stop standing there. The man with her started yelling at me to stop my dog who was jumping with excitement. After the shock wore off, I rushed over and removed my dog checking Cooper and Rose. The man with her started yelling at me that I was being irresponsible by letting the dog walk free in a leash required area and that people like them take their rescues there for training and I probably just destroyed months work of progress with their dog. I explained he was being held but my daughter dropped by accident and that he needed to stop yelling as it was scaring my kid. He started yelling that if my daughter wasn\'t strong enough to hold the dog she shouldn\'t be walking it or take it to a unleashed area to practice. When we got home Rose was still crying. When my husband asked what happened and I told him, he was angry at me telling me that I need to be more responsible and that I was at fault. I told my mother about it and she told me that dogs like the girls shouldn\'t be allowed to go to parks and I agree. AITA?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Holding a Months-Long Grudge and Being Cold to My Mom After a Fight?'""}]","I (28 F) have always had a complicated relationship with my mother (60 F). Growing up, she was often critical and dismissive of my choices, which really shaped how I view our interactions today. Recently, we had a big fight that seemed to push everything over the edge. 

A few months ago, I decided to take a big step in my life and quit my job to pursue my passion for photography full-time. It wasn’t an easy decision, and I did a lot of research and planning before making it. When I told my mom, instead of being supportive, she immediately accused me of being irresponsible and implied that I was throwing my life away. She went on to say that I'd be living in her basement in no time if I didn't get my act together. 

That hurt a lot. I had really put my heart into this decision and hoped for some encouragement, but all I got was judgment. Our conversation spiraled into a big argument, and I ended up telling her that I didn’t want her negativity in my life anymore. It was an emotional moment for both of us, and I hung up feeling pretty drained.

Since then, I've definitely been holding a grudge. I haven't reached out to her or responded to her texts, and whenever we do see each other at family gatherings, I find myself being cold and distant. I know some family members have noticed the tension because my mom has reached out to them, expressing her hurt feelings. Some relatives have told me that I need to let it go, that she's still my mother, and that we should just move past it. 

On the other hand, my best friend is more in tune with my feelings and thinks that I have every right to feel upset and to take my time in healing from our argument. She says it’s okay to stand my ground when it comes to my choices, especially since I've been so hurt by my mom’s reaction. 

I’ve been wrestling with whether I’m being too harsh. Part of me feels justified in being distant, while the other part worries that I'm just making things worse. I don't want to hurt her, but I also want her to understand the impact of her words. AITA for holding onto this grudge and being cold to my mom after our argument?","I (24 F) have always had a somewhat rocky relationship with my mom (45 F). We tend to clash over various things, but this particular incident has really driven a wedge between us. The fight happened about four months ago, and it's still affecting our relationship.

A bit of context: I'm very particular about my personal space and privacy. I live in a small apartment, and my mom tends to drop by unannounced quite frequently. I've asked her multiple times to call or text before coming over, but she often ignores this request. This has always been a point of contention between us.

Four months ago, I was having a terrible week. Work was stressful, my boyfriend and I had just had a huge argument, and I was feeling incredibly overwhelmed. I desperately needed some time alone to decompress. My mom, of course, decided to drop by without warning. I was in no mood to entertain anyone, let alone deal with her tendency to get overly involved in my personal life.

When she walked in, I snapped. I told her she had no respect for my boundaries and that I needed her to leave immediately. My tone was harsh, and I could see the hurt in her eyes, but I didn't care at that moment. She left without saying much, and I thought that was the end of it.

Since that day, I've been cold and distant towards her. I didn't reach out, and I avoided her calls and messages. When we did speak, I was curt and uninterested. My mom tried to apologize several times, but I brushed her off each time, convinced that she needed to learn a lesson about respecting my boundaries.

Friends and family have weighed in on the situation. My best friend thinks I'm being too harsh, and my aunt said I should let it go because ""life is too short for grudges."" Even my boyfriend, who has had his own issues with his parents, thinks I'm overreacting. My mom, on the other hand, has stopped trying to reach out as much, probably sensing my frosty attitude.

The current outcome is that our relationship is more strained than ever. Family gatherings are awkward, and there's a palpable tension whenever we're in the same room. My siblings have noticed and have started to take sides, making things even more complicated.

I can't shake the feeling that I'm in the right for wanting my personal space respected, but I'm starting to wonder if I've taken it too far by holding onto this grudge for so long. Am I the asshole for holding a months-long grudge and being cold to my mom after that fight?","I've been having a long-standing relationship with my mom that's been strained lately. We have a tendency to disagree on almost everything, but I've always tried to maintain a somewhat healthy relationship with her.

However, about a month ago, we got into a huge argument over something trivial. I had invited my friends over for dinner and I had told my mom that it was just a small gathering. She decided to drop by uninvited and proceeded to lecture me on how I should have invited her and how she's always been there for me. I got defensive and told her that I needed some space and that I wasn't expecting her to drop by.

She took it personally and got angry, saying that I was being selfish and that she only wanted to spend time with me. The argument escalated, and we both ended up saying some hurtful things to each other.

Since then, I've been pretty cold towards her. I've barely spoken to her, and when I do, it's only to exchange pleasantries. My mom has tried to reach out to me multiple times, but I've ignored her calls and messages. I've told my friends and family that I need some time to myself, but deep down, I think I'm just being petty.

My mom is starting to worry about me, and my friends are telling me that I'm being unfair and that I should make amends. But I feel like she's the one who hurt me and that I deserve some space. I've been replaying the argument in my head, and I still feel angry and hurt.

I know it's been a month, but I just can't seem to forgive her yet. I'm starting to wonder if I'm being unreasonable and if I should just let go of my anger. But at the same time, I feel like she needs to apologize and acknowledge her part in the argument.

A little background: my stepmother married into a new family a few years ago, which included my ex-stepbrother, Jake (28). Things didn’t end well between us when my parents divorced, and I really distanced myself from the whole situation. Despite the awkwardness, I tried to keep things civil when we did run into each other, but we never really had a relationship.

Last weekend, I found out through a mutual friend that Jake was throwing a party to celebrate his recent promotion, and he had invited a bunch of people, including some from our shared past. I wasn’t invited, but honestly, I couldn't help feeling a little miffed. I decided to go, not to reconnect but to make a point and just be confrontational. I had a grudge against Jake and wanted to let loose a bit at his expense.

So, I showed up uninvited, and when I walked into the party, I spotted one of his friends, who had previously bullied me in high school. That was it; I couldn’t hold back. I started yelling at this guy, calling him out for his past behavior and basically ruining the vibe of the party. Everyone turned to stare, and it was super awkward. Jake tried to intervene, but I was too fired up to listen.

To say the least, the party ended on a sour note. People were uncomfortable, and I ended up leaving after making a scene. The fallout has been a mess. Some friends texted me saying I crossed a line, while others thought I was justified for standing up for myself. Jake called me afterward, furious, and said I made a fool of myself and embarrassed him in front of his guests, which I’ll admit did hit me hard. 

Looking back, I realize that my anger got the best of me, and I could have handled the situation differently. Was I really justified in my actions, or did I just make myself look bad? AITA for showing up uninvited to my ex-stepbrother's party and yelling at his guest?","Okay, so here's the backstory. I used to have a stepbrother, Tom (28), but our parents divorced last year, and since then, we haven't really kept in touch. Despite the divorce, I still consider him family, and I recently found out he was having a big party to celebrate his promotion at work. I wasn't invited, which kinda stung, but I figured it was just an oversight.

I decided to show up anyway because, hey, family is family, right? I thought it would be a nice surprise. When I got there, it was clear Tom was not expecting me. He looked a bit uncomfortable but tried to be polite. I mingled for a while, but then I saw a guest, Mark, who had a history with me. He was friends with my ex and had been a major instigator in spreading rumors about our breakup.

Seeing Mark and knowing what he did infuriated me. I lost my temper and confronted him, yelling about all the things he'd done to ruin my previous relationship. The whole party came to a standstill, and Tom intervened, asking me to leave. I was fuming and felt completely justified in calling Mark out for his actions.

Afterwards, I got several angry messages from Tom and some of his friends, accusing me of ruining the party and causing a scene. Tom said I was out of line for showing up uninvited and making a public spectacle. He even mentioned that Mark had apologized for his past behavior and they were trying to move on.

My close friends are divided on this. Some say I was right to stand up for myself, while others think I should've let it go and not crashed the party in the first place. I'm still upset about what happened, but I'm starting to wonder if I was really in the wrong here.

So, AITA for showing up uninvited to my ex-stepbrother's party and yelling at his guest?","I (28F) grew up with my mom and her partner, Mike. We all lived together until I was 16. Mike had a son from a previous marriage, Alex (29M), who was my ex-stepbrother. We weren't super close but I considered him family.

After I left home, I lost contact with Alex for a while, but we eventually reconnected on social media. A few months ago, I saw that Alex was getting married and I decided to reach out to wish him well. I sent him a congratulations message and even offered to help with the wedding in any way I could.

Fast forward to last weekend, I saw on social media that Alex was having a party to celebrate his 30th birthday. I assumed it was an open event since I had seen a ton of people posting about it, so I decided to show up uninvited. I figured it would be a good chance to catch up with Alex and some of the people I used to know.

When I arrived, I saw Alex with a bunch of people I didn't know. He looked a bit stressed, so I went over to him and gave him a hug. We chatted for a bit, and I met some of his friends. However, one of the guests caught my eye. It was my ex-stepbrother's new wife's sister, Rachel (25F), who had a history of flirting with me when I was younger. She and I had a pretty intense conversation a few years ago that ended with her saying she had feelings for me.

I was still processing seeing Rachel when I overheard her making a comment about Alex's wife, implying that she was boring and not fun to be around. I felt a surge of anger and decided to confront Rachel about her comment. I told her that she needed to respect Alex's wife and not speak negatively about her behind her back. Rachel got defensive and we started arguing.

Alex intervened and asked me to leave. I was still upset, so I yelled at Rachel, telling her that she was a toxic person and that she needed to be more considerate of others. I stormed out of the party, feeling pretty vindicated.

When I got home, I saw that Alex had posted about the incident on social media, saying that I had caused a scene and was being rude to his guest. My friends and family are all saying that I was in the wrong, but I feel like I was standing up for Alex's wife. Am I the asshole for yelling at Rachel and causing a scene at my ex-stepbrother's party?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Okay, so here's the backstory. I used to have a stepbrother, Tom (28), but our parents divorced last year, and since then, we haven't really kept in touch. Despite the divorce, I still consider him family, and I recently found out he was having a big party to celebrate his promotion at work. I wasn't invited, which kinda stung, but I figured it was just an oversight.\n\nI decided to show up anyway because, hey, family is family, right? I thought it would be a nice surprise. When I got there, it was clear Tom was not expecting me. He looked a bit uncomfortable but tried to be polite. I mingled for a while, but then I saw a guest, Mark, who had a history with me. He was friends with my ex and had been a major instigator in spreading rumors about our breakup.\n\nSeeing Mark and knowing what he did infuriated me. I lost my temper and confronted him, yelling about all the things he'd done to ruin my previous relationship. The whole party came to a standstill, and Tom intervened, asking me to leave. I was fuming and felt completely justified in calling Mark out for his actions.\n\nAfterwards, I got several angry messages from Tom and some of his friends, accusing me of ruining the party and causing a scene. Tom said I was out of line for showing up uninvited and making a public spectacle. He even mentioned that Mark had apologized for his past behavior and they were trying to move on.\n\nMy close friends are divided on this. Some say I was right to stand up for myself, while others think I should've let it go and not crashed the party in the first place. I'm still upset about what happened, but I'm starting to wonder if I was really in the wrong here.\n\nSo, AITA for showing up uninvited to my ex-stepbrother's party and yelling at his guest?""}]","{

52,AITA for wanting my stepdads brother to stop hanging around the house?,"My mom and I (19f) have been moving from house to house for about 5-6 years since she divorced my dad. About 4 years ago she met my now stepdad (Dave fake name) and about 2 years ago we moved in with him at his house. Dave has a brother (fake name will be John) that has been helping with projects around the house for the past 3-4 months. First it was remolding the master bath, then redoing the floors in some rooms. He fixed my leaky faucet which was amazing. It’s nice to have things fixed around the house. However this is where my mom and I start to have problems. John is still doing more projects. We thought he would be gone by now. He usually gets there at around 7-8 in the morning and stays until 5-6 working on things. So he does not stay over night, but my mom gets annoyed when he tries to insert himself into my mom and stepdads  relaxing time at the end of the day. Dave has no problems with John being there. It’s his house so he can have whoever he wants over. My mom just wants to have privacy which I agree with. I’m tired of having him sit around all the time (which he has started to do.) My mom is getting annoyed with him. We are thankful for all the help John has given us but I feel as though he needs to respect that my mom doesn’t want him over every day. It gets annoying when I wake up to drilling and hammering in the morning but by noon he just sits around and sometimes does some work. Dave gets mad anytime we say something about it. I’m not allowed to speak of it at all. My mom and I are just tired of having John over almost every day of the week. What was my final straw was a couple days ago, my mom has never had a night to herself in 2-3 years. She constantly takes care of Dave who has back problems. This was the night she was happy about. It was around 7 in the afternoon when my mom texted me that John came over and just started sitting around on his IPad doing things. I told her that she needed to tell him to get out. He has no business being there. He didn’t leave until an hour passed I think. I was pissed but I can’t do anything. It’s Dave’s house technically, but it’s like my mom doesn’t even live there to him, it’s like she has no say so in her own privacy. I feel like the a-hole because it’s his house and family, but does he not respect that my mom and I want privacy?   So AITA for wanting my stepdad‘s brother to stop working on projects around the house and give us some privacy?  Edit: thank you to all who have replied so fast. I wanted to clarify some things. I do plan to move out soon I am trying to work to save money. My mom has expressed she doesn’t like him being around all the time. She has tried to tell Dave many times. John has helped with all the important things already, he is doing stuff like building things outside that we didn’t need now. He is at the house almost every day and most days he isn’t doing anything. My mom also pays for a least half of the bills and expenses is what she told me. She also buys all the groceries and does the cleaning.

About 4 years ago she met my now stepdad (Dave fake name) and about 2 years ago we moved in with him at his house. Dave has a brother (fake name will be John) that has been helping with projects around the house for the past 3-4 months. First it was remolding the master bath, then redoing the floors in some rooms. He fixed my leaky faucet which was amazing. It’s nice to have things fixed around the house. However this is where my mom and I start to have problems. John is still doing more projects. We thought he would be gone by now. He usually gets there at around 7-8 in the morning and stays until 5-6 working on things. So he does not stay over night, but my mom gets annoyed when he tries to insert himself into my mom and stepdads  relaxing time at the end of the day. Dave has no problems with John being there. It’s his house so he can have whoever he wants over. My mom just wants to have privacy which I agree with. I’m tired of having him sit around all the time (which he has started to do.) My mom is getting annoyed with him. We are thankful for all the help John has given us but I feel as though he needs to respect that my mom doesn’t want him over every day. It gets annoying when I wake up to drilling and hammering in the morning but by noon he just sits around and sometimes does some work. Dave gets mad anytime we say something about it. I’m not allowed to speak of it at all. My mom and I are just tired of having John over almost every day of the week. What was my final straw was a couple days ago, my mom has never had a night to herself in 2-3 years. She constantly takes care of Dave who has back problems. This was the night she was happy about. It was around 7 in the afternoon when my mom texted me that John came over and just started sitting around on his IPad doing things. I told her that she needed to tell him to get out. He has no business being there. He didn’t leave until an hour passed I think. I was pissed but I can’t do anything. It’s Dave’s house technically, but it’s like my mom doesn’t even live there to him, it’s like she has no say so in her own privacy. I feel like the a-hole because it’s his house and family, but does he not respect that my mom and I want privacy?   So AITA for wanting my stepdad‘s brother to stop working on projects around the house and give us some privacy?  Edit: thank you to all who have replied so fast. I wanted to clarify some things. I do plan to move out soon I am trying to work to save money. My mom has expressed she doesn’t like him being around all the time. She has tried to tell Dave many times. John has helped with all the important things already, he is doing stuff like building things outside that we didn’t need now. He is at the house almost every day and most days he isn’t doing anything. My mom also pays for a least half of the bills and expenses is what she told me. She also buys all the groceries and does the cleaning.

I love my family, but I've also been working hard to create a comfortable living space for myself in our home. My stepdad has a brother (let’s call him Mark) who comes over frequently, sometimes unannounced. I’ve always found Mark a bit overbearing and invasive, but it's never been a huge issue—just mildly irritating.

The situation escalated recently when Mark began to disregard my boundaries entirely. For instance, he would let himself into my space without knocking, help himself to my things without asking, and make comments about my personal life and choices that were really uncomfortable to hear. I had a couple of conversations with my mom and stepdad expressing how I felt, asking them to please talk to Mark about respecting my space and boundaries. They agreed to do so, but it only seemed to make matters worse.

One evening, Mark came over uninvited while I was in the middle of a personal video call. He barged into my room without knocking, loudly cracking jokes about my call, which left me feeling exposed and disrespected. I finally snapped and told him that he needed to knock and respect my space, and that it wasn’t his house to treat as he pleased. 

This led to an awkward situation during dinner where my stepdad and mom seemed tense. They both told me that I was being too harsh and that Mark was just trying to be friendly. They think I should lighten up and let it go because ""he means well."" I feel like I stand my ground for my own comfort, but I also don’t want to create tension in the family.

Now, I find myself questioning if I overreacted. I really believe that everyone should respect each other's boundaries in shared spaces, but I worry I may have come off as rude. Am I the asshole for wanting my stepdad's brother to respect our boundaries in our own home?","My husband and I recently moved into our first home together after saving up for years. It's a cozy little place, and we're both really excited to make it our own. My mom remarried a few years ago, and her husband, Tom, has a younger brother, Rick. Rick has always seemed like a nice enough guy, but he's a bit of a free spirit and tends to be a bit of a nomad, bouncing between different relatives’ homes.

About two weeks ago, Tom asked if Rick could stay with us for a little while because he was between jobs and needed a place to crash. We agreed, thinking it would only be for a short period. Initially, everything was fine, but then things started to go downhill.

Rick has a habit of leaving dirty dishes everywhere, tracking mud into the house, and he never seems to clean up after himself. He also has this annoying tendency to play his music loudly at all hours of the night, which makes it difficult for us to sleep. We've tried talking to him about it, but he just nods and says he’ll do better, then goes right back to his old ways.

The last straw was when he invited a couple of his friends over without asking us first. They were loud, stayed late, and left a mess for us to clean up the next morning. I was furious and told Rick he needed to start respecting our boundaries if he wanted to continue staying with us. He brushed it off, saying we were being too uptight.

I talked to my mom about it, and she thinks I'm overreacting and that I should cut Rick some slack since he's going through a tough time. Tom agreed with my mom, suggesting that Rick just needs more time to adjust. My husband, on the other hand, is on my side and feels that Rick has overstayed his welcome and needs to either shape up or ship out.

I confronted Rick again, and this time I was firmer, telling him he had one week to either start respecting our home or find somewhere else to stay. Rick got upset and told my mom what I said. Now, my mom and Tom are upset with me, saying I’m being heartless and not giving Rick enough support.

While I feel bad because I don't want to cause family drama, I also feel like our home should be a place where we feel comfortable and respected. So, AITA for wanting my stepdad’s brother to respect our boundaries in our own home?","Throw away for privacy. Fake names.

I (32 F) have been married to my husband (35 M) for about 5 years. We have a beautiful 3-year-old daughter together. My husband has a brother named Mark (38 M), who has been a part of our lives since I married my husband. We all get along, but Mark is known for being a bit of a loudmouth and can be very intrusive. He always shows up unannounced and often stays for weeks at a time, claiming he needs to 'help out' with my daughter. My husband and I have made it clear to Mark that we appreciate his help but we also value our alone time and would like some space when he visits. We've asked him multiple times to give us a heads up before showing up and also asked him to respect our boundaries by not dropping by unannounced. However, Mark continues to disregard our wishes and shows up at all hours of the day and night.

The most recent incident happened last weekend when Mark decided to just drop by our house on a whim. He arrived unannounced and started making himself at home, claiming he was 'just going to hang out for a bit'. My husband was working from home and was on a conference call, so he asked Mark to keep it down. Mark continued to make a lot of noise, even after being asked multiple times to be quiet. When I asked him to leave, he got defensive and started yelling at me, saying I was being 'rude' and that he was just trying to spend time with my daughter. He even went so far as to say that my husband and I were 'not welcoming' and that he was 'disappointed' in us. My husband tried to intervene and calm him down, but Mark continued to argue and eventually stormed out of the house.

After he left, my husband and I were both feeling frazzled and frustrated. We felt like Mark had disrespected our boundaries and had made us feel like we were being unreasonable for asking him to respect our space. My husband's mother (Mark's sister) even called me later that day and scolded me for being 'too sensitive' and for not being more 'flexible'. She said that Mark was just trying to be helpful and that I should be grateful for his company. I feel like my boundaries are being disrespected and that no one is taking me seriously.

53,AITA for buying new shoes instead of new laces?,"I (F22) have recently had my dog chew most of the way through the laces on my current set of shoes.

She’s traditionally very frugal and has a strong opinion about money, often talking about how I should be saving and not wasting. Recently, I bought a pair of shoes for £13. They were meant to be a casual option for running errands and hanging out with friends. 

A few days after I got them, I noticed that they were already falling apart. The sole had started to come off, and every step I took made a weird squeaking noise as if they were having a breakdown. I didn’t want to keep wearing them, so I decided to throw them away to avoid the embarrassment of wearing shoes that looked like they belonged in the trash.

When my mom found out, she blew up at me. She yelled about how I wasted money and should have kept the shoes until I could find a way to fix them. I got really frustrated, and in the heat of the moment, I told her that £13 wasn’t worth keeping shoes that were clearly defective. I added that I wouldn’t be ashamed to throw away something that wasn’t serving me anymore.

Her yelling continued, insisting that I was wasteful and should have at least tried to fix them. In my defense, I said that I didn’t want to waste my time or money on something that was clearly not worth it. It became a huge argument, and she eventually stormed off, still muttering about my wastefulness.

Some friends think I was in the right because the shoes were worthless, but others say I could have handled my mom’s reaction better, especially since she was upset about money. I’ve never been great at dealing with her when she gets in one of her moods, but I really did feel justified in my actions. 

So, AITA for throwing away the £13 shoes and then standing up for myself when my mom yelled at me?","I (16F) recently had a major fallout with my mum over a pair of shoes, and I need some perspective on whether I'm truly in the wrong here. So here's the full story.

For context, money has always been tight in our household. My mum works incredibly hard to make ends meet, and we don't have the luxury of splurging on non-essential items. Recently, I saved up some pocket money and bought myself a pair of shoes for £13. They weren't anything fancy, just a pair of trendy sneakers that I liked and could wear to school.

About two weeks after I got them, I noticed they were already falling apart. The soles had started to come off, and the fabric was tearing. I was really disappointed because £13 is a lot of money for me, and I expected them to last longer. Frustrated, I decided to just throw them away. I didn't see the point in keeping shoes that were practically unusable.

When my mum found out, she went ballistic. She started yelling at me, saying how wasteful I was and that I should have at least tried to fix them or repurpose them in some way. I tried to explain that they were beyond repair and that I didn't want to keep something that was falling apart, but she was having none of it. She accused me of being irresponsible with money and not appreciating the value of things.

In my defense, I pointed out that I had saved up my own money to buy the shoes and that it was my decision to get rid of them. I also mentioned that sometimes cheap shoes just don't last, and it's not always something you can fix. This only made her angrier, and she said I was being disrespectful and defiant.

The argument escalated to the point where we were both shouting at each other. My mum ended up grounding me for a week, saying I needed to learn a lesson about value and respect. Now, I'm feeling a mix of guilt and frustration. On one hand, I understand that money is tight and I should be more careful with my purchases. On the other hand, I feel like I had the right to throw away something that was no longer usable, especially since it was my own money.

So, AITA for throwing away the £13 shoes and defending myself against my mum's yelling?","throwawaymumisntcool.

I (29f) live with my mum, who is quite overbearing and controlling. She's always on my case about something. I've learned to just roll my eyes and let it go. She's been on my case about getting a 'proper job' and 'wasting my life' on my part-time job and volunteering.

I was at the charity shop with my mum, and she started going on about how I should buy something nice for myself, just for once. She picked out a £13 pair of shoes that I didn't like, but she insisted I needed them. I politely told her that I didn't want to spend that much money on shoes I wouldn't wear. She started yelling at me that I was being'so selfish' and that she was 'only trying to help.' 

I had had enough and threw the shoes in the bin. My mum freaked out, saying I was 'wasting £13' and that I was 'ruining her chances of getting a nice pair of shoes for herself.' She started yelling at me some more, saying I was 'heartless' and 'had no gratitude.'

I stood up for myself and told her that she was being unreasonable and that I wasn't going to spend money on something I didn't want. She just got angrier and started calling me names. I told her to calm down and left the shop.

I know I shouldn't have thrown away the shoes, but I was fed up with her constant nagging and yelling. I just wanted some peace and quiet.

He’s a great guy, but he has this habit of wearing his neon safety vest everywhere. He works in construction, so I get that he wears it on the job, but outside of work? It’s like he thinks it’s acceptable to throw it on for a casual outing. We live in a small town, so I understand the vest sometimes blends into his environment, but it’s still a neon yellow, and I can’t help but feel it looks ridiculous.

The other day, we had planned a nice dinner out with some friends. I was really looking forward to it, and I dressed up in a cute outfit. When he showed up wearing that damn neon vest over his nice shirt, I couldn’t help but cringe. I love this guy, but I also want him to look presentable when we're out in public. I jokingly told him he looked like a crossing guard and that he should consider swapping it for a nice jacket. He laughed it off at first, but when I continued to poke fun at it (I may have gone a little overboard), he seemed to take it to heart. 

My friends were split. Some thought I was being too harsh and that it was just his way of dressing comfortably, while others agreed with me that he should be more mindful of how he presents himself, especially when we’re out. After our dinner, he seemed a bit distant and mentioned he doesn’t think my comments about his vest are funny anymore.

The thing is, I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. I just thought that we could be that couple that looks good together, you know? Now I’m questioning if I should’ve just let it go and accepted that he likes his vest. I also feel bad because I feel like I made a big deal over something that doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things.

So, am I the asshole for making a big deal out of my boyfriend’s neon safety vest?","I've been dating my boyfriend, Matt, for about a year now. Matt is a construction worker, and his job requires him to wear a neon safety vest. The vest itself isn't the problem; it's that he often forgets to take it off when we go out right after work. He'll wear it to dinner, to the movies, even when we're running errands. I understand he's probably tired after work, but it's embarrassing to be seen with him looking like he just came from a construction site all the time.

The other night, we had plans to meet some friends for dinner. Matt showed up in his neon vest again. I pulled him aside and asked him politely if he could leave it in the car. His response was that it's just easier to keep it on in case he needs to head back to work for any reason. I couldn't help but feel like he wasn't considering how I felt about it, and I told him so. We had a bit of an argument, and eventually, he agreed to take it off, but not without making a comment about how silly I was being.

Our friends noticed the tension and asked what had happened. When I explained, they seemed split. Some agreed with Matt, saying it wasn't a big deal, while others said they understood why I'd be bothered. Since then, Matt has been somewhat distant and keeps bringing up the vest in a joking manner, clearly still annoyed by the whole incident.

I talked to my sister about it, and she thinks I was being too uptight and that it's just a vest—it shouldn't matter. On the other hand, I feel like it's a respect thing. If he cared about my feelings, he would take it off without making a fuss. 

So now I'm wondering, AITA for making a big deal out of my boyfriend's neon safety vest?","I've been dating my boyfriend for a year now and things have been going great. However, our friends and I have a tradition of getting together for a weekly game night. The host always asks us to contribute a small dish to share and a drink to bring. We all try to outdo each other with the most creative and delicious dishes.

Last week, my boyfriend was asked to bring a dish, and he told me he was making his famous chicken parmesan. I was excited to try it and thought it would be a hit. However, when he showed up at game night wearing a neon safety vest, I was mortified. He told me it was a ""fashion statement"" and that he wanted to add a pop of color to the evening.

I couldn't help but laugh and tease him about it, but deep down, I was embarrassed. I didn't want our friends to think I was dating someone who was that awkward or attention-seeking. So, I asked him to take it off, but he refused, saying that it was a ""part of the experience.""

As the night went on, I found myself making a big deal about the vest, joking that it was a "" warning sign"" for his cooking and that it was a "" beacon of hope"" that the food would be bad. Our friends started to pick up on my teasing and started making jokes about it too. The atmosphere at the party started to become awkward, and my boyfriend began to feel self-conscious.

To make matters worse, our friends started to make snide comments about my boyfriend's fashion sense, and I couldn't help but contribute to it. By the end of the night, my boyfriend was visibly upset, and we had a huge fight on the way home.

When I asked him why he wore the vest, he told me that he was trying to be confident and stand out, but I ended up making him feel like a joke. He said that he felt like I was embarrassed to be seen with him and that I was trying to make him look foolish in front of our friends.

I know I overreacted, but I was worried about what our friends would think of him. Now, I'm not sure if I was the asshole for making a big deal out of the vest, or if my boyfriend should have just taken it off when I asked him to.

Matt is a construction worker, and his job requires him to wear a neon safety vest. The vest itself isn't the problem; it's that he often forgets to take it off when we go out right after work. He'll wear it to dinner, to the movies, even when we're running errands. I understand he's probably tired after work, but it's embarrassing to be seen with him looking like he just came from a construction site all the time.\n\nThe other night, we had plans to meet some friends for dinner. Matt showed up in his neon vest again. I pulled him aside and asked him politely if he could leave it in the car. His response was that it's just easier to keep it on in case he needs to head back to work for any reason. I couldn't help but feel like he wasn't considering how I felt about it, and I told him so. We had a bit of an argument, and eventually, he agreed to take it off, but not without making a comment about how silly I was being.\n\nOur friends noticed the tension and asked what had happened. When I explained, they seemed split. Some agreed with Matt, saying it wasn't a big deal, while others said they understood why I'd be bothered. Since then, Matt has been somewhat distant and keeps bringing up the vest in a joking manner, clearly still annoyed by the whole incident.\n\nI talked to my sister about it, and she thinks I was being too uptight and that it's just a vest—it shouldn't matter. On the other hand, I feel like it's a respect thing. If he cared about my feelings, he would take it off without making a fuss. \n\nSo now I'm wondering, AITA for making a big deal out of my boyfriend's neon safety vest?""}]","{

55,AITA For asking my mom to babysit my son?,"I 22F have a one and a half year old son, i rarely ever ask anyone to babysit him but the times i have it’s never been more than an hour. Recently I’ve been wanting to dye my hair but want it professionally done which I’ve never done, so it comes out the way i want it. i also have been wanting a hair at a salon, i usually cut my own and haven’t been to a salon for a hair cut since middle school. All of this is a little pricey to me and i view as a huge luxury. I was looking up salons around me and appointment times and the only one that seem to work out for me was on Friday which happens to be my birthday. I went back and forth on this for an hour and finally convinced myself that i deserve this. Before i made the appointment i doubled checked with my mom to see if she can watch my son while i go which would be about 3 hours. She response was very unexpected. She reminded me there’s a possibility that her work could call her for over time(she works M-F for three hours a day) and she wasn’t gonna decline for me. Then she remembered she has that Thursday and Friday off giving her a for day weekend, but she looked at me real serious and started saying it was her day off and kept repeating that to me. She then said i need to be scheduling that kind of stuff for the weekend. The salon i was gonna book at has no weekend openings till mid December and i wanted it for my birthday. When i told her that she just looked at me and again said it was her day off and i need to schedule stuff like this for the weekend. She just treated me like i was being totally inconsiderate and like i do this often but i don’t especially not her but i did this time because she’s my only option. I feel extremely bummed because i never get pampered, i don’t get my nails done or get pedicures or anything like plus I’ve had a hell of a past 16 months.

When i told her that she just looked at me and again said it was her day off and i need to schedule stuff like this for the weekend. She just treated me like i was being totally inconsiderate and like i do this often but i don’t especially not her but i did this time because she’s my only option. I feel extremely bummed because i never get pampered, i don’t get my nails done or get pedicures or anything like plus I’ve had a hell of a past 16 months.

With a busy life as a working mom of a 1.5-year-old, I don’t often get the chance to pamper myself. So, I scheduled a long-overdue hair appointment for the morning of my birthday, thinking it would be the perfect way to start the day.

I reached out to my mom, who lives nearby, to ask if she could watch my little one for a couple of hours while I got my hair done. I figured it would be a great opportunity for her to spend some quality time with her grandchild as well. However, my mom hesitated and expressed that it might be too much for her, even for just a couple of hours. She mentioned that she had her own plans for the day, which I completely understood.

In the end, I decided to go ahead with the appointment and lined up a babysitter instead. My mom then seemed a bit offended that I didn’t wait for her to give me a definite answer before making other arrangements. She pointed out that it was my birthday and that she would have loved to help, but I just wasn’t sure how much time I could wait since the appointment slots fill up quickly and I wanted to treat myself.

Now, my mom and some close friends have mixed feelings about the situation. Some think I should have waited for her response out of respect, while others believe I was right to prioritize my self-care and the appointment since it could be rescheduled at a later date. The tension has led to some awkward conversations, and I don’t want this to affect our relationship.

I genuinely wanted my mom to be involved, but I also needed to take care of myself. So, am I the asshole for asking my mom to babysit on my birthday for a hair appointment?","Hey everyone, I (28F) have a bit of a dilemma and need an outside perspective. My birthday is coming up next week, and as a little treat for myself, I booked a hair appointment at my favorite salon. It’s a bit of a splurge, but I’ve been feeling the need for some self-care. The appointment is for a couple of hours, and it’s really the only “me time” I get.

For context, I have a 1.5-year-old son who is an absolute joy but, as any parent knows, he’s a handful. My mom (54F) is usually very helpful with babysitting, but she has her own things going on and isn’t always available on short notice. I asked her a few days ago if she could watch my son for a couple of hours on my birthday so I could go to this hair appointment. She seemed hesitant because she’s had a busy week and mentioned she might want to relax that day. I could tell she felt guilty even considering saying no, which made me feel horrible for asking in the first place.

From her perspective, she’s already done so much for me and my son, and I totally get why she might want a break. On the other hand, it’s my birthday, and this appointment means a lot to me. I don’t have many other options for babysitters, and I don’t want to seem ungrateful or imposing.

To complicate things, my friends and family are divided on this issue. Some of them think it’s totally reasonable for me to ask her to babysit for a couple of hours on my birthday. Others think I might be expecting too much, given that she has her own life and deserves her downtime. My husband can’t take the day off work, so he’s not available to help either.

Now I’m stuck in this weird limbo where I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable. I don’t want to make my mom feel pressured, but I also don’t want to cancel my plans if I don’t have to. 

So, AITA for asking my mom to watch my 1.5-year-old on my birthday for a hair appointment?","So, my mom has been super helpful over the past year with watching my 1.5-year-old daughter while I go out with friends or run errands. We've been in this co-parenting arrangement for a while now, where my partner and I take turns watching each other's kids so we can have some me time. My birthday is coming up and I've been looking forward to getting my hair done. I've been wanting to go to this high-end salon downtown for months, and I finally have the time to schedule it. Problem is, my partner is working on my birthday and can't watch the kid. So, I text my mom asking if she can watch my daughter for a few hours while I get my hair done. Now, I know it's my birthday, but I also know my mom has been busy with work and hasn't had much free time lately. She agrees to watch the kid, but I can tell she's not thrilled about it. I don't get why - I'm asking her for help on my special day, and I'm giving her plenty of notice. Fast forward to the day of my appointment, and my mom is actually pretty nice about it, but I can tell she's still a bit miffed. My partner and I end up having a conversation about it, and they mention that maybe I should be more considerate of my mom's feelings and not expect her to always drop everything for me. I guess what I'm saying is, I feel like I'm being a good mom by asking for help, but my partner thinks I should be more considerate of my mom's schedule.

We (f26), me and my boyfriend (m23) have recently moved into a nice home located on a riverside. We have no neighbors in front of us, only to the side and behind. Our neighbors to our right live in a Triplex, three families one roof. A few weeks ago, one of the neighbors friend started to park in front of our house. We didn\'t know it was them until my BF, who knows one of the girls living in the triplex, asked them if they knew who this unknown large black truck belonged to. I didn\'t think much of it until the car was parked there every day after. The BF asked them to move their vehicle upon my request. It was becoming an eyesore, and frankly I find it rude that they\'re parking in front of our home in the first place. \n\nThey moved the large truck, to only be replaced a few days later by two sedans now taking up the entirety of our front. One is even blocking our mailbox now. My BF said due to property easement, I can\'t even legally make them move. He originally (back with the black truck) told them that they can park in front of our recycling bin off to the side of our property. They would basically be parked half on our side half on theirs under one of the electrical posts. They moved our recycling bin forward, now near the post, and are parking behind it right in front of our doorway with the other behind.\n\nAt this point I\'m getting mad, and I\'ve even thought about saying, ""fuck it"" and going out to buy a bunch of bushes and plants and planting them on the property line so they can\'t park there anymore. My BF has already asked them not to park there, but he said that if they\'re choosing to ignore him it\'s out of his hands. He also doesn\'t understand why I\'m getting so worked up about it, says I\'m being dumb. My biggest issues are 1) I find it incredibly rude to park in front of someone\'s property & 2) I didn\'t buy a riverside property to stare at my neighbors cars all day.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I were to actively try and prevent my neighbors from parking in front of my home, despite the whole ""property easement law""?\n\nIf it makes a difference, I live in Virginia.

I've always been the type of student who tries really hard but struggles with certain subjects, especially math and science. I put in hours of studying, but my grades just never seem to reflect the effort I put in. My mom (f45) has always been very academic-oriented and puts a lot of pressure on me to excel. She's a straight-A student herself, and while I admire her work ethic, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by her expectations.

Last week, I had a particularly stressful night studying for a math exam. I was feeling lost and anxious, and despite trying to focus, I just couldn't get it. The next day, I failed the test. When I came home, my mom was upset and immediately started lecturing me about how I need to apply myself more and how I’m wasting my potential. I completely understand that she means well, but in that moment, I felt overwhelmed and defeated. I snapped and yelled at her, telling her that I already feel awful and that her comments weren't helping at all.

After I yelled, she got really hurt and said that I was being disrespectful. I immediately regretted how I reacted because that wasn’t my intention; I just felt like I was being attacked when I was already down. I tried to apologize later, but I could tell she was still upset.

Friends of mine think my mom is being a bit harsh and that it’s understandable to get frustrated when you’re under so much pressure. Others say that I crossed a line by yelling at her and should have communicated my feelings more calmly. My mom, however, insists that I need to learn to take responsibility for my actions and that I shouldn't have reacted that way. 

Looking back, I see both sides of the argument. I don't want to blame her for caring about my education, but I also don't want to feel like a failure for struggling. Am I the asshole for yelling at my mom when she got mad at me for struggling in school?","I (17F) have been struggling in school for the past few months. I've been dealing with a lot of stress from extracurricular activities, college applications, and trying to keep up with my part-time job. My grades have been slipping, and I've been overwhelmed trying to balance everything. 

My mom (45F) is a very high-achieving person. She always excelled in her career and had high expectations for me. She would often tell me about how she managed to get straight A's while working two jobs and still having a social life. She believes that if she could do it, I should be able to as well.

Last week, I got back a math test that I didn’t do well on. I knew it wasn't my best work, but I genuinely tried my hardest given the circumstances. When I showed my mom, she was livid. She started yelling at me, asking why I wasn't doing better and accusing me of not trying hard enough. Feeling cornered and frustrated, I tried to explain how stressed I was and how hard I was working just to keep my head above water. 

But she kept pushing, telling me that I was making excuses and that I needed to get my act together. In the heat of the moment, I snapped and yelled back at her, telling her she had no idea how hard things were for me and that she wasn't helping by putting more pressure on me. She looked shocked and hurt, and without another word, she walked away and hasn’t spoken much to me since.

My younger sister (14F) overheard the fight and told me later that she understood where I was coming from and that Mom can be really tough sometimes. On the other hand, my dad (46M) thinks I was completely out of line for yelling at her and that I should apologize immediately. Some of my friends think that I stood up for myself and that my mom needed a reality check, but others say that yelling at your parents is never okay, regardless of the situation.

Now there's this tense atmosphere at home, and I don’t know how to fix it. I'm starting to feel guilty about the way I reacted, but I also feel like my mom wasn't listening to me at all.

Am I the asshole for yelling at my mom when she got mad at me for struggling in school?","Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm a 16-year-old high school student and I've been struggling in school lately. My grades have been slipping, and I've been really stressed out about it. My mom has been on my case about it nonstop, always asking me what I'm going to do to improve, and reminding me that my future depends on my grades.

Last night was a particularly bad night. I had a math test and I didn't do well on it. I came home from school and my mom was already there, waiting for me to tell her how I did. When I told her I didn't do well, she just lost it. She started yelling at me, saying that I'm not trying hard enough, that I'm wasting my potential, and that I'm going to end up failing in life.

I got really defensive and yelled back at her. I told her that I'm trying my best, but it's just not coming easily for me. I told her that she's always on my case, and that it's making me feel like I'm not good enough. We got into a huge argument, and at one point, I yelled at her to ""just calm down and trust me"" because I knew I was doing the best I could.

After we finished arguing, my mom stormed out of the room and wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the night. Now she's not speaking to me and I'm really worried that we're going to be like this for a while.

I know I shouldn't have yelled at my mom, but I feel like she was being really unfair and unreasonable.

For some context, I have a close group of friends, and one of them, let’s call her Sarah, recently got a puppy. The first couple of months were great; she took the puppy out, trained her, and seemed genuinely excited about owning a dog. However, as time went on, I noticed that the excitement faded, and the puppy was left alone for hours on end. Sarah started to cancel plans because she ""couldn’t leave the dog alone,"" but it became clear that she wasn’t really taking care of the little one.

I tried talking to her about it—suggesting she look into doggy daycare options or even hiring a dog walker. She always brushed me off, saying things like, “I’ll get it together soon,” or “It’s just a phase.” Meanwhile, I’d see social media posts of her going out and having fun while the puppy was left in a crate for most of the day. It broke my heart.

One day, I went over to visit, and the puppy was visibly distressed. She was whining and had made a mess in her crate. I couldn’t just stand by and do nothing. After talking to a few other friends who felt the same way, I made the impulsive decision to take the puppy home with me. I thought I could take care of her temporarily until Sarah got her act together.

I texted Sarah to let her know what I’d done, thinking she’d understand that it was for the puppy’s sake. Boy, was I wrong. She exploded in anger, demanding that I bring her back immediately. I tried to explain my reasoning—how the puppy deserves a loving and caring environment, but she wouldn’t hear it. She accused me of stealing her dog and threatened to report me. 

Now, I get why she would be upset, and I understand that I should have asked for her permission. But the situation didn’t feel right to me, and I thought I was acting in the best interest of the puppy. Some of our other friends think I was justified, but the majority say I overstepped and should have left it alone.

So, I’m sitting here wondering: AITA for taking the neglected dog from my friend’s house without their permission?","I (28F) have a group of friends that I’ve known since college, and we often hang out at each other's places. One of my friends, Lisa (27F), has had a dog, Max, for about two years now. Over time, it became clear to me that Lisa wasn’t taking proper care of Max. She would often leave him alone for long hours with little food, fresh water, or attention. When we visited, Max would be visibly stressed, and sometimes aggressive, likely due to the neglect.

On numerous occasions, I tried talking to Lisa about Max’s welfare. I even offered to help walk him or take care of him when she was busy, but she always brushed me off or got defensive, saying she was doing her best and that I should mind my own business. This went on for months, and nothing seemed to change; if anything, Max’s condition appeared to worsen. 

Last weekend, we all gathered at Lisa’s place for a get-together. I arrived early and witnessed Max in an even more distressing state than usual. He looked thinner, his fur was matted, and he seemed dehydrated. I couldn’t bear to see him suffering, so when everyone was distracted, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took Max, put him in my car, and drove him to my house. I left a note for Lisa explaining that I took Max because I was worried about his wellbeing.

When Lisa discovered Max was gone, she was furious. She called me immediately, screaming and demanding that I bring Max back. I tried to explain my concerns, offering to help her find a better solution for Max’s care, but she wasn't having it. Our mutual friends are divided on the issue. Some agree with Lisa, saying it wasn’t my place to take her dog without permission, while others think I did the right thing given the circumstances. Now, Lisa is threatening to call the police on me for stealing her dog, and our friendship group is in turmoil.

Currently, Max is staying with me, and I’ve made an appointment for him at the vet to get checked out. I truly believe I acted in Max’s best interest, but I can’t ignore the fact that I took him without Lisa’s consent, and now there’s a rift in our friendship group. 

So, AITA for taking a neglected dog from my friend's house without their permission?","I've been friends with Mike and Emily for years, and we've always had a pretty good dynamic going. However, over the past year or so, I've noticed that their house has started to fall into disarray, and their neglected dog, Rocky, has become a reflection of that. The backyard is a mess, the dog's food is often stale, and he's consistently dirty and matted.

Last week, I stopped by Mike and Emily's house to grab something, and I was hit with the overwhelming stench of filth and neglect. Rocky was cowering in the corner, clearly afraid of me, and the state of their home was absolutely heartbreaking. I couldn't help but think about the poor animal living in those conditions.

I know it sounds harsh, but I genuinely believe Mike and Emily have failed Rocky. They've got two young kids, and it seems like the dog has become an afterthought in their household. I couldn't shake the feeling that they're not providing for Rocky's basic needs, let alone giving him the love and attention he deserves.

In desperation, I decided to take Rocky out for a walk and try to get him cleaned up. I figured I'd drop him off at the local animal shelter, where he'd at least get the care he needs. But as I was walking him, I realized I wasn't ready to let him go. I took him home with me, figuring I'd give him a temporary reprieve from his miserable life.

Here's the thing: I never told Mike and Emily what I'd done. I know it's wrong to take someone else's pet without their permission, but I genuinely believed I was doing Rocky a favor. Now that the dust has settled, I'm starting to realize the gravity of my actions. I've basically stolen their dog, and I'm not sure how to make it right.

I've tried to reach out to Mike and Emily, but they're not responding to my calls or messages. I'm not sure if they're mad at me or just ignoring me. Part of me is worried that I've ruined our friendship, and the other part of me is still convinced that I did the right thing.

One of my friends, Lisa (27F), has had a dog, Max, for about two years now. Over time, it became clear to me that Lisa wasn’t taking proper care of Max. She would often leave him alone for long hours with little food, fresh water, or attention. When we visited, Max would be visibly stressed, and sometimes aggressive, likely due to the neglect.\n\nOn numerous occasions, I tried talking to Lisa about Max’s welfare. I even offered to help walk him or take care of him when she was busy, but she always brushed me off or got defensive, saying she was doing her best and that I should mind my own business. This went on for months, and nothing seemed to change; if anything, Max’s condition appeared to worsen. \n\nLast weekend, we all gathered at Lisa’s place for a get-together. I arrived early and witnessed Max in an even more distressing state than usual. He looked thinner, his fur was matted, and he seemed dehydrated. I couldn’t bear to see him suffering, so when everyone was distracted, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took Max, put him in my car, and drove him to my house. I left a note for Lisa explaining that I took Max because I was worried about his wellbeing.\n\nWhen Lisa discovered Max was gone, she was furious. She called me immediately, screaming and demanding that I bring Max back. I tried to explain my concerns, offering to help her find a better solution for Max’s care, but she wasn't having it. Our mutual friends are divided on the issue. Some agree with Lisa, saying it wasn’t my place to take her dog without permission, while others think I did the right thing given the circumstances. Now, Lisa is threatening to call the police on me for stealing her dog, and our friendship group is in turmoil.\n\nCurrently, Max is staying with me, and I’ve made an appointment for him at the vet to get checked out. I truly believe I acted in Max’s best interest, but I can’t ignore the fact that I took him without Lisa’s consent, and now there’s a rift in our friendship group. \n\nSo, AITA for taking a neglected dog from my friend's house without their permission?""}]","{

I also know she's content with missing trick or treating bc her son is in daycare and got to go to parties...my child did not...nothing for Halloween..except looking forward to the actual day.  My daughter got better,  but I came down with strep throat. I went to doctor and got antibiotics and im not contagious but not up to par.  I asked her if we could park our car in their driveway to go trick or treating. Im going to wear a mask and push a stroller..not going door to door and my husband and toddler were going to go door to door. Now I didnt ask them to see us, go to their door for treats, nothing but park the car. Her response was ""I am sorry but I am not comfortable with that."" My response was okay. Although I respect she has a right to answer how she feels, I dont understand what's uncomfortable? All I can think is shes thinking im not being responsible and just thinking along the lines of covid protocol...but as I stated before, im on antibiotics, not contagious, confirmed this with the doctor and also don't want to see or hangout with her and her family.

Although I respect she has a right to answer how she feels, I dont understand what\'s uncomfortable? All I can think is shes thinking im not being responsible and just thinking along the lines of covid protocol...but as I stated before, im on antibiotics, not contagious, confirmed this with the doctor and also don\'t want to see or hangout with her and her family.  Her response made me feel like I did some faux pas. I don\'t even want to ask because I feel like its so stupid to deny me of a simple request. AITA for asking her to park my car in her driveway on Halloween. I just need more opinions because its bothering me.'}]","The OP asked her friend if she could park her car in her driveway for an hour on Halloween so she could take her kids trick-or-treating. The friend declined, citing discomfort, but the OP believes it's an unreasonable request given that she's not contagious and is taking precautions.

My manager just so happens to be out of the office for the same week I'm watching the kids. Because of this,I cannot make adjustments to my schedule. The one child has to be at school at 6am (long before the school busses start running) for an advanced band he's in. I cannot reasonably take him to this practice and get to work on time.

With COVID-19 still a concern, we both agreed to celebrate in smaller ways—less crowded events and more individual celebrations in safe spaces. However, Sarah brought up that she was planning to have a few close friends over for a small get-together and a bit of trick-or-treating with her kids.

As we talked, I mentioned that I live in a really busy neighborhood where kids flood in on Halloween, and with social distancing being a priority, I was a little anxious about the crowding at my house. So, I casually asked Sarah if she’d be open to letting me park in her driveway for the evening. The plan was that I’d get to her house early and help out with the kids' festivities, but I wanted to ensure that I had a safe place to park without contributing to the street crowding.

Sarah paused for a moment and then said she’d prefer not to, citing that she wanted to keep her driveway clear for any other guests and didn’t want to add more to the mix of our pandemic concerns. I totally understood her feelings since she has young kids and safety is a top priority for her.

I felt a bit awkward after asking, and I wondered if I had overstepped by making that request. I didn’t want to put her in an uncomfortable position or make her feel like she couldn’t say no. But at the same time, it was frustrating not having a good parking option and I felt a little disappointed about our Halloween plans needing to change because of my parking situation.

I talked to a few mutual friends, and they seemed split. Some felt that asking for the driveway was reasonable, especially given the COVID-19 concerns, while others thought it might have been a bit much to expect someone to accommodate me like that.

In the end, I decided to find alternative parking and will spend Halloween at home with my family instead. I still feel a bit uncertain about whether I should have asked her in the first place. Am I the asshole for asking a friend if I could park in her driveway on Halloween due to COVID-19 concerns?","So, here's the situation. I (29F) am really close friends with my neighbor, Emma (31F). We live in a busy neighborhood that gets flooded with trick-or-treaters every Halloween. It's usually a really fun time, but this year, with COVID-19 still being a concern, things are a bit different for me.

I have a compromised immune system, and my doctor has advised me to limit my exposure as much as possible. Emma's house is two doors down from mine, and she has a driveway, while I have street parking. My problem is that with the hordes of kids and parents expected to be out and about, I'm really anxious about having to walk from my car to my house through all those people.

I asked Emma if it would be okay for me to park in her driveway for the evening. I explained my health concerns and how nervous I am about potentially exposing myself to the virus. Emma was understanding but mentioned that her own parents and brother usually come over for Halloween, and they also park in her driveway. She said she would have to check with them first before giving me an answer.

Emma's family is very tight-knit, and they have their own traditions, which I totally respect. She got back to me a day later and said it wouldn't be possible because they actually need all the parking spaces for her family members. She apologized and said if she could spare a spot, she definitely would.

Our mutual friends have mixed opinions. Some think Emma should have made an exception for me given my health concerns, while others believe it's reasonable for her to prioritize her family's needs, especially since they have their own traditions and plans for the evening.

As for the outcome, I've decided to just stay home on Halloween to avoid any unnecessary exposure. I'm a little disappointed, but I understand Emma's position. We haven't had any fallout or tension over it, and we're still as close as ever. 

So, what do you think? Am I the asshole for asking Emma to let me park in her driveway on Halloween due to my COVID-19 concerns?","So I've known my friend since college and we've always been close. We live in a pretty suburban area and we've become like a second family to each other. Anyway, Halloween is coming up and I'm really excited to take my kids trick-or-treating. The thing is, COVID-19 is still a thing and I'm really nervous about the crowds and potential exposure. My friend has a big house with a big driveway, and I was thinking it would be super convenient to park there while we're out trick-or-treating. So I asked her if it would be okay if I could park in her driveway on Halloween night, and she said no. She mentioned that she'd already invited her friends over for a Halloween party and they'd be using the driveway for parking. I totally get it, I would've done the same thing in her shoes. But then I asked her if she'd be willing to make an exception just this one time, due to my concerns about COVID-19, and she said no again. She mentioned that she's not worried about COVID-19 and that I should just wear a mask and be fine. I told her that I appreciate her concern, but that my kids are really young and I'm just not comfortable taking that risk. She basically told me that I'm being paranoid and that I should just suck it up and park on the street like everyone else. I feel like I'm being reasonable, but at the same time, I don't want to be a bother to my friend.

59,AITA for scrolling far back through my boyfriend’s messages when he allowed me to?,"While my boyfriend of 3 years was replying to someone, I noticed he was replying to a name that I was unfamiliar with. I casually asked and he told me that it was the co-worker that he had been telling me that he made friends with at work. I knew about the coworker though I couldn’t remember him telling me what the name of this co-worker was or that if I even asked.  I jokingly pretended to be suspicious about their relationship and tried to test how he would react if ever I wanted to read their messages. He gladly gave me his phone and opened the messages for me to see.    I felt relieved that he willingly did that so I was just trying to scroll up trying to load up all the messages though I didn’t really have the intention of reading them. I was only curious as to when they started chatting. The more I scrolled, the more I realized that they talked almost everyday, although mostly it’s work-related, I saw memes and banter going on here and there. I didn’t exactly read the messages as I scrolled up but I can see glimpses of what they talked about. I started to feel sad, because I realized on some days when we wouldn’t be talking, they would be and it would be a lot of talking. My insecurity flared up and I started telling him how they talk a lot and all. He then suddenly was mad all of a sudden and was accusing me of having no trust in him. I asked him when they started talking and he said he doesn’t remember. I thought after scrolling a lot that I couldn’t pinpoint when they did because there were just too many messages to load, so I just gave up and gave him his phone. Afterwards, he started acting cold and would not talk to me even when I offered for us to reconcile. AITA for what I did?   A little background as to why I acted the way I did: Me and my boyfriend went through a rough patch a year ago because he admitted to me that he fell in love with his close female friend. Despite this, I forgave him because he came clean to me and he cut her off to save our relationship. He never cheated with her or anything, but it was more like a one-sided crush that turned into something worse on his part. Since then, we established boundaries, especially friendship with female friends on his part as to not blur the lines anymore in terms of friendship.   Also, another side note: I never monitor messages in his phone in secret.

Needless to say, the class is incredibly tough. Luckily though, I have been studying since day 1 so I am doing alright in the class. I am taking the class with a group of friends, so to help them out, I shared the personal notes that I take in class with them via a google doc, and I encouraged them to invite anyone they know. \n\nRecently, one of my friends invited a friend of theirs, let\'s call her Jess(20F), who i\'ve never really interacted with, but I have a massive crush on. I think she and I would make a great couple, but she\'s not really into sensitive smart guys, because on her Instagram, I see all her stories show her out with really jock-like men.\n\nOur third exam is in a couple of days, and as I was going through the google doc, I realized that she was using my doc the most. You can see who looks at or edits the doc on google docs, and most of my other friends would pop up sometimes, but I would see her icon pop up alot. I also know for a fact that she isn\'t doing well in the class, so I got a really good idea. I would put subtle mistakes in the doc so that she wouldn\'t do well in the exam, and then I can offer to tutor her. That way, I can interact with her and talk to her, so that she\'ll realize that I have a great personality, and we can hopefully go out together.\n\nI told my friend about this plan, and they called me an ""incel AH"". Personally, I think they\'re overreacting, because Jess isn\'t going to do well either way, even if I don\'t put mistakes, so my plan will actually benefit her grades, while also allowing me to interact with her and talk to her.

We have a pretty good relationship, but trust has always been a bit of an issue for me. I tend to get anxious about it because of a previous relationship where I was cheated on. I’ve tried to work on my trust issues, but it’s still a struggle.

Recently, I accidentally discovered that my boyfriend’s phone was unlocked when I picked it up to check the time for myself. Curiosity got the better of me, and I found myself scrolling through some of his old messages. I know it was wrong, but it felt like I just had to see if there was anything I needed to be concerned about. 

As I was scrolling, I found some messages from a girl he used to date and a few flirty exchanges from before we got serious, which made me feel uneasy. Instead of just letting it go, I confronted him about it. He was really surprised and upset that I had looked through his phone, and he felt like I was invading his privacy. I asked him if he thought those messages were appropriate, and he assured me that they were from the past and that he was completely invested in our relationship now.

However, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that maybe he wasn’t being truthful about how he felt about that girl. I ended up pressuring him to explain himself further, questioning whether he was still in contact with her or if he had feelings for her at any point. He got frustrated, saying he felt like I didn’t trust him and that this was damaging our relationship.

My friends have mixed opinions about it. Some think I was justified in my curiosity, while others believe I completely crossed a line by invading his privacy. I’m now feeling guilty for making him upset and possibly pushing him away, but I was just trying to protect myself from getting hurt again.

So, AITA for scrolling through my boyfriend’s old messages and questioning his trustworthiness?","I've been dating my boyfriend, Jake (28M), for about a year now. For the most part, our relationship has been great, but I (26F) have always had trust issues stemming from previous relationships where I was cheated on. Jake knows about my past and has been very understanding and supportive.

A few days ago, Jake left his phone on the couch while he went to take a shower. I was sitting next to it, and I could see notifications popping up from his friends. It got me curious, and before I knew it, I found myself scrolling through his old messages. I didn't have a particular reason for doing it; I just felt this overwhelming need to make sure he wasn't hiding anything.

To my surprise, I found some old conversations with his ex, which were fairly harmless but included a few flirty comments from when they were still dating. These messages were from over two years ago, well before we even met. But they made me feel uneasy because the way he flirted with her seemed so natural and effortless.

When Jake came out of the shower, I confronted him about the messages. He was confused at first and then got pretty upset, asking why I was going through his phone without his permission. He explained that those messages were ancient and that he hasn't spoken to his ex since they broke up. He reminded me that he's always been open with me and has never given me any reason to doubt him.

My friends are split on this. Some think I had a right to know my boyfriend's past and that his reaction was overblown. Others say I violated his privacy and that my actions scream insecurity and lack of trust. Jake has been distant since the incident, and it's clear that I've hurt him.

I understand that going through his phone was a betrayal of trust, but I also feel like I need reassurance sometimes because of my past. Am I the asshole for scrolling through my boyfriend's old messages and questioning his trustworthiness?","My boyfriend (25) and I (23) have been together for two years. We've had our ups and downs, but things have been good lately. However, I've been feeling a bit uneasy about his past relationships. He's been pretty open with me about his exes, but there's one girl in particular that's been nagging at me.

We were watching TV together one night and his phone buzzed with a notification from an old chat thread with her. I didn't think much of it, but then I saw that they were still texting each other. I asked him about it, and he brushed it off saying it was just a friend she was looking for advice on something.

The next night, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and my curiosity got the best of me. I went through his old messages (he had them saved on his phone) and saw that they had been in a pretty intense relationship. There were even some flirtatious messages that made me feel uncomfortable. I couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't being completely honest with me.

So, I brought it up with him again, and he got defensive, saying I was being paranoid and that I didn't trust him. I told him I just wanted to understand what happened with her, and he said it was a long time ago and he's moved on. But the thing is, the messages I saw were from just a year ago.

I'm not sure what to think. A part of me feels like I've overstepped boundaries, but another part of me wants to know the truth.

60,AITA for yelling at my mom who slept with my friend?,"So recently my mother (35-38F) was in my town. (She lives quite a bit away.) While she was in town, she apparently went to the local bar where my friend (30FTM) was.   Now it’s important to note I used to work there so I basically know everyone there and my brother even works there currently.   My friend, I’ll call them B, told my friend (19F, calling her E) that they had slept with my mother and didn’t know it was her until like the day after.   After E told me, I was obviously upset so I called my mother. She answered and I just started yelling at her. I can admit that was not one of my better moments… but you find out your mother slept with one of your friends and you’d be pissed too.   So, while on the phone with my mother, she told me that I “cant control what she does” and “I should get friends my own age.”  Note: i’ve been friends with people 3+ years older than me since i was like 13 😭.   Another note: my mother is a lesbian and doesn’t know about B transitioning and has stated before she doesn’t want to be in a relationship with someone transitioning as it’s too much for her to handle both their mental health and her own. She’s not transphobic or homophobic I can tell you that.   My friend E has told me I am not the asshole, however since talking to my mother about what she did I have barely talked to my mother. I told her she could pursue a relationship with MY friend or talk to me, but I would not be talking to her if she pursues a relationship with my friend. Texts here and there for doctor appointments. I also haven’t talked to my friend, B. AITA for this?  EDIT: feedback said i am TA, but i’d like to note my friend (B, 30) was bragging about it to the bartenders and the other staff.

Up until recently, I thought our bond was pretty solid. I also have a close-knit group of friends, and we’ve always been open about discussing our thoughts and feelings on various topics. Recently, my mom started dating someone new, which I was initially excited about for her. 

However, I was shocked when I found out that her new partner is a 30-year-old trans woman. I’m not against trans people—don’t get me wrong—but I was taken aback by the age difference and the fact that my mom had never dated anyone who was not cisgender. I expressed my concerns to my mom about this new relationship, mainly around the age gap and the lifestyle differences that I imagined might be there. My mom brushed off my concerns, saying she was happy and that was what mattered.

I started talking to my friends about it, and to my surprise, many of them echoed my worries. We discussed how it might be difficult for my mom to navigate this new relationship, given the differences in experiences. I felt justified in my concerns and thought I was just looking out for her. But then my mom found out that I was discussing her relationship with my friends and felt betrayed. She felt like I was gossiping about her life choices instead of supporting her.

Things escalated. I stood firm in my belief that I shouldn’t have to accept her dating someone so much younger—someone I felt was potentially taking advantage of her. My mom expressed her disappointment, saying I should be supportive of her happiness. In frustration, I ended up cutting her off for a while, thinking it would send a message about how I felt, and that maybe she would reconsider her relationship.

Now it’s been a few weeks, and I feel awful. My mom is heartbroken, and our conversations have turned tense, even around family gatherings. My friends have mixed opinions, some think I was justified while others have gently nudged me to reconsider my stance. 

I’ve started to realize that my actions may have been overly harsh, and that maybe I should have approached the situation differently. So, AITA for cutting off my mom and her friend because she's dating a 30-year-old trans woman?","I (23F) have a close-knit group of friends, and among them is my best friend, Sarah (24F). Sarah and I have been friends since high school, and we share almost everything with each other. Recently, something happened that caused a rift between us, and I'm struggling to figure out if I'm in the wrong here.

A few weeks ago, Sarah introduced us to her new girlfriend, Jess (30F). Jess is a trans woman, and while I have no issue with her gender identity, I was taken aback by the age difference. Sarah has always been a bit of a free spirit, and I worried that Jess might be taking advantage of her.

I tried to express my concerns to Sarah privately, but she shut me down, saying that she was happy and that Jess treats her well. Still, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something off about their relationship, mainly because of the age gap.

Things came to a head when we were all hanging out at a mutual friend's house. Jess made a comment about how she and Sarah were thinking about moving in together, and I kind of lost it. I voiced my concerns in front of everyone, saying that Sarah was too young to be making such a big decision with someone so much older and that Jess might be manipulating her.

Sarah was furious and stormed out with Jess. Later, she texted me saying that she couldn't believe I would embarrass her like that and question her ability to make her own choices. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for her, but she wouldn't hear it.

Since then, I've cut off contact with both Sarah and Jess. I told Sarah that I couldn't be friends with her if she insisted on dating someone so much older who might be manipulating her. Our mutual friends are split on the issue. Some think I'm right to be concerned, while others believe I overstepped and should apologize.

My mom got wind of the situation and told me I was being judgmental and unfair, especially since I hadn't even given Jess a proper chance. She said that I was the one being unreasonable and that Sarah deserves my support, not my judgment.

Now, I'm left questioning if I'm really the asshole here. I genuinely thought I was looking out for my friend, but maybe I went about it the wrong way.

So, AITA for cutting off my mom and friend because she's dating a 30-year-old trans woman?","I've known my mom's friend, let's call her Rachel, for years. We've been super close since we were in high school. When I found out she was dating a 30-year-old trans woman named Jamie, I was taken aback. I mean, I'm not homophobic or transphobic, but I just didn't think it was right for her to be with someone that much younger than her, and someone who's still going through transition.

Rachel and I had a conversation about it, and I expressed my concerns. She told me that Jamie is a great person, and that she loves her, but I just couldn't get on board. We've been friends for so long, and I feel like I have a right to be upset.

I tried to be understanding and support her, but it just didn't feel right. I told her that if she's going to be with Jamie, I need some space from her, and I need her to understand why. Rachel got really upset and told me that I was being intolerant and that I was hurting her feelings.

We had a huge argument, and it ended with me telling her that I didn't want to be friends with her anymore if she's going to be with Jamie. Rachel was devastated, and she's been trying to get me to talk to her and make amends, but I just can't do it. I feel like I'm being honest and true to myself, but I also feel like I'm being a bad friend.

My mom is really upset with me, too. She says that I'm being judgmental and that I should just accept Rachel's relationship for what it is. But I just can't help how I feel. I feel like I'm being disloyal to my mom by cutting off Rachel, but at the same time, I feel like I'm being true to myself.

Sarah and I have been friends since high school, and we share almost everything with each other. Recently, something happened that caused a rift between us, and I'm struggling to figure out if I'm in the wrong here.\n\nA few weeks ago, Sarah introduced us to her new girlfriend, Jess (30F). Jess is a trans woman, and while I have no issue with her gender identity, I was taken aback by the age difference. Sarah has always been a bit of a free spirit, and I worried that Jess might be taking advantage of her.\n\nI tried to express my concerns to Sarah privately, but she shut me down, saying that she was happy and that Jess treats her well. Still, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something off about their relationship, mainly because of the age gap.\n\nThings came to a head when we were all hanging out at a mutual friend's house. Jess made a comment about how she and Sarah were thinking about moving in together, and I kind of lost it. I voiced my concerns in front of everyone, saying that Sarah was too young to be making such a big decision with someone so much older and that Jess might be manipulating her.\n\nSarah was furious and stormed out with Jess. Later, she texted me saying that she couldn't believe I would embarrass her like that and question her ability to make her own choices. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for her, but she wouldn't hear it.\n\nSince then, I've cut off contact with both Sarah and Jess. I told Sarah that I couldn't be friends with her if she insisted on dating someone so much older who might be manipulating her. Our mutual friends are split on the issue. Some think I'm right to be concerned, while others believe I overstepped and should apologize.\n\nMy mom got wind of the situation and told me I was being judgmental and unfair, especially since I hadn't even given Jess a proper chance. She said that I was the one being unreasonable and that Sarah deserves my support, not my judgment.\n\nNow, I'm left questioning if I'm really the asshole here. I genuinely thought I was looking out for my friend, but maybe I went about it the wrong way.\n\nSo, AITA for cutting off my mom and friend because she's dating a 30-year-old trans woman?""}]","{

61,AITA for refusing to consider people who were not wearing costumes for a costume party?,"My organization on campus always hosts a huge Halloween party. I have been every year since I was a freshman and given that I am a senior this year it was my opportunity to help plan it.  I was asked to handle the costume contest. I was the head judge. The way it works is that all the other organizations choose one member of their group to submit for the best costume and we pick one male org and one female org member to win.  In past years, I have never particularly liked how the costumes were judged. The male costumes were always good, but the female costumes were just not great. They went with the typical girl Halloween costume. We always had some girls that show up in real costumes and not just string and a prop. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn’t be winning the costume contest.  So the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.  We looked at each contestant and we’re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.  This girl was in a Trixie Tang costume from Fairly Odd Parents. The other judge was not a fan of it so she did not want her to win. But all the other girls weren’t in costumes. We debated it before I said that I would just say whoever she said was the winner to get her to shut her mouth. This was a lie and when I announced the winner, I explicitly said that Trixie Tang won because she has the best actual costume of all of the lady entries.  The other judge was mad and the girls from the losing groups were not happy. They said I judged unfairly. The president of my org co-signed my decision and said that the outcome was fine. We awarded the prize and everything was cool, but after that, none of the girls from the orgs that lost wouldn’t talk to me. The other judge told me I was a dick and lied to her which I guess is true, but our house our rules and our près. Was cool with it.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn’t be winning the costume contest.  So the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.  We looked at each contestant and we’re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.  This girl was in a Trixie Tang costume from Fairly Odd Parents. The other judge was not a fan of it so she did not want her to win. But all the other girls weren’t in costumes. We debated it before I said that I would just say whoever she said was the winner to get her to shut her mouth. This was a lie and when I announced the winner, I explicitly said that Trixie Tang won because she has the best actual costume of all of the lady entries.  The other judge was mad and the girls from the losing groups were not happy. They said I judged unfairly. The president of my org co-signed my decision and said that the outcome was fine. We awarded the prize and everything was cool, but after that, none of the girls from the orgs that lost wouldn’t talk to me. The other judge told me I was a dick and lied to her which I guess is true, but our house our rules and our près. Was cool with it.  AITA?'}]","OP, a senior, was in charge of the costume contest at a Halloween party on campus. They decided to only judge real costumes, which led to a dispute with another judge who didn't agree with this rule. OP lied about the reason for choosing the winner, saying it was because of the quality of the costume, when in reality it was a default choice. This dishonesty led to a negative impact on their relationships with the other judge and the girls from the losing groups, who felt that OP had judged unfairly.",AITA for Lying About the Costume Contest Winner and Hurting Relationships?,"Judgement: YTA, Title: AITA for Lying About the Costume Contest Winner and Hurting Relationships?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

I'm in a bit of a predicament and could use some unbiased opinions. I recently hosted a Halloween party, and it was a blast! Everyone came dressed in fantastic costumes, and we ended the night with a costume contest. The prize was a gift card to a popular local restaurant, which everyone was excited about.

Now, here’s where things took a turn. There was one costume that really stood out to me: my friend Lisa came dressed as a historical figure, and she put a ton of effort into it. However, my other friend Mark, who often wins these things, dressed as a classic monster, and everybody else seemed to love it. When it came time to announce the winner, I felt pressured by the crowd to pick Mark, even though I personally thought Lisa deserved it more. 

In a moment of weakness, I announced Mark as the winner, and everyone cheered, but I could see Lisa's face fall. After the party, Lisa confronted me, and I confessed that I’d picked Mark to appease the crowd rather than being honest about who I thought truly deserved it. This upset her even more, and she said I’d hurt her feelings and damaged our friendship. 

Now, some friends are on Lisa's side, saying I should have just stuck to my principles and been honest about who I thought won. Others are saying I did what I felt was best for the group dynamic at the time. I did apologize to Lisa and offered to have a rerun of the contest where she could be the winner, but she declined, saying that it wouldn't change how she felt.

So here I am, wondering if I really messed up or if I was just trying to keep the peace. AITA for lying about the costume contest winner and hurting relationships in the process?","Hey all,

I'm writing here because I need some perspective on a situation that has gotten way out of hand. Recently, I hosted a Halloween party at my place and decided to have a costume contest with a pretty nice prize – a $100 gift card to a fancy restaurant. I invited all my friends and some colleagues. Everything was going great until it came time to announce the costume contest winner.

One of my close friends, Sarah, came dressed as an incredible Maleficent. Her costume was detailed and obviously took a lot of time and effort. Meanwhile, my colleague, Dave, who I don't know that well but have been trying to get in good with for work reasons, came dressed as a generic vampire. His costume was okay, but definitely not as impressive as Sarah's.

As the party was winding down, I got nervous that Dave might feel left out and that it could negatively affect our work relationship. I know, it's stupid. So, when it came time to announce the winner, I said that Dave had won. The room went silent for a moment before some polite claps followed. Sarah looked crushed, and some of my friends gave me looks of disbelief. I handed Dave the gift card, and he seemed happy enough, but the mood of the party shifted immediately.

The next day, Sarah confronted me, asking why I lied about the winner. She felt humiliated and said that it was obvious to everyone that her costume was the best. We had a big argument, and now she's barely speaking to me. Some of my other friends have also been distant and mentioned that it was unfair to Sarah.

At work, things didn't get better either. Dave got wind of the situation and, unbeknownst to me, he actually voted for Sarah as well. He returned the gift card, stating that he didn't feel right keeping it.

Now, I'm stuck in a situation where I've hurt a close friend and lost credibility among my peers. My intention was to avoid any potential awkwardness with Dave, but it seems like I've only made things worse.

So, was I the asshole for lying about the costume contest winner and hurting my relationships?","Throw away for privacy. Fake names.

My sister, Emily (28 F), and I, Rachel (29 F), are super close. We've been friends since childhood and our friendship has withstood many trials and tribulations. Our friendship group includes our siblings, brother Michael (25 M) and sister-in-law Sarah (27 F), and our best friends, Alex (29 M) and Jamie (28 F). We all love Halloween and every year we throw a huge party with a costume contest. 

This year, Emily decided to enter the contest with a last-minute costume and her entry, a zombie bride, absolutely killed it. In my opinion, it was the best costume of the night and I made sure to tell everyone how much I loved it. Emily won the contest and was really thrilled about it. However, things took a turn when Michael and Sarah's friend, Rachel (25 F), complained that the judging was unfair because her own costume, a rather basic Wonder Woman, was robbed of the prize. Rachel is also Emily's coworker and they've been friendly but not close.

The situation escalated when Rachel started sending passive-aggressive messages to Emily and our group, claiming that the judging was rigged and that Emily had manipulated the judges. Emily, being the sweet and caring person she is, tried to reason with Rachel and explained that the judges had randomly picked the winner, but Rachel refused to listen. I decided to step in and tell Rachel that I had actually been one of the judges and that Emily's costume was truly the best that night, but I didn't want to hurt Rachel's feelings so I told her I had accidentally miscounted the points. Rachel still wasn't satisfied and started spreading rumors that Emily and I had conspired to cheat her out of the prize. 

This has caused a rift between Emily and Rachel, and it's also put a strain on our relationships with Michael and Sarah, who feel caught in the middle. Emily is devastated and feels betrayed by my actions. I feel awful about what I've done, but I was trying to protect Emily's feelings and avoid hurting Rachel's ego. However, I realize now that I should have just been honest with Rachel from the start.

AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for Blaming My Husband for Calling the Police Over a $9 Tip Dispute?'}]","I never thought I’d be in a situation where I’d have to write about this, but here we are. My husband and I went out to a local diner last weekend for a quick dinner. The place was pretty busy, and we were both a little stressed after a long week of work and taking care of our two kids. 

When the check came, I noticed that it was a little higher than expected. The service had been okay, but it wasn’t great. I figured a 15% tip was fair, so I left a tip of about $9 on a $60 bill. I thought this was reasonable considering how crowded it was and how our server had forgotten my drink order. My husband, however, didn't agree. He insisted that we should tip at least 20%, stating that it's important to support service workers, especially during busy times. 

I could see where he was coming from, but I felt that a smaller tip was warranted for the service we received. We started to argue about it right there at the table, which probably wasn’t ideal, but it was one of those moments where both of us were a bit heated. Eventually, I just told him to drop it, and we left the diner.

Well, we get home, and my husband is still fuming over the tip. Instead of letting it go, he decides to grab his phone and call the diner to complain about the service and how we were treated. I was stunned. It’s just a tip! I felt embarrassed and didn’t want the restaurant to think we were the type of customers who would call and complain over something so petty. 

After he finished the call, I told him that he was overreacting and it made me feel ashamed. He argued that someone needed to stand up for fair service and that I should support him in that sentiment. I wasn’t comfortable with how he handled the situation and expressed that the whole thing was just ridiculous. 

Friends who knew about the incident had mixed feelings. Some sided with me, saying that it's not worth ruining a restaurant's reputation over a $9 tip, while others thought my husband was justified in speaking out. This split made me realize that maybe we both could have handled the situation better. 

In the end, we both felt frustrated and disappointed, and while I don’t condone my husband's actions, I also know I could have been more understanding in our debate over the tip. So, AITA for blaming my husband for calling the diner over a $9 tip dispute?","My husband and I went out for dinner a couple of nights ago to this new restaurant in town that everyone was raving about. We had a great time, the food was delicious, and the service was pretty good too. Everything was going smoothly until the bill came.

We noticed that a tip of $9 had been added to our bill. We usually tip generously, but we prefer to decide the amount ourselves. My husband flagged down our server and politely asked why the tip had been included. The server explained that it was a new policy for parties of two or more.

My husband was visibly annoyed by this and asked to speak to the manager. When the manager came over and reiterated the policy, my husband got upset and demanded they remove the tip. The manager refused, explaining that it was a policy set by the restaurant and they couldn’t make exceptions.

Now, here’s where it escalates. My husband insisted that it was illegal to mandate a tip and threatened to call the police. I tried to diffuse the situation, suggesting we just pay the bill and leave, but he was adamant. He dialed 911 right there in the restaurant.

The police actually showed up, and it became a spectacle. The officers listened to both sides and eventually told us that while it might be unusual, it wasn’t a criminal matter. They suggested we either pay the bill as is or take it up with the restaurant owners later. We ended up paying the bill, including the $9 tip, and left the restaurant.

Since then, my husband has been furious, saying the restaurant was out of line. I, on the other hand, think he overreacted by involving the police over a tip. When we got home, I told him he shouldn't have called the police over something so trivial, and that it was embarrassing and unnecessary.

My friends and family are divided. Some agree with me, saying it was an overreaction, while others think the restaurant's policy was shady and my husband was right to stand up for our rights as customers.

Now, our evening out has become this big, uncomfortable issue, and it's put a strain on our relationship. I feel conflicted because I understand he was frustrated, but I still think calling the police was too much.

Am I the asshole for blaming my husband for calling the police over a $9 tip dispute?","My husband (35) and I (33) own a small, casual restaurant. We have a decent reputation and a regular customer base. One evening, a family came in for dinner. They seemed nice, and we got them seated and served their meal promptly.


After they finished, they left a $9 tip on a $50 bill. My husband overheard the husband of the couple mention that they had left the tip ""on purpose"" because of some issue with a previous server. My husband politely asked them what was wrong, and they explained that they had left a large tip once before but were overcharged for their food. They said they were still waiting for the issue to be resolved.


My husband apologized and explained that the previous server had made a mistake, but they had already been taken care of. The husband became agitated and demanded to speak to the manager. My husband offered to speak to the manager, but the husband insisted that the police be called.


The police arrived, and my husband explained the situation to them. The officers were understanding and left without taking any further action. The couple, however, left with their tails between their legs.


I found out about the whole ordeal from my husband, who was visibly shaken. I was angry and felt that he had overreacted by calling the police. I told him that he should have just apologized and moved on, rather than escalating the situation. He said that he had called the police because the couple had threatened him and he was scared.


The family has been posting negative reviews online, claiming that we overcharged them and that the police were called because they were ""racially profiled."" My husband is getting a lot of backlash from friends and family, who are saying that he overreacted and that we should have just given them a discount.


I'm starting to wonder if I'm the asshole for blaming my husband for calling the police. He was scared, and he did what he thought was best in the moment. But on the other hand, maybe he did overreact, and we should have just given them a discount to avoid the whole situation.

63,AITA for asking my dying father to sell his house to me for cheap as a condition to see him before he dies?,"My (31F) father was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and doesn't have a lot of time left according to his wife, and they are struggling financially after paying for his wife's medical bills.   I asked her to send me his reports because I wanted to verify everything before I engaged with them.   Turns out she was saying the truth, and he is actually sick. Now as a condition of seeing him before he passes and helping him out financially, I asked him to sell my childhood home to me at 1/10th of its current market price.    I got it cheap. I refused to dole out easy money. The house means a lot to me, It's the house my mom picked out and it's the home I hope to raise my family in once I have kids. He  agreed, albeit reluctantly, because he has no other option right now.   The sale has gone through and the house is legally mine now. The money he got from the sale will help him get proper hospice care.   I will be flying out to another country in a few weeks, but his wife is insisting I stay and help her out with some of his care.   His wife is accusing me of cheating a dying man of his money and being a selfish prick. But has has already seen me. I visited him and helped him out financially by buying the house. I held up my end of the bargain.  AITA for refusing to engage with him any further?   *****  Edit : a lot of people has asked me the reason for the estrangement. The reason is simple. He fucked my mom over. He contributed directly to her decline and eventual death.   He and his wife agreed to my conditions. I didn't want to see him. But I did because he agreed to the sale.

Although she claims she's doing this to help him, her true motives seem to be driven by her own self-interest, as she's been estranged from him due to his past actions. She visits him once to fulfill her end of the bargain, but then refuses to engage with him further, leading his wife to accuse her of being selfish and cheating her husband out of money. OP's actions come across as emotionally manipulative and exploitative, especially considering her father's desperate situation and her own unwillingness to provide emotional support during his final days.","'AITA for Selling My Childhood Home to My Father at a Low Price, Then Ghosting Him?'","Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Selling My Childhood Home to My Father at a Low Price, Then Ghosting Him?'","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :\n\n“i have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.”\n\nI was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)\n\nI guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me. I often mimic people’s personality and humor to fit with them, so after we had been friends for so long we were practically the same person. everyone said that, even our moms. So i thought that since my jokes were basically hers, everything was fine. So am I the asshole?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Selling My Childhood Home to My Father at a Low Price, Then Ghosting Him?'""}]","I, 25, inherited my childhood home after my mom passed away a couple of years ago. It was a tough time for me, as my mom and I were extremely close, and losing her hit me hard. She always wanted me to do well, and I knew she would want me to use the house for my own future instead of holding onto it as a relic of the past.

After doing some thinking and consulting with a financial advisor, I decided it would be best to sell the house. My dad, who had a rocky relationship with my mom and me for years, expressed interest in buying it. I knew he was having financial struggles, and I wanted to help him out, so I sold it to him at a significantly lower price than market value. I thought it would help mend our relationship, and it felt right at the time.

However, after closing the sale, I realized I made a huge mistake. My dad immediately turned around and started making changes to the house—coloring the walls, ripping out the garden my mom loved, and even adding an awful fence. It felt like he was erasing my mom’s memory from the one place that held all our family memories, and I couldn’t handle it. Every time I drove by, it made me feel sick. The place where I had cherished moments was becoming unrecognizable.

I decided to step back and ghost him. I felt like I needed to preserve my mom’s memory in the only way I could, and I didn’t want to hear his excuses about “it being his house now.” I completely cut off communication, and it’s been several months since I last spoke to him.

Friends and family have mixed opinions on my actions. Some think it was an emotional decision and understandable given the grief I was experiencing. Others, however, say I let my emotions get the better of me and that I should have communicated my feelings to my dad rather than shutting him out. They believe that ghosting him after such a significant transaction was immature and unfair, especially since I initially did it to help him.

Now I’m left wondering if I went too far—did I make a mistake by selling the house to him in the first place? And am I the asshole for ghosting him after doing so?","My parents divorced when I was 12, and I went to live with my mom while my dad stayed in our childhood home. It was a nasty split, and my relationship with my dad was strained for years. Fast forward to a couple of years ago, my mom passed away and I inherited her portion of the house, making me a joint owner with my dad.

My dad reached out wanting to buy my share, which he really couldn't afford at market value. Since I have a good job and didn't need the money immediately, I agreed to sell it to him at a significantly reduced price, thinking it would help mend some of our lingering issues and give him some peace of mind. I figured this would be a win-win; he gets to stay in the house he loves, and I get to help him out while still making a bit of money.

The transaction went smoothly, but as soon as the papers were signed, he started acting like he didn't need me in his life anymore. Suddenly, he was too busy to talk or hang out. He never said it outright, but it felt like he just used me to get the house for cheap and then discarded me. 

About a month after the sale, I decided to cut ties and ghosted him. I stopped answering his calls, unfriended him on social media, and essentially removed him from my life. Maybe it was petty, but I felt hurt and used. 

I talked about this with a few friends and family members, and they had mixed reactions. Some understood why I was upset and supported my decision to distance myself, but others thought I acted rashly and should have addressed my feelings with him directly. My sister even accused me of being money-hungry, saying that my dad probably felt guilty for taking the house at a reduced price and that's why he pulled away.

Now, it's been about six months since I last spoke to him, and I'm starting to question my actions. Maybe I should have handled it differently, but at the time, it felt like the only way to protect myself from further emotional hurt.

Was I the asshole for selling him the house at a low price and then ghosting him?","I recently sold my childhood home to my father (55) at a price that, in hindsight, was far lower than it was worth. It had been in our family for decades, and he's been wanting it for years, but I always held onto the sentimental value of it. My mom passed away a couple of years ago, and I was finally ready to let it go.

My dad and I have never been super close, but we've always had a decent relationship. He's a bit of a hoarder and has never been great at maintaining property, but he's also been very generous to me in the past, especially after my mom passed away.

We agreed on a price, and I thought we had a deal. However, after signing the papers, I started to feel a bit uneasy about the whole thing. My dad had been making plans to renovate and sell the house, which made me realize that I had given up a lot of equity for what I thought was a fair price.

Anyway, I started to distance myself from my dad, and eventually, I just stopped responding to his calls and messages. He's been trying to reach me for weeks, and I just can't deal with the guilt and anxiety of what I did.

My friends think I'm an asshole for selling the house to my dad at such a low price and then ghosting him. They say I should have been more honest with him about my feelings and that I'm just avoiding the consequences of my actions.

I know I'm not the most responsible person, and I've made some questionable decisions in the past, but I really thought I was doing the right thing at the time. I guess I just wasn't ready to deal with the fallout, and now I'm stuck with the guilt of what I did.

It was a nasty split, and my relationship with my dad was strained for years. Fast forward to a couple of years ago, my mom passed away and I inherited her portion of the house, making me a joint owner with my dad.\n\nMy dad reached out wanting to buy my share, which he really couldn't afford at market value. Since I have a good job and didn't need the money immediately, I agreed to sell it to him at a significantly reduced price, thinking it would help mend some of our lingering issues and give him some peace of mind. I figured this would be a win-win; he gets to stay in the house he loves, and I get to help him out while still making a bit of money.\n\nThe transaction went smoothly, but as soon as the papers were signed, he started acting like he didn't need me in his life anymore. Suddenly, he was too busy to talk or hang out. He never said it outright, but it felt like he just used me to get the house for cheap and then discarded me. \n\nAbout a month after the sale, I decided to cut ties and ghosted him. I stopped answering his calls, unfriended him on social media, and essentially removed him from my life. Maybe it was petty, but I felt hurt and used. \n\nI talked about this with a few friends and family members, and they had mixed reactions. Some understood why I was upset and supported my decision to distance myself, but others thought I acted rashly and should have addressed my feelings with him directly. My sister even accused me of being money-hungry, saying that my dad probably felt guilty for taking the house at a reduced price and that's why he pulled away.\n\nNow, it's been about six months since I last spoke to him, and I'm starting to question my actions. Maybe I should have handled it differently, but at the time, it felt like the only way to protect myself from further emotional hurt.\n\nWas I the asshole for selling him the house at a low price and then ghosting him?""}]","{

64,"AITA for yelling at my ""friend""?","Hey reddit. I feel like I'm justified in this but based on a few arguments with friends I figured I'd post here.  Me and my friends all go to the same college, and we're all in a group chat together. We all have a kind of edgy sense of humor, and we end up toeing the line or making jokes at the expense of other people quite a bit. More often than not these are jokes that end up using ""slurs"" or other language that's deemed offensive today. For contexts sake I should mention that none of us are black or gay but we say N- or F- slurs pretty often.  One guy in the group has a history of telling us off for making jokes like these. One time last year one of the group members made a joke about his girlfriend that got him on his period or whatever and he left the group chat. We talked with him about it and his big issue was that he felt like we were bad people for cursing like that in the group chat. We told him we'd stop out of respect for him and we did, and he came back and joined the group. We've all been hanging out together since but I guess we fell back into the habit of making jokes like that again. The one guy continued to tell us to stop, and say that it was wrong for us to use language like that, but it felt kinda playful like he didn't really mean it so we brushed it off.  Well, I guess it was less playful because he reported us to the faculty of the school we go to. We all had to have meetings with somebody from the office of discipline. We felt really hurt and betrayed by our so called ""friend"". We basically got him in a room and asked him why he felt the need to report us and he tried to deny it, but then said that he wished he DID report us because the language we used and the jokes we made were ""sickening"". This is where I kind of lost my temper and started yelling. I told him that he was way out of line for reporting us to the office, that he was a snake for it. I have a scholarship and a job offer and he literally gambled it all over something as little as a few curse words or dark jokes- JOKES- about his girlfriend. He told me that he knew we weren't really joking and that we deserved what we got. We're still in college, we have our whole lives ahead of us. It isn't fair of him to risk my scholarship and my future career over a few mistakes we made when we were kids.  We haven't talked to him since. We're basically his only friends so nobody knows what he's been up to. I was complaining about the whole situation to a friend from high school when he said that I was an ass for yelling, that I should have just stayed calm about it. AITA?

I feel like I\'m justified in this but based on a few arguments with friends I figured I\'d post here.  Me and my friends all go to the same college, and we\'re all in a group chat together. We all have a kind of edgy sense of humor, and we end up toeing the line or making jokes at the expense of other people quite a bit. More often than not these are jokes that end up using ""slurs"" or other language that\'s deemed offensive today. For contexts sake I should mention that none of us are black or gay but we say N- or F- slurs pretty often.  One guy in the group has a history of telling us off for making jokes like these. One time last year one of the group members made a joke about his girlfriend that got him on his period or whatever and he left the group chat. We talked with him about it and his big issue was that he felt like we were bad people for cursing like that in the group chat. We told him we\'d stop out of respect for him and we did, and he came back and joined the group. We\'ve all been hanging out together since but I guess we fell back into the habit of making jokes like that again. The one guy continued to tell us to stop, and say that it was wrong for us to use language like that, but it felt kinda playful like he didn\'t really mean it so we brushed it off.  Well, I guess it was less playful because he reported us to the faculty of the school we go to. We all had to have meetings with somebody from the office of discipline. We felt really hurt and betrayed by our so called ""friend"". We basically got him in a room and asked him why he felt the need to report us and he tried to deny it, but then said that he wished he DID report us because the language we used and the jokes we made were ""sickening"". This is where I kind of lost my temper and started yelling. I told him that he was way out of line for reporting us to the office, that he was a snake for it. I have a scholarship and a job offer and he literally gambled it all over something as little as a few curse words or dark jokes- JOKES- about his girlfriend. He told me that he knew we weren\'t really joking and that we deserved what we got. We\'re still in college, we have our whole lives ahead of us. It isn\'t fair of him to risk my scholarship and my future career over a few mistakes we made when we were kids.  We haven\'t talked to him since. We\'re basically his only friends so nobody knows what he\'s been up to. I was complaining about the whole situation to a friend from high school when he said that I was an ass for yelling, that I should have just stayed calm about it. AITA?  TLDR: friend reported us over a joke, I yelled at him for it.

When this friend reported them to the faculty, OP lost their temper and yelled at him, accusing him of being a'snake' for trying to hold them accountable. OP failed to acknowledge the potential harm caused by their group's behavior and instead focused on their own perceived victimhood, which led to a rift in their friendship.",'AITA for Losing My Temper at a Friend Who Reported Our Group Chat for Being Racist?',"Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Losing My Temper at a Friend Who Reported Our Group Chat for Being Racist?'","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

While we all have our inside jokes, we’ve definitely crossed the line a few times, laughing about things that, in hindsight, weren’t appropriate. I never really thought about the implications of our jokes because it felt like harmless fun among friends.

Recently, a friend named ""Jake"" took it upon himself to report our group chat for being racist. He claimed that some of the jokes we made were harmful and perpetuated negative stereotypes. I won’t lie; I was furious when I found out. I felt betrayed that he would go behind our backs and report us instead of just speaking up in the group chat. To me, it felt like a huge overreaction, and I saw it as Jake trying to portray us as bad people when we were just joking. 

When I confronted Jake about it, I lost my temper. I told him he was being overly sensitive and that he was ruining our group dynamic. I made it clear that I didn’t appreciate him taking things too far and that we should be able to joke freely without someone policing us. The conversation escalated, and I ended up saying some hurtful things that I really regret. The other friends in our group were caught in the middle, and while some supported Jake, others felt I was right to be upset.

Jake ultimately decided to step away from the group chat, and now there’s this awkward tension hanging over our friend group. I’ve talked to a couple of friends since then, and they’ve told me that I was out of line for losing my temper and not being more mindful of our jokes. They believe that Jake had a point in feeling that our humor could be harmful.

I recognize that my reaction was harsh, and while I still think reporting was an extreme step, I’m beginning to wonder if I might be the asshole for how I handled the situation. Am I the asshole for losing my temper at a friend who reported our group chat for being racist?","I’m part of a group chat with some buddies from college. We’ve been friends for years, and the chat is usually full of jokes, memes, and general banter. Recently, a new friend, ""Alex,"" joined the group. Alex is a bit more serious and doesn’t always get our sense of humor, but we thought he was a good fit since he’s generally a nice guy.

Last week, someone shared a meme that was, in retrospect, pretty offensive. Most of us laughed it off, but Alex immediately called it out for being racist. Some of the guys brushed him off and told him to lighten up, but Alex wasn’t having it. 

A day later, we received notifications that the group chat had been reported for racist content, and some of us got temp bans from the messaging app. We quickly realized it was Alex who had reported us. Frankly, I was livid. I felt betrayed that Alex would take it upon himself to report us instead of just talking it out. We could’ve deleted the message or even kicked out the person who posted it if it was such a big deal.

I exploded on Alex in the new group chat we made (without him, of course). I accused him of jeopardizing our years-long friendship over a joke and overreacting. I said some pretty harsh things, including that if he couldn’t handle our humor, he should’ve just left instead of snitching to the app moderators.

Alex tried to defend himself, saying that the meme was hurtful and that he didn’t feel safe in a space where such content was being shared. He claimed he reported it because he felt like his concerns were being ignored and that it was less about the joke itself and more about the culture of the chat.

Now, some of my friends think I went too far and should apologize, while others are on my side, feeling like Alex overstepped boundaries. I’m confused and frustrated. Was I the asshole for losing my temper at Alex for reporting our group chat?","I'm still fuming about the whole situation, and I know I shouldn't be, but I'm asking for your opinions on whether I was the asshole for losing my temper at my friend, Alex, after she reported our group chat for being racist.

So, Alex and I have been friends since college, and we've always been close, even though we come from different backgrounds. We have a group chat with a few other friends, and we often joke around and make light of sensitive topics. It's always been a bit of a sensitive topic, but we thought we were all on the same page. We'd often make jokes about our own cultures and stereotypes, but never meant to offend anyone.

Recently, one of our friends, Emily, joined the chat, and she's super into social justice and woke culture. She's always calling out people for their ""microaggressions"" and ""cultural appropriation."" To be honest, we thought she was just being a buzzkill, but we tried to roll with it.

Last week, Emily reported our group chat for being racist, and Alex was the one who told us about it. I was furious, not because I think our jokes were racist (I know they were stupid, but not malicious), but because I felt like Alex betrayed us. I felt like she sold us out to the woke police.

When I confronted Alex, I lost my temper. I yelled at her for being a ""snitch"" and for not having our backs. I told her that if she had a problem with our jokes, she should've spoken up, not gone behind our backs and reported us. Alex was taken aback by my reaction, and she told me that I was being unreasonable and that she was just trying to do the right thing.

Now, our group chat is frozen, and Emily is giving us a hard time about it. Alex and I are not speaking, and I'm feeling pretty isolated. I know I overreacted, but I still feel like Alex was the asshole for reporting us.

I guess what I'm asking is: YTA for losing my temper, or was Alex the asshole for betraying our trust?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I’m part of a group chat with some buddies from college.

65,AITA for bringing up the past with someone who's sick?,"Two years ago, I was at the end of a professional training programme and one of my appraisals went very badly (I was essentially held back due to a lack of progression - those good at math may be able to link this timing to a global health problem where disruption could have impacted on my training goals).

It was highly insulting and I was very concerned about the reputational damage that could be caused from such a comment - but I was a trainee and not in a position to challenge it. I don't think that the person who made the comment ever found out that I was told what she had said.  In the end, I managed to finish my training. I recently reached out to the person who made the comment and they were very happy to hear from me (I think they thought I wanted to catch up). But I asked them about what they said and what really did they mean by it. They immediately distanced themselves from the comment and talked about they had retired and were unwell, but that I was a good worker and that they hoped their response was satisfactory.  I responded that it wasn't. That the comment was given to me as part of formal feedback but that they had failed to address it in their email. I just got back an email saying that due to their health concerns and the fact that it's been two years, that they can't help me.

Needless to say, the class is incredibly tough. Luckily though, I have been studying since day 1 so I am doing alright in the class.

I also know for a fact that she isn\'t doing well in the class, so I got a really good idea. I would put subtle mistakes in the doc so that she wouldn\'t do well in the exam, and then I can offer to tutor her.

A couple of years back, I was in the process of buying my first home, and I was feeling both excited and nervous. I hired a retired appraiser, let's call him Mr. Johnson, to help me with some evaluations before making my final decisions. I figured his experience would provide me with valuable insights about the housing market and the specific properties I was interested in.

During one of our meetings, I mentioned some of my concerns about the prices of houses in the neighborhood I was looking at. Instead of offering constructive criticism or reassurance, Mr. Johnson made a comment that caught me completely off guard. He said, “Well, maybe you should aim for something more in your ‘price range’ instead of shooting for the stars.” It felt dismissive and condescending, and honestly, it stuck with me. 

After the meeting, I felt embarrassed and demoralized. I ended up buying a different house than I initially wanted and always wondered if I let his comment influence my decision more than I realized.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, I was discussing my home-buying journey with a friend, and the topic of Mr. Johnson's comment resurfaced. I realized that I didn’t want to let it fester any longer and decided to reach out to him via email. I wanted to express how his comment made me feel and how it impacted my confidence during a significant life decision. I figured it might provide him some insight into how his words can affect others, even if he didn’t mean it that way.

When I reached out, I thought I was being mature and addressing my feelings, but I was met with a response that was less than favorable. He seemed irritated that I would bring up something from two years ago and said that it was unprofessional of me to reach out like that. My friends, on hearing about my effort, told me I was a bit of an AH for bringing up something long past and stirring the pot.

I genuinely believed it was important to address the hurt that comment caused me, but now I’m wondering if I overstepped. AITA for reaching out to Mr. Johnson about a hurtful comment he made two years ago?","I (36F) recently reached out to a retired appraiser, Mr. Thompson (68M), who assessed the value of my late grandmother’s estate two years ago. When I first met Mr. Thompson, the appraisal process was professional yet emotionally charged for me, as I was deeply attached to many of the items being appraised. My grandmother and I were extremely close, and her passing had left a significant void in my life.

During the appraisal, Mr. Thompson made an offhand remark about one of my grandmother's jewelry pieces, stating, ""This isn't worth much. Probably just sentimental value."" At the time, I was already sensitive and grieving, and his comment felt like a dagger to my heart. I didn’t say anything in the moment, but his words stuck with me, festering over time.

Fast forward two years, and I’m still wrestling with the hurt from that comment. I recently managed to track down Mr. Thompson’s contact information. I felt that I couldn’t move on without addressing how his remark had affected me, so I called him and asked if he remembered the appraisal. To my surprise, he did.

I explained how deeply his comment had hurt me and how, despite knowing he probably didn’t mean anything by it, I couldn’t shake off the feeling of my grandmother’s legacy being diminished. Mr. Thompson sounded quite taken aback and apologized, but not without mentioning that it had been a long while and he had since retired, implying he was surprised I was still holding onto this.

My family is split on this issue. My sister thinks it was unnecessary to bring up something from so long ago, especially to someone who is now retired and likely trying to enjoy his peace. My mother, however, understands why I felt the need to address it but also feels that it’s time to let go and move on.

Since the call, I’ve been feeling conflicted. Did I do the right thing by confronting Mr. Thompson even after two years, or should I have just let bygones be bygones and moved on without reopening old wounds, especially on someone who’s likely moved past his working life?

So, AITA for reaching out to a retired appraiser two years later to discuss a hurtful comment?","Me, F 32, and my (now estranged) grandfather, M 65, were very close growing up. We would spend hours talking, fishing, and just enjoying each other's company. However, there was one incident that still bothers me to this day. When I was 18, I was considering going into the art world as a career, and I had confided in my grandfather about my dreams. He told me, in front of my entire family, that I was ""wasting my time"" and that I would ""never make a living as an artist."" He said that it was a ""frivolous"" career path and that I should focus on something more ""practical"" and ""stable."" 

He said this in front of everyone, and I was devastated. I had looked up to him my entire life and had always thought he supported me. After that, I pushed my art aspirations aside and focused on a more ""practical"" career path, which was what he wanted. 

Fast forward two years. I had become successful in my career, but I had never pursued art. I had been thinking about my grandfather's comment a lot lately, and it still hurt. I realized that his words had affected me more than I thought, and I had been holding back my passion for art because of his hurtful comment. 

I decided to reach out to my grandfather, who had since retired, to discuss his comment and how it affected me. I wanted to know why he had said it and if he still believed it. I thought maybe he would apologize and we could finally have closure. However, he immediately became defensive and told me that I was being ""sensitive"" and that I needed to ""toughen up."" He said that he was just trying to be ""realistic"" and that I should be grateful for his advice. 

He went on to say that I was being ""ungrateful"" for bringing it up after all this time and that I should just ""move on."" He ended the conversation abruptly, telling me that he didn't have time to talk about it anymore. 

I felt hurt and disappointed all over again. I realized that I was right to reach out to him, but maybe I should have left it alone.

We've been through thick and thin together, so when he started dating Sarah (27F), I was genuinely happy for him. They seemed great together, and honestly, I thought it wouldn’t change anything between us. But boy, was I wrong.

As Mark’s relationship with Sarah grew serious, I noticed a shift. He started to spend more time with her and less with me. At first, I understood. New relationships can be all-consuming, and I respected that. I gave him space, but deep down, I felt a bit neglected. I didn't want to be that friend who threw a tantrum over something I knew was natural, but it still hurt.

Fast forward a few months, and things took a turn. Mark and Sarah broke up. I felt a rush of mixed emotions. I was sad for him, of course, but part of me also thought, ""Yes! He’ll come back to me now!"" I was ready to provide the support he needed, like I always had.

However, when he got back on his feet, Mark didn’t immediately seek me out. Instead, he started hanging out with a new circle of friends he’d met through Sarah. I couldn’t help but feel a little betrayed. I had been there for him before, during, and after his relationship, and now he was just moving on without me.

So, I confronted him. I told him how I felt abandoned and expressed that I expected him to want to catch up and reconnect after everything. I knew it might sound selfish, but I believed our friendship was strong enough to handle a bit of honesty.

Mark was polite but taken aback. He said he needed time to figure his life out after the breakup and that he appreciated the friendship but couldn’t just drop everything to cater to my feelings. He mentioned that just because he wasn’t reaching out didn’t mean he didn’t care about me.

Our conversation left me feeling even more frustrated, and honestly, I didn’t understand why he couldn’t just want me back in his life like before. Now there's an awkward tension hanging over our friendship, and I can't shake the feeling that I may have pushed him away further.

I talked to a couple of mutual friends about the situation, and while some sided with me, others argued that I was being a bit unreasonable, as he has the right to prioritize his healing and new friendships.

So, AITA for expecting my best friend to still want me around after he moved on from his relationship?","I (F27) have been best friends with ""Jake"" (M28) for over a decade. We met in high school and have been inseparable ever since. We've been through everything together—college, heartbreaks, job changes. I’ve always had a bit of a crush on him, but I never acted on it because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. Plus, he never seemed to see me in that way.

About six months ago, Jake started dating ""Emily"" (F26). She’s sweet, kind, and honestly, perfect for him. They seem really happy together, and I should be happy for him, right? But instead, I’ve been feeling increasingly jealous and resentful. 

Jake and I used to spend almost all our free time together, but now, understandably, he spends most of it with Emily. We still hang out, but it’s different. The spontaneity is gone, and everything needs to be scheduled. He no longer tells me things first; Emily does. This has left me feeling like I'm losing my best friend.

Last weekend, we were at a mutual friend’s party. I had a bit too much to drink and ended up confessing to Jake that I’ve always had feelings for him. I said I didn’t understand how he could just move on and forget about me. He was understandably shocked and said that he’s happy with Emily and that I need to respect that. The rest of the night was awkward, to say the least.

Since that night, Jake has been distant. He hasn’t been returning my texts as quickly, and when we do talk, it’s very surface-level. Emily found out about my drunken confession and is understandably upset. She thinks I was trying to sabotage their relationship, and now Jake is in the middle, torn between his best friend and his girlfriend.

My other friends think I overstepped and that I shouldn’t have said anything. They believe I need to move on and let Jake be happy. But I can’t help feeling like I’ve been sidelined. I miss the closeness we once shared and feel like I’m losing a part of myself.

I get that he’s in a relationship and boundaries change, but I can’t help feeling hurt. Am I the asshole for expecting my best friend to still want me in his life the way he used to, even though he’s moved on and is happy with someone else?","I, M 25, have been best friends with my friend, M 27, since we were in college. We went through thick and thin together, and our friendship has been incredibly strong. However, things took a turn when we both started dating. I was in a long-term relationship with my girlfriend, and he was in a casual fling. It seemed to be working out for both of us, and we never thought it would affect our friendship.

Fast forward a few years, my girlfriend and I broke up, and I was devastated. My best friend, who I thought was still my rock, didn't really reach out to me like he used to. I assumed it was because he was still in a relationship himself, so I didn't pressure him. A few months went by, and I started to get back into the dating scene. I casually started seeing someone, and things started to heat up. That's when I realized my best friend had moved on from his fling and started dating someone seriously.

I thought it was great that he was happy, but I also assumed that our friendship wouldn't be affected. However, I started to notice that he wasn't really making an effort to hang out or talk to me as much as he used to. I brushed it off, thinking maybe he was just busy with his new relationship. But when I brought up the idea of us getting together for a night out, he would always come up with excuses.

It wasn't until I saw him posting about his new relationship on social media, and how happy he was, that I realized he had moved on and wasn't making an effort to maintain our friendship. I sent him a message, and he told me that he was happy for me, but he needed some space. I took that as a sign that he wasn't interested in being as close as we used to be.

I'm hurt, and I feel like he's abandoned me. I know he's happy, but I also feel like I'm being pushed out of his life. Am I being unreasonable for expecting him to still want to be friends with me, even if he's moved on?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I (F27) have been best friends with ""Jake"" (M28) for over a decade. We met in high school and have been inseparable ever since. We\'ve been through everything together—college, heartbreaks, job changes. I’ve always had a bit of a crush on him, but I never acted on it because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. Plus, he never seemed to see me in that way.\n\nAbout six months ago, Jake started dating ""Emily"" (F26). She’s sweet, kind, and honestly, perfect for him. They seem really happy together, and I should be happy for him, right? But instead, I’ve been feeling increasingly jealous and resentful. \n\nJake and I used to spend almost all our free time together, but now, understandably, he spends most of it with Emily. We still hang out, but it’s different. The spontaneity is gone, and everything needs to be scheduled. He no longer tells me things first; Emily does. This has left me feeling like I\'m losing my best friend.\n\nLast weekend, we were at a mutual friend’s party. I had a bit too much to drink and ended up confessing to Jake that I’ve always had feelings for him. I said I didn’t understand how he could just move on and forget about me. He was understandably shocked and said that he’s happy with Emily and that I need to respect that. The rest of the night was awkward, to say the least.\n\nSince that night, Jake has been distant. He hasn’t been returning my texts as quickly, and when we do talk, it’s very surface-level. Emily found out about my drunken confession and is understandably upset. She thinks I was trying to sabotage their relationship, and now Jake is in the middle, torn between his best friend and his girlfriend.\n\nMy other friends think I overstepped and that I shouldn’t have said anything. They believe I need to move on and let Jake be happy. But I can’t help feeling like I’ve been sidelined. I miss the closeness we once shared and feel like I’m losing a part of myself.\n\nI get that he’s in a relationship and boundaries change, but I can’t help feeling hurt. Am I the asshole for expecting my best friend to still want me in his life the way he used to, even though he’s moved on and is happy with someone else?'}]","{

When they tried to reclaim their account, their friend felt hurt and lashed out, accusing OP of being selfish. OP responded poorly, telling their friend to'search the account and use it' and being unapologetic and defensive.

Adhere to the Judgement:\nEnsure that the generated story logically leads to the required judgment (e.g., if the judgment is NTA, the story should clearly indicate why the poster might be considered not the asshole).\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: AITA for saying I won't spend holidays with my family anymore if my mom won't let my fiancee help her cook?""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I\'ve been with my fiancee ""Rosie"" for 4 years and we have always rotated holidays between our two families. In her family cooking is a big deal with all of the women in the kitchen (I know and have offered help, don\'t come for me) and they all take part and socialize while doing it.\n\nIn my family my mom does most of the cooking. My sisters might wander in and out and help, her husband might chop some vegetables, but it is really mainly her.

I talked to my mom again and she confided in me that she finds Rosie annoying and doesn\'t want to be forced to spend that much time with her, and it would ""ruin"" her holidays.

I had a Spotify account, but due to some financial issues, I had to cancel my subscription for a while. My best friend, ""Jake,"" offered to let me use his account during that time, and I was super grateful. We’ve always shared music and made playlists for each other, so it felt kind of natural.

Fast forward a few months, I finally got my financial situation sorted out and was able to re-subscribe to Spotify. I was really excited to have my own account again, and I spent a couple of hours customizing it and creating new playlists. When I logged in, I noticed that Jake’s playlists and some of his favorites were still kind of mixed in my library since I had been using his account for so long.

I shot Jake a text, jokingly saying that I wasn’t going to bother creating my own playlists because his were just too good. He responded with a laughing emoji and said I should definitely make my own because that’s the whole point of having my own account. I didn’t think much of it until I started sharing my playlists and music recommendations with him, but I felt like he wasn’t taking my suggestions seriously.

One day, I sent him a playlist I had curated specifically for a road trip we planned for the weekend. Instead of engaging with it, he brushed it off and said he’d just stick to his favorites. Feeling a bit hurt, I snapped and said something along the lines of, “Well, now that I have my own account, I guess you won’t be missing my taste in music anymore.” It was meant to be light-hearted, but I could tell it came across as rude. 

Jake didn’t take it well and said I was being a jerk after everything he did for me. I realized that my comment probably stung considering I had relied on him for so long. Our mutual friends overheard this exchange and pretty much agreed that I was out of line for my comment. They think I should have recognized how generous he was and appreciated his support instead of throwing it back in his face.

Now, I feel bad because I genuinely care about Jake and our friendship, but I also thought I was just joking. Am I the asshole here for being dismissive and a jerk to my best friend?","I've been dealing with a real headache lately involving my Spotify account. For a bit of context, my best friend ""Mark"" and I have shared pretty much everything since high school—games, accounts, you name it. We've always been super close, almost like brothers. 

Recently, my Spotify account got hacked, and I lost access to it for about two weeks. My playlists, saved songs, everything was gone, and I was pretty frustrated about it. I contacted Spotify support, and after some back-and-forth, they finally managed to get my account back. 

When I logged in, I noticed that some of my playlists had been messed with, songs were added and deleted, and the account name had been changed to something stupid. I was really pissed off and immediately assumed it had to be someone who got the info from my circle, given how secure I thought I'd kept it.

I vented to Mark about it, saying something like, ""This is why I hate sharing accounts or letting anyone know my login info. People just mess things up."" Mark got quiet and didn't say much, which was unusual for him. Later that night, I got a message from him saying he was the one who had accessed my account. He said he had noticed the hack and tried to fix things but then got busy and forgot to tell me he had made some changes. Apparently, he thought he was helping but didn’t want to admit it because he felt bad when things got messed up.

I lost my temper and sent him a series of harsh messages, calling him irresponsible and saying he should’ve just left it alone instead of making it worse. Mark apologized multiple times, but I was still too angry to let it go. I even told him that maybe we should stop sharing anything to avoid this kind of problem in the future.

Our mutual friends found out about the incident and told me I was being a massive jerk. They said that Mark was trying to help and that I overreacted. Mark has been distant since then, and our friendship feels strained now. 

I realize I may have overreacted, but I felt so violated and upset in the moment. Now I'm wondering if I took it too far and if I should have handled it differently. So, am I the asshole for being a jerk to my best friend after I got my Spotify account back?","My best friend and I have been close since high school. We've always shared our music tastes and have a similar sense of humor. We even started a joint Spotify playlist a few years ago where we'd add songs and comment on each other's choices.

Fast forward to last year, I lost access to my Spotify account due to a billing issue. I tried to resolve it but ended up getting locked out of the account for a few months. My friend, being the good friend that she is, kept trying to help me get back into the account and even offered to give me access to her account temporarily.

Finally, after a few months, I was able to get my account back. However, when I went to log in, I found out that my friend had deleted the joint playlist we had created together. I was pretty upset about it, not just because it was a big part of our friendship, but also because she had told me she was going to keep it going while I was locked out.

When I confronted her about it, she apologized and said she had gotten tired of seeing the same songs over and over again and thought it was a good opportunity to refresh the playlist. I told her that wasn't the point, the point was that she had promised to keep it going and now it was gone.

To be honest, I was pretty angry and said some hurtful things to her. I told her that she wasn't a good friend and that she had broken our trust. I even went as far as saying that I didn't know why I was still friends with her. She got pretty defensive and we haven't spoken since.

I know I overreacted and said some things I shouldn't have, but I still feel like she was wrong for deleting the playlist without asking me first.

68,AITA for telling my kids babysitter that it was inappropriate of her to shower in my home?,"  I hired a babysitter for my 5 and 3 year old kids 2 weeks ago. My husband works shifts while I work long hours at a marketing company.   So far we've had no issues til yesterday. I came home at 6pm and noticed the babysitter's wet hair and new clothes. She told me she took a shower after one of the kids spilled milk on her. I was confused but visibly upset but she tried to ""reassure"" me the kids were fine, because my husband watched them while she took her shower which only lasted for few minutes. I was more confused that my husband was home when he had a shift to cover. I told her I didn't think it was appropriate of her to shower in my home like that. She argued that it was fine and that she had no choice and couldn't leave the milk on her like that. We argued and my husband heard the commotion and got involved. He said it was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be but I told the babysitter that I did not appreciate how she basically ignored how I felt about this and dismissed my feelings still. She went home, but we still argued on the phone. She thinks she's done nothing wrong and said I was being unfair when I mentioned potentially cutting from her salary after that.   My husband keeps saying that I'm overreacting and the ""poor girl"" couldn't handle having milk stains on her body and clothes. But I couldn't help feel it was inappropriate and she shouldve checked with me.    AITA for my reaction? Just for info. I'm the one who pays her, not my husband. I told her to call or text (always available) if anything happens. I didn't even know my husband was home at the time! If you noticed, I said that I argued with her even before she told me my husband was home. And no I didn't know how big the stain was but she argued about being covered in milk for 6+hrs. As for the question of why my husband didn't go to work? He said he was feeling a bit sick and swapped shifts with a coworker.   The babysitter is 24. She said she has experience and yes she normally brings a bag of clothes, wet wipes and stuff like that with her.",YTA,"Judgement: YTA, Post:   I hired a babysitter for my 5 and 3 year old kids 2 weeks ago.

We\'ve been wanting to get a second beagle for a few months now. We found a five month old beagle for sale online. The ad said the owners were moving back to their home country so had to re-home him.

Their son lives with them and will be staying here but he works 12 hour days so they decided it would be best to give up their dog (Leo) as they didn\'t want him to be alone that much.

Recently, we hired a babysitter, Sarah, to watch him while my husband and I went out for a date night. We had gotten good recommendations, and I was really hopeful it would go smoothly.

Everything was going fine until I got a text from Sarah while we were out. She said that my son had accidentally spilled milk all over her. She handled it well and even sent me a photo of him looking apologetic, which I thought was cute. But then, she told me she was going to take a shower to clean up.

When we got home about an hour later, I walked in to find Sarah still in the shower, and my son was in the living room just watching TV. At first, I was relieved to find that he wasn’t upset or hurt, but then I felt really uncomfortable that Sarah was showering instead of keeping an eye on him. I mean, he’s three! He could easily get into something or hurt himself. 

I knocked on the bathroom door and asked how much longer she would be. When she replied she needed a few more minutes to rinse off, I lost my temper and yelled at her, saying it was irresponsible to leave my child unsupervised like that. I told her that it was unprofessional and that she should have waited until after she made sure he was settled and safe. 

She came out looking a bit shaken and apologized, but she also defended herself by saying that the spill was a lot and she wanted to clean herself up since it was all over her clothes. We ended the night with a weird vibe, and I could tell she was upset when she left. 

Now I’m feeling conflicted. Was I right to expect her to prioritize my son’s safety over cleaning herself up? Or did I overreact and make her feel bad for something that was an accident? My friends are divided on the matter, with some saying I was justified because my child's safety comes first, while others think I was harsh and should have been more understanding. 

So, AITA for yelling at the babysitter for taking a shower after my kid accidentally spilled milk on her?","I (32F) am a single mom to my 5-year-old son, Max. Like many parents, I rely on babysitters occasionally to help out when I need to work late or run errands. Last week, I had an important meeting that ran late, so I hired a new babysitter, Claire (19F), who came highly recommended by a friend.

When I came home, I found Max playing in the living room, but I couldn’t find Claire. I asked Max where she was, and he told me she was in the bathroom. I knocked on the door and she told me she was taking a quick shower because Max had accidentally spilled milk all over her. She said she didn't want to sit in soggy clothes for the rest of the time.

I was immediately frustrated. I didn't understand why she couldn't just change into spare clothes or deal with it until I got home. I yelled at her, saying it was unprofessional to leave a child unattended, even for a short time, to take a shower in someone else's house without permission. Claire apologized, saying she made sure Max was in a safe place with his toys and could hear him the whole time. But I was still upset and told her I wouldn't be needing her services anymore.

I discussed it with my friends and family, and they've been split. Some think I overreacted, saying a quick shower in an emergency isn’t a big deal and that she was thinking of her comfort and hygiene. Others agree with me, saying it was inappropriate and she should have handled the situation differently.

Since then, I've been feeling conflicted, especially after seeing how well Max got along with Claire. She was really good with him, and now I'm wondering if I was too harsh. But at the same time, I feel like she should have put Max’s supervision first. 

So, am I the asshole for yelling at the babysitter for taking a shower after my kid accidentally spilled milk on her?","I've been watching my niece for a few weeks now. It's been a blast, but also super stressful. Today was one of those days. I was in the middle of making lunch and my niece spilled an entire carton of milk all over the babysitter, Emily. It was a huge mess. Emily is a great sitter and handled it like a pro, but she had to change her clothes and wash her hair because it got all covered in milk. I'm talking a huge mess, like a crime scene. 

I was still in the middle of cleaning up the kitchen, but I saw Emily head to the shower to clean up. I was already stressed out and my niece was still being a handful, so I lost my cool. I yelled at Emily for taking a shower without asking me first. I told her that she was being selfish and that she should have waited until I said it was okay. I was pretty harsh, and I could tell Emily was taken aback.

My sister, who is my niece's mom, was called and she said I was being completely unreasonable. She told me that Emily was just trying to clean herself up after a huge mess and that it wasn't a big deal. But I still feel like I was right to be upset. I mean, what if Emily had gotten hurt or something? What if she had slipped on the milk and fallen? I just couldn't shake the thought that she was being reckless and not thinking about anyone else but herself.

Emily came out of the shower and said she was going to go home and that she didn't feel comfortable staying after our argument. I felt bad, but I also felt like she overreacted. I mean, it was just a shower. My sister told me that I was being an asshole and that I should have apologized to Emily right away. But I'm still not convinced.

He was always supportive and we spent a lot of time together, but he also had very clear expectations about responsibility and accountability. Recently, though, things took a turn.

Last month, I was home from college and decided to have a few friends over. We got a little rowdy, indulged in some drinks, and at some point, someone suggested a game of indoor frisbee. It was a terrible idea, but being in the moment and not thinking straight, I agreed. You can probably guess what happened next: the frisbee went flying and crashed into one of the support beams in my dad's garage. It created a noticeable dent and some damage to the structure. 

The next morning, I was horrified when my dad walked in and saw the damage. He was understandably furious. We ended up having a long talk about responsibility, and he made it clear that it was my fault and that I needed to own up to my actions. I felt awful, but honestly, I also thought about how my dad's garage has been a little old and needed some repairs anyway. 

So, here's where I might be the asshole: when my dad mentioned fixing the garage, I suggested that since I caused the damage, I shouldn't have to pay for it—he should just cover the costs, since it's his garage and it's been needing work for a while. I honestly thought he would agree that it makes sense for him to pay for it, but he exploded, saying that I need to take responsibility for my actions and that unless I want to pay for the repairs, I’d better step up.

I talked to a few friends about it, and they were divided. Some said I should definitely help pay for the repairs since I was the one who caused the damage, while others thought my dad was being unreasonable. 

Now I'm left wondering if I'm really the asshole for expecting my dad to just cover the costs after I messed up?","I (22m) recently moved back in with my dad (50m) after finishing college. My dad has a really nice garage that he keeps impeccably clean and organized. He uses it not only for parking his car but also as a workshop for his woodworking hobby. All of his tools are neatly stored, and he takes a lot of pride in that space.

Last week, while I was attempting to back my car out of the garage, I misjudged the distance and ended up scraping the side of his car and knocking over a shelf with some of his tools. The damage to his car and the garage itself was pretty significant—there were scratches and dents on the car, the shelf was broken, and a few of his expensive tools were damaged.

When my dad saw what happened, he was understandably upset but didn't get angry. He calmly asked me what happened and then said we’d talk about it later. I assumed since it was an accident and because he’s my dad, he’d take care of fixing everything. I figured he had insurance that would cover it, and as I’m currently job hunting, I don’t have much money to spare.

However, when we sat down to talk, he told me I needed to pay for the damages. He wasn't asking for the whole amount upfront but wanted me to set up a payment plan to cover the costs over time. I was taken aback and honestly a bit hurt. I argued that since it was his garage and I’m his son, he should cover the damage. I felt he should be more understanding given my financial situation.

He said he understood it was an accident but emphasized that taking responsibility for my actions was important. My dad has always been big on teaching life lessons, but this felt harsh to me, especially since I’m trying to get on my feet after college.

I mentioned this situation to a few friends, and their reactions were mixed. Some agreed with me, thinking parents should help their kids out unconditionally, while others sided with my dad, saying it’s a good lesson in responsibility.

Now there's a noticeable tension between us, and I’m wondering if I might be the asshole here. Shouldn’t my dad, as a parent, be more lenient and financially supportive, especially since it wasn’t intentional? Am I the asshole for expecting my dad to pay for the damage I caused to his garage?","My dad and I have always been close, but we've had our share of disagreements over the years. A few months ago, we were having a huge argument about me wanting to move back in with him after college. He said he wasn't comfortable with me coming back, but I felt like I had no other options. Things escalated, and in the heat of the moment, I accidentally smashed his garage door with his golf cart.

He was furious and rightfully so. I apologized and offered to pay for the repairs, but I didn't know how much it would cost. He told me to take care of it myself and that I'd have to figure it out. Fast forward to a few weeks later, and I finally got around to getting a quote for the repairs. It ended up being around $2,500, which I know is a lot, but it's also my fault.

However, when I brought it up with my dad again, he said that I shouldn't have expected him to pay for it at all. He said I should have been more careful and that it was my responsibility to fix it. I understand where he's coming from, but I feel like he should at least contribute something since it was his garage door that got damaged.

I've been trying to talk to him about it, but he's not budging. He's always been a bit frugal, but I feel like this is a bit unfair. I've been living with him rent-free for a while now, and I feel like he should be willing to help me out a bit.

All of his tools are neatly stored, and he takes a lot of pride in that space.\n\nLast week, while I was attempting to back my car out of the garage, I misjudged the distance and ended up scraping the side of his car and knocking over a shelf with some of his tools. The damage to his car and the garage itself was pretty significant—there were scratches and dents on the car, the shelf was broken, and a few of his expensive tools were damaged.\n\nWhen my dad saw what happened, he was understandably upset but didn't get angry. He calmly asked me what happened and then said we’d talk about it later. I assumed since it was an accident and because he’s my dad, he’d take care of fixing everything. I figured he had insurance that would cover it, and as I’m currently job hunting, I don’t have much money to spare.\n\nHowever, when we sat down to talk, he told me I needed to pay for the damages. He wasn't asking for the whole amount upfront but wanted me to set up a payment plan to cover the costs over time. I was taken aback and honestly a bit hurt. I argued that since it was his garage and I’m his son, he should cover the damage. I felt he should be more understanding given my financial situation.\n\nHe said he understood it was an accident but emphasized that taking responsibility for my actions was important. My dad has always been big on teaching life lessons, but this felt harsh to me, especially since I’m trying to get on my feet after college.\n\nI mentioned this situation to a few friends, and their reactions were mixed. Some agreed with me, thinking parents should help their kids out unconditionally, while others sided with my dad, saying it’s a good lesson in responsibility.\n\nNow there's a noticeable tension between us, and I’m wondering if I might be the asshole here. Shouldn’t my dad, as a parent, be more lenient and financially supportive, especially since it wasn’t intentional? Am I the asshole for expecting my dad to pay for the damage I caused to his garage?""}]","{

It's important to note here that I've only ever invited over other women, and he's only ever invited over other men. Our guests also stay in our own bedrooms.\n\n\nThree weeks ago, one of my friends, Mike (22M) needed a place to stay for three days because he was leaving an abusive partner. I asked my roommate if it was alright to have him over for those three days. I explained the sensitivity of the situation and I promised, as always, to cover any extra expenses caused by Mike being over. My roommate refused because he said he didn't feel comfortable with a man being invited over. I had no clue what he was talking about it and I was very annoyed, but I respected his choice. My friends and I put money together to get Mike a hotel room for those three days instead. \n\n\nToday, my roommate asked if he could have two friends over for Friday and the Weekend. I said no because it was against the renters rules. He was confused because we've both agreed to break the rules before, but I said to him that I didn't feel comfortable with two strange men over. He could tell straight away that I was doing it to annoy him because he didn't let Mike stay over, plus I have met the friends he was inviting over before. He told me to stop being childish because he has a right to refuse guests for being uncomfortable whereas I was doing it to be annoying. What's even more irritating is that he has met Mike before and they get along with eachother. He then said he'd invite them over anyway but I said I'd call the landlord if he did so. We got into an argument and he called me an asshole for threatening to call the landlord over this. I still don't think I'm wrong because I am allowed (in the agreement) to refuse guests for any reason but i would like an objective opinion. AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: ESH, Title: AITA for Refusing to Acknowledge My Snoring as a Problem for My Partner's Sleep?""}]","I (28F) have been in a relationship with my partner (30M) for the past year. Overall, we get along really well, and have similar lifestyles and interests. However, there's one issue that's been causing tension between us lately: my snoring.

I’ve always snored, but it never seemed to be a major problem until my partner moved in with me. He’s mentioned it a few times, saying it disrupts his sleep and makes it difficult for him to fall asleep at night. I get that, but I also feel like it’s just part of who I am. I’ve tried to brush it off as something he needs to adjust to. He even suggested I see a doctor, but I’m not keen on going through tests or treatments for something I see as normal.

Last week, I went to bed after having a long day, feeling exhausted. My partner came in a bit later, and as usual, when I fell asleep, I started snoring. Upon waking up the next morning, he was annoyed and said he barely slept. He brought it up again, asking me to consider using nasal strips or trying to change my sleeping position. I replied that I find it ridiculous that I have to change my behavior for something I can't really control. I mean, people snore, right?

This led to a bigger argument where he accused me of not caring about his sleep and well-being. I felt defensive and told him that he needs to find a solution if it really bothers him—like using earplugs or sleeping in another room. It escalated from there, and I ended up saying a few hurtful things about how he’s being dramatic over something that is a common issue for many people.

Now, our relationship feels a bit strained. He thinks I’m not taking his concerns seriously, and I think he’s overreacting. Friends have mixed opinions; some say I should be more considerate, while others believe he should adjust to my quirks in a relationship. It’s left me second-guessing whether I’m the one being insensitive.

So, AITA for refusing to acknowledge my snoring as a problem for my partner's sleep?","I (26F) have been with my partner (28M), Alex, for three years, and we've lived together for the past year. Things have generally been great between us, except for one recurring issue: my snoring. According to Alex, I snore so loudly that it wakes him up multiple times a night. He says it's affecting his sleep and, as a result, his mood and overall well-being.

At first, I thought it was just an occasional thing, maybe due to a cold or being overly tired. But Alex insists it's a nightly occurrence. He started off by gently nudging me to turn on my side, which worked temporarily. However, it didn’t take long for the snoring to resume, and Alex would be left irritated and sleep-deprived. 

A couple of months ago, Alex began suggesting various remedies: nasal strips, special pillows, and even a visit to a sleep specialist. I brushed off most of his suggestions, figuring it was just an overreaction. To be honest, I found it hard to believe that my snoring could be causing such a big issue. After all, I was sleeping just fine.

Matters came to a head last week when Alex, exhausted and frustrated, asked if we could sleep in separate beds. I took it as an exaggeration—his way of guilt-tripping me into taking his complaints more seriously. We had a heated argument where I accused him of making a mountain out of a molehill. He retaliated by saying I was being inconsiderate and dismissive of his needs. In my defense, I argued that he was blowing the situation way out of proportion. 

Our friends are divided on this issue. Some think Alex is justified in his complaints and believe I should at least give his suggestions a try. Others feel he's making too much of a fuss and that snoring is a common issue couples deal with. My family thinks Alex should just get used to it and maybe invest in earplugs.

Since then, Alex has been visibly more stressed and our relationship feels strained. We’re now in this awkward limbo where neither of us wants to budge. I realize my reaction hasn’t been the most accommodating, but I also feel like Alex is being overly dramatic.

Given the tension it’s caused, am I the asshole for refusing to acknowledge my snoring as a problem for my partner's sleep?","I've been in a relationship with my partner (28M) for three years. We live together in a cozy little apartment and everything has been great until recently. One of the things my partner has been complaining about is my snoring. At first, I thought it was no big deal, but as it kept happening every night, it started to get annoying for him. 

He's tried to get me to see the issue from his side by explaining how hard it is for him to sleep when I'm snoring, but I just brush it off. I tell him it's not that bad and that he's being too sensitive. I've even gone so far as to tell him that he's just being selfish for expecting me to change something that doesn't bother me. 

The thing is, I'm not just being a jerk about it. I genuinely don't hear my own snoring. I've tried recording myself at night and I don't make a peep, but my partner swears it's really loud. He's asked me to try to sleep on my side or to use earplugs, but I refuse. I don't see why I should have to change my sleeping position or wear earplugs just because he can't sleep.

The argument that usually ensues is that he's being unreasonable for expecting me to change my behavior and that I'm being insensitive for not listening to his concerns. I, on the other hand, think he's being too uptight and that I'm being reasonable for not making any changes. 

This has been going on for months now and it's starting to cause some tension in our relationship. I feel like I'm being attacked for something that I don't think is a problem. I think my partner is being unreasonable for expecting me to change something that doesn't bother me. 

So, I guess my question is, am I the asshole for refusing to acknowledge my snoring as a problem for my partner's sleep?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""I (26F) have been with my partner (28M), Alex, for three years, and we've lived together for the past year.

71,AITA For wanting to take in a cat when my roommate doesn’t want one,"To give some backstory, my girlfriend and her family had two cats. A couple of years ago, a family friend of hers essentially kidnapped the cat and kept it in their house. Fast forward to now, the cat is no longer allowed in said family friends house and my girlfriends family won’t take it back in. My girlfriend and I thought about taking the cat to my place. I live in a very large bedroom that has its own washroom (The bedroom is the size of a large living room). I live with three other people and the other two have agreed to take in the cat. However, one of my roommates does not want the cat. He doesn’t like cats, doesn’t want it running around the house, and doesn’t want hair everywhere. I tried explaining to him that the cat would be in my room and it would be as if there was no cat in the house. He was initially upset about it, but later reluctantly agreed to taking in the cat for a week. If the cat was around the house too much, I would give it back. I understand where he’s coming from and I don’t know how to feel about the situation. I feel like it’s worth noting that he is not allergic to cats.

She hasn't told us why they broke up. Anyway, my other daughter Tory (F23) is coming home for the weekend from her college city, as it's her birthday.

Thus, we cherish it whenever the family gets together.\n\nHowever, Shiela said that she wasn't feeling up for the birthday dinner due to her being depressed over the breakup. She also said she's gonna need a long time to recover, and that Tory already said she was fine with Shiela skipping the dinner to recover. I told Shiela I'm doing my best to be empathetic, but we all don't get to see Tory often. I said I understood the breakup was painful, but she wasn't ever gonna feel better until she eventually got out of bed. If anything, I said seeing her sister again could probably put her in a better mood. Shiela said again that Tory was fine with it, and Carly mentioned that she could've been lying to avoid hurting Shiela. Shiela lashed out and accused us both of being selfish. I said that we could talk about this in a civil manner, but Shiela told me the breakup was still fresh and needed to mourn the last two years of love.

AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Bringing a Cat into Our Shared House Despite One Roommate's Explicit Discomfort?'""}]","Last week, I (M26) made the decision to adopt a cat. I’ve always wanted a pet, and when I saw this sweet little tabby at the shelter, I couldn’t resist bringing him home. The only problem? One of my roommates, Lisa (F25), is extremely uncomfortable around cats. When I first moved in with Lisa and our other roommate, Dave (M27), I had mentioned wanting a pet. Lisa was clear then that she had a bad experience with cats as a child and would rather not have one in the house at all. I understood her concerns and assured her I wouldn’t get a cat if it bothered her.

However, after living together for a few months and getting to know Dave, who is a huge cat lover, I felt more confident that we could manage the situation. Dave was all for the idea and even offered to help me train and care for the cat. I thought maybe having the cat around could help Lisa overcome her discomfort, as she often says she would like to like them. 

So, I brought the cat home without any further discussion with Lisa. At first, she was taken aback and made it clear she was unhappy about the situation. I tried to reassure her that I would keep the cat in my room, use a litter box that would be cleaned regularly, and minimize any interactions between them. I thought that allowing Lisa to see that my cat was well-behaved would ease her discomfort over time.

However, it escalated quickly. Lisa became visibly anxious, and one night, I found her up late, apparently crying in the living room because of the cat. I felt bad, and I tried to talk it out with her, but she just told me it was disrespectful of me to get a pet without considering her feelings. Dave echoed her sentiments, saying that while he loves the cat, it’s important to respect our roommate's boundaries.

In the days since, Lisa has been distant and has even started spending more time at her friend’s place to avoid being around the cat. I can see that my decision really affected the atmosphere in our shared home. I thought I could bring a little joy into my life, but now I’m left wondering if I should’ve considered Lisa’s comfort more seriously before deciding to adopt the pet.

So, AITA for bringing a cat into our shared house despite one roommate's explicit discomfort?","So, a couple of months ago, I (F24) moved into a shared house with three other roommates: Jake (M26), Sarah (F25), and Emma (F23). We all got along pretty well, and things were generally smooth. Recently, though, I adopted a cat named Whiskers. I've always loved cats and finally felt ready to have one of my own. When I first mentioned the idea of getting a cat, almost everyone seemed okay with it – except Emma.

Emma told me she had a serious discomfort around cats. She didn't go into specifics, but she was firm about not wanting one in the house. I thought about it for a while and figured Emma would eventually get used to Whiskers. I mean, lots of people say they don't like cats until they actually live with one, right?

So, one day, while Emma was out, I brought Whiskers home. Jake and Sarah were both there and seemed excited about the new addition. When Emma got home and saw the cat, she looked visibly uncomfortable and went straight to her room. Later that evening, she confronted me, saying she thought I was being incredibly selfish, especially after she had been clear about her feelings.

Jake and Sarah are trying to stay out of it, but they did tell me privately that they think Emma is overreacting. They said the house should be a comfortable place for everyone, and Whiskers isn't hurting anyone. I tried to justify it to Emma by saying that Whiskers brings me a lot of joy and that it would benefit the household overall – you know, for stress relief and companionship.

Things have been tense ever since. Emma avoids common areas and barely speaks to me. Every time I try to engage her in a conversation about Whiskers, she shuts it down or leaves the room. It’s starting to affect the overall vibe in the house.

Did I overstep by bringing Whiskers in despite Emma's discomfort? Am I the asshole for not taking her feelings into account?","My partner (28m) and I (25f) have been sharing a two-bedroom house for about a year now. We both work from home and value having a pet, so when my partner brought home his cat, Luna (who I've grown to adore), I was more than happy to have her join our household. Luna was previously living with my partner in his one-bedroom apartment and he had grown very attached to her. 

However, my roommate, Alex (27m), had explicitly expressed discomfort with cats in the past. He's never been an animal lover and has a history of having severe allergies. This was something that we both knew about and discussed before moving in together. In fact, it was a condition of Alex joining our household that we wouldn't get any pets. My partner and I agreed to this and even signed a roommate agreement that included a no-pet clause.

Fast forward a few months, and my partner had developed strong feelings for Luna. I could see how much he loved her, and I wanted to support him in having a pet. So, I started secretly feeding Luna treats and showering her with attention whenever my partner was out. Meanwhile, my partner was casually dropping hints to me about how much he wanted to adopt Luna and make her a permanent part of our household.

When I finally brought it up with Alex, he was understandably upset. He felt betrayed that we had broken the no-pet agreement and that his allergies were being disregarded. He asked us to get rid of Luna, but my partner and I were both against it. We argued that Luna was a part of our family and that Alex could just take steps to minimize his exposure to her.

The situation has been tense ever since. Alex is constantly finding excuses to stay out of the house or to go to his room, claiming that Luna's presence is triggering his allergies. My partner and I feel like we're being unreasonable and that Alex is being overly dramatic. But at the same time, I can see how much this is affecting Alex and I feel guilty for bringing Luna into the house despite knowing his concerns.

72,AITA for asking my boyfriend to let me know when he leaves our vacation rental?,"My boyfriend (39) and I (24F) were on a vacation to a mountaintop resort, because I have never seen the ‘leaf’ season and was excited to see everything on our two-night trip.  After arriving late af (3am) due to a number of factors, we stayed up until 5am. Even though I worked 7 hours and my boyfriend was off, I drove his new Tesla (a car I am less confident driving than my car) so I’m exhausted.  We decided at 5am to go to bed until around 7am, so that we could see the sunrise from the balcony, and then sleep in. We get in bed and he pulls out a book while I fall asleep. I am a deep sleeper while my boyfriend is not.  At 7am I am awoken to see the sunrise, it is gorgeous and while I am normally grumpy upon waking up, I thank my boyfriend for waking me before going back to bed.  At 9:30am I wake up alone, and call his name. Hearing no answer, I call out again. Call it anxiety or trust issues (he is still in the process of earning my trust back, not because of explicit cheating but because of old messaging with my coworker, and my ex left me with trust issues that I have {proudly} 80% overcome, set back by my boyfriend’s actions with others) my mind begins to panic.  I get out of bed, walk into the doorway of the living room and am hit by the volume of the vent fan (a noise he uses to sleep). I shout his name, before seeing him sit up from the couch in the living room. (He apparently never really went to sleep once I did at 5am, he woke me up at 7am and then did work stuff on his laptop until I woke up.)  He is instantly mad at me for yelling at him, and in my panicked, just-woke-up stupor (did I mention I CAN be an admitted bitch for 5-10 minutes after I wake up), I mirrored his anger and yelled that I was just worried about where he was. He, as a 39-year-old, private-schooled, only-child man, doesn’t like to be told what to do. So he countered with something along the lines of, “so what if I had gone to get coffee for us? Or breakfast? Would you be mad then?”   Honestly, yes. Because  A. He left me in a condo complex while he took our only car, and  B. He would’ve driven down the mountain, with spectacular views that I had driven through the night before and couldn’t look at (I could tell by the sky and the lights of houses that the view was pretty damn nice but I was driving up a curvy mountain and it was 3am) without me, while he “let me sleep*”  *I am relatively easy to wake up, and I told him that all he could’ve woken me and told me he was leaving, and then if I chose to sleep I would do so in peace.

We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like “your mom” jokes, “you suck at this”, “you’re not very smart”, “how dare you” and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :\n\n“i have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.”\n\nI was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I didn’t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger’s, and things that don’t normally both others can bother her.)\n\nI guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me. I often mimic people’s personality and humor to fit with them, so after we had been friends for so long we were practically the same person. everyone said that, even our moms.

We chose a beautiful beach destination and were looking forward to spending quality time together. We were excited and had a packed itinerary with all sorts of fun activities. However, things took a turn when we arrived at the hotel.

On our first morning there, I woke up a little later than him and he decided to head to a nearby coffee shop because he was craving a special coffee that he had heard about. At first, I was okay with it—after all, everyone has their own morning routines. But when I got myself ready and texted him to meet up, he told me he was already at the coffee shop and was planning to stay there a while longer to enjoy his drink and some pastries. 

I thought, “Okay, just a quick pit stop,” but then I waited...and waited. Hours passed, and he never returned. I was starting to feel abandoned, especially since we had planned to spend our mornings together. Instead of enjoying the beach, I felt anxious and frustrated that he was off alone while I was left behind. So, I decided to go to the coffee shop to find him. 

When I got there, I saw him sitting outside with a few other tourists, chatting and laughing. I felt a wave of emotion hit me. I confronted him right there, saying how he had totally ditched me. I couldn’t hold back my feelings, and I ended up freaking out at him about how inconsiderate it was to leave me there alone, especially on a vacation we planned together. I felt like he was prioritizing his coffee over our time together.

After that, he seemed taken aback and apologized but also said I was overreacting. Later, he told me that I should have been more understanding since he just wanted to grab coffee and enjoy the moment. He tried to explain that it wasn't a big deal to him, but to me, it felt like a huge deal. 

My friends have mixed opinions. Some say I was justified because vacations are about spending time together, while others think I should have let him enjoy his time. He and I have had a few heated discussions since then about how we communicate and what we expect from each other on vacation.

Now, I can’t help but question myself. Was I the asshole for freaking out over what may seem like a small thing?","My boyfriend (M 27) and I (F 26) recently went on our first big vacation together. We were both really excited because it was our first trip abroad, and we had meticulously planned every single day. Both of us are big planners, and we had a full itinerary to make the most out of our trip.

On the third day of our vacation, we had a scheduled early morning tour. We had to be at the meeting point by 7:00 AM, and we stayed up late the night before because we got lost while wandering around the city. I struggle with mornings, and while my boyfriend is an early riser, I need a bit more time to wake up and get ready.

That morning, my alarm didn’t go off, and he woke me up around 6:30 AM because I was still asleep. I rushed to get dressed and barely had time to brush my teeth before we had to leave. Seeing how rushed and groggy I was, he suggested that he go out to get us some coffee from a nearby café while I finished getting ready. I agreed, thinking it would be a nice gesture and a great way to wake up fully.

After he left, I hurried to finish up, but when I was finally ready and waiting for him, he was nowhere to be found. I started to get anxious as time was ticking, and I called him multiple times with no answer. By 6:55 AM, I was freaking out. I decided to go to the café he had mentioned, but by the time I got there, he wasn’t there either. I was panicking and frustrated because our tour was about to start. 

Finally, at 7:10 AM, he showed up with two cups of coffee in hand, looking completely relaxed. I was livid. I started yelling at him in the middle of the street about how irresponsible he was for leaving me behind and not answering his phone. He tried to explain that the café had a long line, and he lost track of time, but I was too angry to listen. My outburst caused a scene, and I stormed off back to our hotel, skipping the tour altogether.

Later, he told me he felt I overreacted and made a big deal out of nothing, and that it wasn't fair to ruin the day over a cup of coffee. Our friends back home are divided. Some say I was justified in being upset since we had plans, while others think I was too harsh and should have been more understanding.

Looking back, maybe I overreacted, but I felt completely abandoned and stressed out in a foreign city. So, AITA for freaking out when my boyfriend left me behind for coffee on vacation?","My boyfriend of two years, Alex (25M), and I (23F) were on a dream vacation in Hawaii. We had been planning this trip for months and were excited to spend quality time together, just the two of us. We had a packed itinerary, but also made sure to leave some free time for relaxation and spontaneity.

On the second day of our trip, Alex woke up early and told me that he was craving a cup of coffee from a local café that was a 10-minute walk from our hotel. He asked if I wanted to come with him, but I was still in bed, enjoying the extra sleep. I told him I'd meet him there in a bit, as I wanted to get some rest and then join him for coffee.

However, Alex decided to go ahead and get the coffee by himself, without even checking if I was awake or not. When I finally woke up and got dressed, I was shocked to find that he had already left, and I was left alone in the hotel room. I felt abandoned and furious that he would just leave me behind like that, especially when we were on vacation together.

I quickly got dressed and rushed to the café, where I found Alex sipping on his coffee and chatting with the barista. He looked up and saw me coming, and his expression changed from relaxed to annoyed. He told me that he had only been gone for 20 minutes and that I was overreacting. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that he had prioritized his coffee over our time together.

The rest of the day was awkward, and we barely spoke to each other. Alex kept saying that I was being too sensitive, but I felt like he had disrespected me and our relationship. We ended up going our separate ways for the rest of the day, and I spent the evening in tears.

When we got back to our hotel room, Alex apologized for leaving me behind, but I could tell he was still not taking my feelings seriously. He said that I should have communicated better and let him know that I was still sleeping.

We were both really excited because it was our first trip abroad, and we had meticulously planned every single day. Both of us are big planners, and we had a full itinerary to make the most out of our trip.\n\nOn the third day of our vacation, we had a scheduled early morning tour. We had to be at the meeting point by 7:00 AM, and we stayed up late the night before because we got lost while wandering around the city. I struggle with mornings, and while my boyfriend is an early riser, I need a bit more time to wake up and get ready.\n\nThat morning, my alarm didn’t go off, and he woke me up around 6:30 AM because I was still asleep. I rushed to get dressed and barely had time to brush my teeth before we had to leave. Seeing how rushed and groggy I was, he suggested that he go out to get us some coffee from a nearby café while I finished getting ready. I agreed, thinking it would be a nice gesture and a great way to wake up fully.\n\nAfter he left, I hurried to finish up, but when I was finally ready and waiting for him, he was nowhere to be found. I started to get anxious as time was ticking, and I called him multiple times with no answer. By 6:55 AM, I was freaking out. I decided to go to the café he had mentioned, but by the time I got there, he wasn’t there either. I was panicking and frustrated because our tour was about to start. \n\nFinally, at 7:10 AM, he showed up with two cups of coffee in hand, looking completely relaxed. I was livid. I started yelling at him in the middle of the street about how irresponsible he was for leaving me behind and not answering his phone. He tried to explain that the café had a long line, and he lost track of time, but I was too angry to listen. My outburst caused a scene, and I stormed off back to our hotel, skipping the tour altogether.\n\nLater, he told me he felt I overreacted and made a big deal out of nothing, and that it wasn't fair to ruin the day over a cup of coffee. Our friends back home are divided. Some say I was justified in being upset since we had plans, while others think I was too harsh and should have been more understanding.\n\nLooking back, maybe I overreacted, but I felt completely abandoned and stressed out in a foreign city. So, AITA for freaking out when my boyfriend left me behind for coffee on vacation?""}]","{

73,AITA For Not Paying Rent when being denied basic comforts?,"I have lived with my (ex) friend for 5 years now.  I was staying at the salvation army and she opened up her guest room to me for a few hundred a month.  This was supposed to be a month or so long arrangement but life got hectic.  This house has two bathrooms.  One is completely functional and modern.  The other one is not functional and needs remodeled.  I mean, the shower and toilet don't even work.  The sink works but no one ever uses it.  My former friend, I will call her FF, owns the house.  She has been saying for years she is trying to save the money to fix everything in that bathroom and it hasn't gotten done yet.  So last year I stopped paying rent except for when she hounds me about it and then I give her a little money to shut her up.  I'm sick of living in this house where I can't take a bath and have only a standup shower and don't have my own bathroom.  In the last 12 months she has gotten 3 tattoos and she went on a cross country road trip with her brother.  When I call her out on this stuff she just makes excuses like, ""It's gonna cost about 3 grand to do that bathroom.  I'm trying to save up the money but there are other bills and stuff that are just a higher priority.""  She has about $500 in the bathroom fund right now.  Yesterday she even had the audacity to blame me and say maybe if I paid rent she would have more money for the bathroom remodel.  She said I make more money than she does and it's ridiculous that she's supporting me.  She also sent some sappy text about how this is really hurting her a lot because 20 years of friendship are basically ruined and all she did was try to help me.  Whatever.  Well I think it's ridiculous that I can't even take a bubble bath while paying to live here but she can get tats and go on cross country trips.  Over the summer she told me she couldn't afford to turn the AC on either unless I start contributing more.  She said the AC raises the electric bill by $50 a month and she needs me to help if I want it on.   I'm sick of being denied basic comforts while she can get tats and go on trips. Oh and as of today (Halloween) she is posting all over social media about going to work at some big tattoo convention in 2023 and possibly going to Germany with her SO who is from there.  SMH...  Just wow.    So am I the asshole?   If anyone is wondering I am 40 and she is 43.

This house has two bathrooms.  One is completely functional and modern.  The other one is not functional and needs remodeled.  I mean, the shower and toilet don\'t even work.  The sink works but no one ever uses it.  My former friend, I will call her FF, owns the house.  She has been saying for years she is trying to save the money to fix everything in that bathroom and it hasn\'t gotten done yet.  So last year I stopped paying rent except for when she hounds me about it and then I give her a little money to shut her up.  I\'m sick of living in this house where I can\'t take a bath and have only a standup shower and don\'t have my own bathroom.  In the last 12 months she has gotten 3 tattoos and she went on a cross country road trip with her brother.  When I call her out on this stuff she just makes excuses like, ""It\'s gonna cost about 3 grand to do that bathroom.  I\'m trying to save up the money but there are other bills and stuff that are just a higher priority.""  She has about $500 in the bathroom fund right now.  Yesterday she even had the audacity to blame me and say maybe if I paid rent she would have more money for the bathroom remodel.  She said I make more money than she does and it\'s ridiculous that she\'s supporting me.  She also sent some sappy text about how this is really hurting her a lot because 20 years of friendship are basically ruined and all she did was try to help me.  Whatever.  Well I think it\'s ridiculous that I can\'t even take a bubble bath while paying to live here but she can get tats and go on cross country trips.  Over the summer she told me she couldn\'t afford to turn the AC on either unless I start contributing more.  She said the AC raises the electric bill by $50 a month and she needs me to help if I want it on.   I\'m sick of being denied basic comforts while she can get tats and go on trips. Oh and as of today (Halloween) she is posting all over social media about going to work at some big tattoo convention in 2023 and possibly going to Germany with her SO who is from there.  SMH...  Just wow.    So am I the asshole?   If anyone is wondering I am 40 and she is 43.  We live somewhere where the cost of living is pretty high if anyone is question why 2 grown women are living together.'}]","OP has been living with FF for 5 years, paying rent only sporadically, and expecting FF to prioritize the bathroom remodel over her own expenses and comforts. Meanwhile, FF has been saving for the remodel, but has also been spending money on her own interests, such as tattoos and a cross-country road trip. OP feels entitled to basic comforts, such as a functional bathroom and air conditioning, but is not contributing to the household expenses. FF has been shouldering the costs of living with OP, and OP's behavior is seen as unfair and entitled.",'AITA for Expecting My Partner to Prioritize My Comforts Over Her Own?',"Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Expecting My Partner to Prioritize My Comforts Over Her Own?'","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

Kim and I have known each other since college and are really close. Kim and her husband have been together for over 3 years. They met at work when they were both working as graphic designers. Kim no longer works in graphic design and graduated about a year ago with a masters in a different field.\n\nSo at dinner, Aiden brought up a podcast he listened to talking about a girl who signed a car lease for her new boyfriend. This lead to us discussing how we split finances in our own relationships. My husband and I split expenses based on income, we also have joint and separate accounts. My husband makes 10k more than me, so he pays a greater percentage of our expenses. Aiden brought up that he and Kim split expenses 50/50.\n\nI was a little surprised because Kim makes significantly more then he does after her career change. By significant, she has told me she makes 115k which is 45k more than her husband. When I questioned why they split 50/50 instead of proportionally based on income, Kim gave me a nasty look. But I pushed the question a little more and Kim erupted saying that their finances were none of my business. \n\nI was taken aback because I didn't expect this topic to be a sore spot and Kim and I both talk a lot about demolishing traditional gender roles. I pointed out that it probably wasn't super fair to be splitting 50/50 when you make a lot more than your partner.

We’ve built a great relationship, but I have to admit, I struggle with some of her habits that feel a bit inconsiderate to me. A few months ago, we moved in together, and that's when these issues started to arise more frequently.

One major thing that has bothered me is Sarah's penchant for keeping the thermostat set at a chilly 65 degrees Fahrenheit. I’ve always been someone who feels more comfortable in a warmer environment—around 72 degrees is my sweet spot. I’ve tried to explain this to her multiple times, but she insists that she prefers the cooler air and doesn’t see the need to adjust it for my comfort. I understand that she’s paying part of the bills too, but I feel like in a partnership, we should be able to accommodate each other's needs.

Recently, I told her that I felt she should prioritize my comfort over her preferences, especially since I often find myself wrapped in layers just to feel somewhat comfortable at home. Sarah got really upset, saying that she shouldn’t have to change her lifestyle just because I’m uncomfortable. I tried to emphasize that a bit of compromise could really go a long way in our relationship, but she said it felt unfair to her that I was asking her to change for me.

Now, our friends have weighed in, and they mostly side with her, saying that feelings of comfort and home should be a two-way street and that imposing my comfort over hers is unreasonable. I’ve been reflecting, and part of me feels like I might be selfish for wanting her to bend to my way of comfort rather than working towards a solution together.

I can’t help but think maybe I’m wrong in expecting her to place my comfort above her own. So, AITA for expecting my partner to prioritize my comforts over her own?","My partner, Sarah (29F), and I (31M) have been living together for about two years now. Our relationship has generally been smooth, though we've had our occasional disagreements like any couple. One recent issue, however, has sparked a bit more conflict than usual.

Sarah has always been particular about her living environment. She likes to keep the apartment cool, around 68°F (20°C), which she finds comfortable. I, on the other hand, prefer a warmer setting, around 75°F (24°C). Whenever Sarah is out or busy, I usually adjust the thermostat to my liking. But when she's home, she quickly changes it back, claiming she can't focus or relax if it's too warm.

A few nights ago, we had a pretty heated argument about it. I was working from home and wanted the temperature set to 75°F. Sarah was in the other room, and when she came out, she noticed the change and immediately turned it back down. This led to a back-and-forth exchange of thermostat adjustments, and ultimately, both of us were frustrated.

I argued that I should be comfortable in my own home, especially since I was working and needed to concentrate. I told her that my comfort should be prioritized since I spend more time at home due to my job. Sarah countered saying that her comfort is just as important, especially since she suffers from migraines and the cooler temperature helps prevent them.

Our friends are divided. Some think I have a point and deserve to be comfortable, especially given I work from home. Others side with Sarah, saying that migraines and her physical discomfort should take precedence over my preference for warmth.

Now, our thermostat has become a symbol of our conflict, and the tension between us has slightly grown. We're both stubborn and neither of us wants to back down, but deep down, I wonder if I'm being unreasonable.

So, AITA for expecting my partner to prioritize my comforts over her own and wanting to keep the apartment warmer when I'm working?","My partner, Sarah (28), and I (29) have been together for about 3 years now. We live together in a small apartment, and we generally get along pretty well. However, we've been having some issues lately regarding our daily routines and personal space.

The thing is, I'm a bit of a homebody and I like my comforts. I like to wake up late, have my coffee in bed, and then spend some time playing video games or watching TV before starting my day. Sarah, on the other hand, is a morning person and she likes to get up early, go for a run, and then start her day.

We've been trying to find a compromise, but it seems like I'm always the one giving in. I've asked Sarah to wake up later and join me for breakfast, but she always says she needs to get her run in before starting her day. I've also asked her to turn down the volume on her alarm clock, which she finds really annoying, but I just can't handle the loud noise.

The other day, we had a big argument because Sarah came home from her run and started doing laundry, which woke me up from my nap. I told her that she needs to be more considerate of my sleep schedule and my personal space, and she got really upset with me.

She said that I'm being selfish and that she can't just stop living her life because of my comfort levels. She also said that I need to learn to be more flexible and adaptable.

I feel like I'm being reasonable and that I'm the one who's always giving in. I don't see why Sarah can't just prioritize my comforts over her own needs. I mean, it's not like she's doing anything that's hurting anyone else, right?

Recently, though, I had an incident that really tested my patience.

I was handling a project and had a conference call with one of my employees, who has a reputation for being dismissive of women in the workplace. During the call, he made some offhand comments about how ""a woman wouldn't understand"" the technical aspects we were discussing. I tried to brush it off initially and redirected the conversation back to the project, but he just doubled down with more condescending remarks.

I felt my blood boiling, especially since this wasn’t the first time he’d acted like this. After several attempts to maintain my composure, I finally lost my temper. I told him that it was 2023 and that his attitude was unacceptable. I called him out directly and used some strong profanity, which I absolutely regret but felt was the only way to show how serious and frustrated I was.

After the call, I had a few colleagues reach out. Some were supportive, saying they admired me for standing up to him. Others, however, said I crossed a line by using profanity and that it reflected poorly on my leadership skills. They argued that while his comments were inappropriate, losing my temper made me look unprofessional.

Since then, the employee has filed a complaint against me, and HR is involved. I feel justified in my response but also realize that maybe I could have handled it differently—perhaps with more tact or by escalating the situation without getting personal.

So, am I the asshole for losing my temper and using profanity during the call? I genuinely thought I was standing up for myself and for a more respectful workplace. ","I (F34) manage a small team at a tech company. It’s a great job generally, but there's one employee, John (M28), who has been a thorn in my side. John is talented but has a noticeable issue with respecting female authority. This isn't just my opinion; several of my female colleagues have experienced his dismissiveness as well.

Last week, we were having a video conference to discuss an important project. Given the complexity, I needed everyone's full attention and cooperation. Mid-meeting, John started talking over me and dismissing my points. This isn't new behavior for him, but it was especially bad this time. When I called him out, he smirked and said, ""Maybe if you understood the tech side better, you wouldn't have these issues.""

At that point, I saw red. I snapped back, telling him that his sexist attitude was unacceptable and that he needed to get his act together. As the argument escalated, I lost my temper and used some profanity. Specifically, I said, “Stop being a condescending asshole and listen for once.” The meeting ended abruptly, and I immediately regretted my choice of words, although not the sentiment behind them.

After the meeting, I received mixed feedback. Some of my coworkers, especially the women, appreciated that I stood up to John. Others thought I crossed a line by losing my cool and using profanity, arguing that as a manager, I should maintain professionalism, even when provoked.

HR got involved when John filed a complaint about the hostile work environment. Now, I’m under scrutiny for my reaction, and John is getting off with a slap on the wrist for his behavior.

Relations in the team are strained. Some respect me more for standing my ground, while others seem wary of my temper. I know I should’ve handled it better, but I was fed up with his blatant disrespect.

So, AITA for losing my temper and using profanity during a call with a sexist employee?","I (32 F) work as a marketing manager for a small tech startup. I'm the only female in a team of seven, and while my colleagues are generally supportive, there have been some... let's call them ""moments"" in the past that have made me feel like I'm not taken seriously.

One such moment occurred during a call with a sexist employee, 45-year-old John (no first name given, but I'll refer to him as such). We're working on a big project, and I was trying to explain some complex data analysis to him. John kept interrupting me, talking over me, and making condescending comments about my understanding of the subject matter.

I tried to remain calm and professional, but it got to the point where I just lost my temper. I told John that I was tired of being talked over and that his attitude was not only unhelpful but also sexist. I used some profanity to drive my point home, which I immediately regretted.

The call ended abruptly, with John hanging up on me. My boss, who was cc'd on the call, called me into his office to discuss the incident. He was visibly uncomfortable and told me that while he understood where I was coming from, my use of profanity was unprofessional and unacceptable.

I tried to explain that John's behavior was what triggered my outburst, but my boss seemed more concerned with avoiding a conflict than actually addressing the underlying issue. He warned me that using profanity in the future could result in disciplinary action.

I'm still fuming about the whole thing, and I'm not sure what to do next. Part of me thinks I was right to stand up for myself, but another part of me is worried that I overreacted and compromised my professionalism.

75,AITA for giving my husband the green light to accept his mom's lavish gifts when she gives our children shitty ones?,"My MIL is a very difficult woman. She has struggled a lot with the transition of her kids having kids, as she only views her family as her husband and kids, and does not like ""having a grandmother role forced on her"" When my oldest was born I was naive and thought MIL would help out. I learned that the hard way. She didn't want to do family holidays and just wanted to be alone with her husband, stopped doing family vacations. Honestly I thought it was just because she doesn't like me, but she loves her son in law and isn't any more interested in their children.  I will admit this hurt me and I set pretty harsh boundaries. One of the boundaries was that my husband could not accept gifts from MIL. She would always get him really nice birthday and Christmas gifts and get our kids cheap impersonal junk. MIL's gifts to him were always experiences or hobby related things as he grew up wealthy but does not make the kind of money he grew up with, and she feels he doesn't treat himself enough. Six years ago we told MIL that he would no longer be accepting these gifts as he is a husband and father first, and it isn't right.  Well my husband has been struggling with some depression lately. One of his biggest things is he feels like he is just a husband and father and lost his identity. He feels he gives constantly and gets very little back. I hate seeing him like this, so I called MIL and asked if she wanted to resume giving him gifts and said I would no longer stand in the way.  Well he had a birthday recently and MIL bought him something for his hobby (probably a $10,000-12,000 bike according to the internet) and gave him some gift cards so he could take a weekend away to his favorite trails.

My husband’s birthday is coming up, and his mother, my mother-in-law, has decided to buy him a very expensive bike—think top-of-the-line, several thousand dollars kind of bike. While I can appreciate the gesture, I can’t shake off the feeling that it's overshadowing an important milestone for our daughter, who is also celebrating her birthday just a week before his. 

My husband is quite passionate about biking, and I know he’s been eyeing this bike for a while. But here’s the kicker: it feels like my mother-in-law's gift is making our daughter feel overlooked. She’s been looking forward to her birthday party and had planned a fun celebration with her friends. However, when she found out about the bike, she expressed to me that she feels like she’s not special anymore and that her birthday will be ignored because of the focus on her father’s big gift. 

I’ve tried talking to my mother-in-law about it, suggesting that maybe it would be nice for her to do something a little less extravagant for my husband this year, especially since we want our daughter to feel valued and appreciated on her special day. But my mother-in-law dismissed my concerns, saying it’s just a bike and it's what he wants. She also seemed to suggest that I might be overreacting. 

Now, I’m feeling caught in the middle. I don’t want to come off as controlling or jealous of my husband’s gift, especially since it will mean a lot to him. But I also can’t ignore how our daughter is feeling and the importance of her birthday. My friends have mixed opinions—some say I should just let it go and let my husband have his moment, while others agree that I should maintain the focus on our daughter's celebration.

So, AITA for allowing my mother-in-law to go ahead with buying my husband this expensive bike, knowing it’s making our daughter feel less special? Or am I being too sensitive about the whole situation?","Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and need some perspective. My husband and I have a seven-year-old daughter, Lily. Recently, my mother-in-law bought my husband an extremely expensive bike worth several thousand dollars. This was something he had been eyeing for a long time and had mentioned in passing a few times. My mother-in-law is quite well-off, and she loves to spoil her family.

The problem arose when Lily saw her dad's new bike and realized how expensive and special it was. She got very upset and told us she feels like she's not special because she never gets anything as nice. I tried explaining to her that it was a gift from grandma and that adults sometimes get different kinds of presents. It didn't seem to help much, and now she's been moping around, clearly feeling left out.

My husband thinks that our daughter will get over it and that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. He argues that the bike was something he really wanted and it was an opportunity that he couldn't say no to. My mother-in-law also feels that she was just trying to do something nice for her son and doesn't see the issue.

However, some of my friends have suggested that it was insensitive to allow such a lavish gift knowing it might upset Lily. They've hinted that it sends a message that her feelings are less important. Now, I'm feeling torn. On one hand, I don't want to seem ungrateful or to dictate what my mother-in-law can buy. On the other hand, I hate seeing my daughter so upset.

Did I make a mistake in letting my mother-in-law buy the bike without considering Lily's feelings more carefully? Am I the asshole for allowing this to happen and making our daughter feel like she's not special?

Thanks for any advice.","I've been married to my husband, Alex, for about 5 years now, and we have a 4-year-old daughter named Emily. Alex's mom, Carol, has always been a bit overbearing when it comes to our family, constantly inserting herself into our lives and trying to be the ""cool grandma"" that Emily looks up to. I've learned to just roll with it, because at the end of the day, it's just easier to let her think she's being included.

Recently, Carol had been pestering Alex about getting a new bike, saying that it would be great for them to ride together and spend quality time. Alex kept telling her that they didn't need one, but Carol wouldn't let up. Finally, a few days ago, she showed up at our doorstep with a brand new, super-expensive bike that she'd bought for Alex, along with a bunch of accessories and a note that said ""Can't wait for our next adventure together!""

The problem is, Emily has been begging for a bike for months now, and we've been promising her that we'll get her one soon. But now, with Alex having this new, super-expensive bike, Emily keeps saying ""Why can't I have a bike like Daddy's?"" and it's just breaking my heart. Alex keeps saying that Emily can have one soon, but it feels like he's making excuses and not really committed to getting her one.

Carol's been calling me nonstop, saying that she's so excited for Alex to have his new bike and that Emily will ""just have to wait a little longer"" for hers. I've tried to explain to her that this is making Emily feel left out and special, but she just won't listen.

I feel like I'm the only one who's really looking out for Emily's feelings here, but at the same time, I don't want to come across as the ""mean"" one who's ruining everything. AITA for not letting Carol buy Alex the bike, or is this just a classic case of overbearing mother-in-law syndrome?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Hi everyone,\n\nI’m in a bit of a tricky situation and need some perspective. My husband and I have a seven-year-old daughter, Lily. Recently, my mother-in-law bought my husband an extremely expensive bike worth several thousand dollars. This was something he had been eyeing for a long time and had mentioned in passing a few times. My mother-in-law is quite well-off, and she loves to spoil her family.\n\nThe problem arose when Lily saw her dad's new bike and realized how expensive and special it was. She got very upset and told us she feels like she's not special because she never gets anything as nice. I tried explaining to her that it was a gift from grandma and that adults sometimes get different kinds of presents. It didn't seem to help much, and now she's been moping around, clearly feeling left out.\n\nMy husband thinks that our daughter will get over it and that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. He argues that the bike was something he really wanted and it was an opportunity that he couldn't say no to. My mother-in-law also feels that she was just trying to do something nice for her son and doesn't see the issue.\n\nHowever, some of my friends have suggested that it was insensitive to allow such a lavish gift knowing it might upset Lily. They've hinted that it sends a message that her feelings are less important. Now, I'm feeling torn. On one hand, I don't want to seem ungrateful or to dictate what my mother-in-law can buy. On the other hand, I hate seeing my daughter so upset.\n\nDid I make a mistake in letting my mother-in-law buy the bike without considering Lily's feelings more carefully? Am I the asshole for allowing this to happen and making our daughter feel like she's not special?\n\nThanks for any advice.""}]","{

She is still telling people that she knows she can’t make it her top priority but she feels she needs to run because a few friends nominated her (and she self-nominated..). I tried explaining that this both hurt personally and professionally as well as that I genuinely think it is not wise as she has zero experience and would rely (I.e. lean) far too heavily on the co-chair. Things have turned pretty ugly. I respect that she has a right to run, but wow does it feel personal! I keep wavering on feeling like I’m being petty or justifiably angry…. So AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks for the feedback. I forgot to include one of the biggest reasons I’m upset (and shared this with my friend) is that I think there’s a very good chance she & I will be the ones elected, ousting the current co-chair who deserves it (by her hard work, dedication, & knowledge! As in, she will do the best job) most of all.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Firing the Dog Sitter for Sleeping in My Bed?'""}]","I have a pretty tight-knit family, and we all love our pets. When I needed a dog sitter for a weekend trip, I called my sister, who has a good rapport with my dog and had watched him before. She's always been great with him, and I trusted her to take care of my fur baby while I was gone.

Before I left, I made it clear that my dog is not allowed on the furniture—especially my bed. I even have a specific set of rules for sitter duties to keep things consistent for my pup and to respect my space. I thought everything was set.

However, when I got back from my trip, I was met with an unexpected surprise. My sister casually mentioned that she had let my dog sleep in my bed with her every night I was gone. I was taken aback! Not only did I feel that she disregarded my explicit instructions, but I was also upset that she had crossed a boundary that I’ve set. It’s my home, and I don’t want to deal with pet hair or the potential misbehavior that could come from allowing him on the bed, especially when he’s not used to it.

When I confronted her about it, she brushed it off, saying, “It’s just a dog, what’s the big deal?” I explained that it was a big deal to me and that I felt disrespected, leading to some heated discussions between us. I ultimately decided to end our dog-sitting arrangement and told her I would look for someone else in the future since she clearly couldn’t respect my wishes.

My family has mixed opinions. Some agree with me, believing that as the pet owner, I have the right to set boundaries. Others think I overreacted and that it was just a harmless situation. I can’t help but feel guilty for firing my sister over what some see as a minor infraction.

So, AITA for firing my sister as my dog sitter for letting my dog sleep in my bed?","I recently hired a dog sitter to take care of my two dogs while I was away on a business trip for a week. She came highly recommended and had great reviews, so I felt confident leaving my beloved pets in her care. I gave her clear instructions about the dogs’ routines, feeding schedules, and where she could sleep—specifically mentioning the guest room.

When I returned home, everything seemed fine at first; the dogs were happy and healthy, the house was clean, and she had left a detailed note about how the week had gone. However, later that night, when I went to bed, I noticed something odd. The bedding was different from how I had left it. I found a strand of her hair on my pillow and realized that she had been sleeping in my bed. This made me uncomfortable, as I have a fairly personal connection with my sleeping space and had explicitly told her to use the guest room.

Feeling a bit grossed out and invaded, I contacted her and asked if she had slept in my bed. She admitted she had, explaining that she had trouble sleeping on the guest bed because of her bad back and that she didn’t think it would be a big deal. I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with her decision and that I no longer needed her services in the future.

I mentioned this to a few friends, expecting them to back me up, but opinions were mixed. Some agreed with me, saying it was a breach of trust and boundaries, while others thought I overreacted, arguing that she was simply trying to get a good night's sleep and that it didn’t cause any real harm.

Now, the dog sitter left me a message expressing how hurt she was by my decision, saying it was difficult to find work and that she felt her actions didn't warrant being fired. 

I’m conflicted because I value my personal space but also don't want to be unfair or overly harsh, especially since she did take good care of the dogs. 

So, am I the asshole for firing the dog sitter for sleeping in my bed?
","I (28f) recently got back from a two-week trip and was excited to see my dog, Luna, again. My usual dog sitter, Sarah, was hired to take care of her, but I had been noticing some red flags lately - she would often show up late and seemed really disinterested in taking care of Luna.

When I got back, I was surprised to find out that Sarah had been sleeping in my bed, which is definitely not okay. The sheets were rumpled, and there was even a hair clip from Sarah's hair on my pillow. I was appalled and immediately called Sarah to confront her.

Sarah claimed that she was ""just resting"" and didn't think it was a big deal. She said she had been taking care of Luna and was just exhausted. I told her that she needed to leave immediately and that I would be looking for a new dog sitter.

Sarah got defensive and started yelling at me, saying that I was being unfair and that she had been a great dog sitter for years. She even accused me of being a ""controlling"" person who couldn't trust her to take care of Luna. I stood firm and told her that her behavior was unacceptable and that she was fired.

My friends and family think I was right to fire Sarah, but my boyfriend (who is a huge dog lover) thinks I overreacted. He says that Sarah was just tired and didn't mean any harm. He even suggested that I should have just talked to her about it instead of firing her.

I'm still reeling from the whole situation and I don't know what to think. Am I the asshole for firing Sarah, or was she completely in the wrong for sleeping in my bed?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""I recently hired a dog sitter to take care of my two dogs while I was away on a business trip for a week.

77,AITA for being mad and not letting my mom buy me a birthday present,"I (26m) had my birthday about a month ago. Normally my mom throws people big parties on their birthday. She's done it for everyone in the family including my older sister, dad, and herself, except for me. We had a small family dinner that she decided for my birthday. Leading up to my birthday I gave my parents a list of things I would like if they were going to get me a gift. I have lots of interests/hobbies and talk to both of my parents about them all of the time so they know what kind of things I like. Well at my birthday, I didn't get any gifts. I was a little upset ngl, but was like whatever and went and bought myself the things I wanted most the next day. My mom said sorry she didn't get me anything but it was because she didn't know what to get me.

However, things took a turn recently after a family gathering where she made some really hurtful comments about my career choices and life decisions. It felt like she was belittling everything I’ve worked hard for, and I tried to express how her words had impacted me. Instead of acknowledging my feelings, she brushed it off and made jokes, which didn’t sit well with me at all.

As my birthday approached, I found myself feeling conflicted about how to celebrate. My mom offered to take me out for dinner, which I appreciated, but deep down, I knew I wanted something more meaningful—an acknowledgment of our recent tension. I hoped for a heartfelt apology, a real conversation about what happened, but all I got was a half-hearted message saying, “I’m sorry if you were offended.” That didn’t feel genuine to me.

So, I decided to treat myself to a birthday gift that I had been eyeing for a while. It’s something that symbolizes my journey and accomplishments—something I felt I deserved after everything. I bought it on the actual day of my birthday and shared a photo of it on social media. My friends were supportive and celebrated with me, but when my mom saw the post, she was upset. She felt like I was being childish for buying myself a gift instead of accepting her “apology” and enjoying what she had to offer.

My friends are split on the situation. Some think I have every right to treat myself, especially after how I felt during our last interaction. Others believe I should have accepted her gesture and not made it so public. I’ve tried to explain my feelings to her, but she’s still hurt and thinks I’m being difficult.

Now, I’m left wondering if I overreacted. AITA for buying myself a birthday gift because my mom's apology just wasn’t enough for me?","So, here's some backstory. I'm a 24-year-old woman, and my mom and I have had a rocky relationship for as long as I can remember. She tends to forget important dates and milestones in my life, including my birthday. This has been a sore point for me, but I've tried to let it go over the years. However, this year I decided to do something different.

My birthday was last week, and as expected, my mom didn't acknowledge it until late in the day. When she did remember, she sent me a brief text that basically said, ""Happy birthday, sorry for forgetting again."" There was nothing heartfelt about it, no call, no effort to make it up to me. I was disappointed but not entirely surprised.

Feeling a bit down, I decided to treat myself. I bought a moderately priced necklace I'd been eyeing for months. It wasn't a huge splurge, just something to make myself feel special and loved. When I posted a photo of it on social media, my mom saw it and called me, upset. She said it made her look bad, and that it was ""disrespectful"" to buy myself a birthday gift when she had apologized.

I tried to explain to her that her apology felt insincere and that I needed to do something for myself. I wasn’t trying to make her look bad; I was just trying to make myself feel good. My friends are divided—some say I'm justified in treating myself, while others think I should have accepted my mom's apology regardless of how it made me feel.

The fallout has been awkward. My mom and I aren't on speaking terms right now, and I can't help but feel guilty for causing a fuss, even if it was unintentional. I didn't want to escalate things, but here we are. 

So, am I the asshole for buying myself a birthday gift because my mom's ""apology"" didn't feel good enough?","I'm a 29-year-old woman, and my mom and I have had a complicated relationship for as long as I can remember. We've been estranged for a few years now, but recently, she reached out and said she wanted to make amends. We started talking again, and she claimed she was ""sorry"" for all the hurt she's caused me over the years.

However, her idea of an apology is just giving me a generic, insincere message on Facebook. No actual effort to understand why I was hurt, no acknowledgment of her own wrongdoing, just a vague statement saying she's ""sorry"" and wants to move forward. It's clear to me that she's only doing this because she feels guilty for not seeing me at family gatherings or keeping in touch.

To make matters worse, she then proceeded to send me a ""birthday gift"" – a $20 candle set from a big-box store. It's not even something I would buy for myself, let alone something that shows she's putting any thought into making amends. I felt like she was just trying to buy my forgiveness, rather than actually making an effort to understand and make things right.

I decided to take matters into my own hands and bought myself a birthday gift that I've been wanting for a while – a new watch. It's something I've been eyeing for months, and it makes me happy. I'm not asking for much, but I think it's reasonable to expect a bit more effort from my mom if she wants to repair our relationship.

WIBTA if I'm being unreasonable for buying myself a birthday gift because my mom's apology isn't good enough? Or am I justified in setting boundaries and expecting more from someone who claims to want to make amends?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'So, here\'s some backstory.

78,AITA for telling my brother to not apologize?,"I (21nb) lived with my brother (23m) and his ex-girlfriend (21f) for a little less than a year now. I moved in with them under the agreement that I would help pay the mortgage for my brother's new condo. He and I had arranged this before things got serious between them. While this condo had his name and only his name on the deed, he had every intention of sharing it with his ex.   To say the breakup was ugly is putting it lightly. She ended up saying and doing some really nasty things to both me and him, and took everything from their room and the communal spaces, including most of his things as well as mine. He isn't innocent either, he did some pretty messed up stuff, but not to the extent of what she did. My brother is absolutely heartbroken, understandably, and is starting to despise this place. Like I said, while her name wasn't on the deed, this was her home as much as it was his.   To go along with everything that has happened my health has been on the decline, making me strapped for cash trying to figure out the problem. Recently my brother decided that he is going to move out and raise the rent of this place so it'll pay for his new place (he will be renting with a couple of his buddies). I can't afford it, and I tried to negotiate something that would fit both of our needs. He said that wouldn't happen and told me he would be moving out at the end of the year. I don't have any place to go besides my parents, and while I love them dearly, my mom and I do not get along and he knows that.   This is the part where I may be the AH. The other night I was having a panic attack from all of the stress that has been weighing on me when my brother walked by on his way to work. He asked me what was wrong. When I tried explaining to him that while I understood why he was moving out and raising rent and all that, it puts me in a terrible position and he knows that I wouldn't be able to find my own place even with the help of friends because of the amount of medical debt that is piling at my feet. All he said was ""I'm sorry"", and something in me broke.  I told him to not apologize because he knew of this already, and yet chose to follow through on his plan, and that the only reason he was apologizing was because I was upset. He left without saying anything else.  This morning I got a call from my mom demanding why I would say ""such awful things to my brother"" and demanding that I apologize to him because he's going through it right now. I tried to explain my side and she wouldn't hear it, and just kept repeating that I'm an asshole and I need to apologize.

We’ve always had a pretty good relationship as roommates, splitting bills and chores, and I thought we were on the same page about living arrangements.

Recently, Jake dropped a bombshell on me: he’s planning to move out in a couple of months and wants to raise the rent for the remaining time we’ll be living together. The rent is already pretty steep, and I have been struggling to make ends meet since my job hours got cut back. Now, suddenly, he’s telling me he wants to increase it by 25% because he feels he needs to “maximize his investment” and “there’s a lot of demand for this place.”

I felt completely blindsided. I admit I lashed out at him. I told him it was incredibly selfish to raise the rent when he was planning to leave me high and dry and that he clearly didn’t care about the arrangement we had. I might’ve said some nasty things about his priorities and how he could be more considerate of my situation. Jake looked shocked and really hurt by my reaction, and we ended up arguing for a while before he left to stay with a friend.

After cooling down, I felt pretty bad about how I handled it. I realized I could have approached the situation differently instead of immediately getting defensive and angry. Jake’s decision to move out is ultimately his choice, but the way I reacted to the rent increase was definitely over the top.

Our parents have been somewhat split on this. My mom thinks I was justified because I had a right to be upset about the rent raise, especially since I’m in a tough spot financially. My dad, on the other hand, says I should’ve kept my cool and handled it more maturely since he is still my brother, and family should support each other.

Now there’s tension between us, and I’m worried about how we’ll handle the living situation going forward. So, AITA for lashing out at my brother when he told me he’s raising the rent and moving out?","My brother, Jack (28M), and I (25F) have been sharing an apartment for the past three years. Our arrangement had always worked well: we split the rent and utilities equally, and chores were divided. Living together allowed us to save money, and we enjoyed each other's company. 

A few weeks ago, Jack told me he was planning to move out. He's been dating someone seriously, and they decided to take the next step and get a place together. While I was happy for him, the news caught me off guard. The rent for our apartment is already on the higher side, and with him leaving, I'd be responsible for the whole amount unless I found a new roommate fast.

Jack then mentioned that he would be raising my share of the rent for the final month he stays here to cover some additional costs he incurred while looking for a new place and to help him with the transition. He gave me about a month's notice but said that the next payment would be nearly double what I usually pay. I felt blindsided and overwhelmed by this sudden financial burden.

I couldn't help myself; I lashed out at him, accusing him of being selfish and inconsiderate. I told him it was unfair to expect me to cover his costs and that he should have planned better. We ended up having a heated argument, and he left the apartment for a few days to cool off. 

Our family and friends have mixed opinions. Some think Jack should have been more considerate of my situation, while others believe I overreacted and should support him during his transition. Jack and I haven't spoken much since the argument, and the tension is palpable.

I'm starting to realize that maybe my reaction was too harsh. While Jack's request was unexpected and stressful for me, I understand he's also going through a significant life change. Perhaps I could have approached the situation more calmly and tried to negotiate a more manageable solution.

Am I the asshole for lashing out at my brother when he told me he's raising the rent and moving out?","My brother and I have been living together in a small two-bedroom apartment for the past three years. We've always had a decent relationship, and he's never really caused any issues. However, about six months ago, he started bringing his girlfriend over more frequently, and eventually, she started moving in permanently. I've never been too fond of her, but I've tried to be civil.

Recently, my brother came to me and said that he and his girlfriend are getting serious and they're planning to get married. He also told me that they're looking to start a family, and they need a bigger place. He said that they've been looking at apartments in the area and found one that they love, but it's more expensive than our current place. He told me that he's going to be raising the rent by $300, and if I don't agree to it, he'll have to start looking for a new roommate.

I was taken aback by the news, and I immediately started listing all the reasons why I couldn't afford the increased rent. I told him that I was barely scraping by as it is, and that $300 is a significant amount of money for me. I also mentioned that I've been paying my share of the bills on time, and I don't think it's fair for him to just raise the rent without giving me any notice.

My brother listened to me, but he didn't seem to care. He just kept repeating that he needs a bigger place and that he's willing to pay the difference himself if I don't want to stay. I got frustrated with him and started yelling at him, telling him that he's being insensitive and selfish. I also accused him of not caring about our relationship and that he's only thinking about himself and his girlfriend.

The argument ended with my brother telling me that he's already signed the lease for the new apartment and that I need to decide whether I want to stay or not. I'm still fuming about the whole situation, and I'm not sure if I want to stay.

I told him it was unfair to expect me to cover his costs and that he should have planned better. We ended up having a heated argument, and he left the apartment for a few days to cool off. \n\nOur family and friends have mixed opinions. Some think Jack should have been more considerate of my situation, while others believe I overreacted and should support him during his transition. Jack and I haven't spoken much since the argument, and the tension is palpable.\n\nI'm starting to realize that maybe my reaction was too harsh. While Jack's request was unexpected and stressful for me, I understand he's also going through a significant life change. Perhaps I could have approached the situation more calmly and tried to negotiate a more manageable solution.\n\nAm I the asshole for lashing out at my brother when he told me he's raising the rent and moving out?""}]","{

Fake names.\n\nI (37 F) decided a couple months ago with my husband (40 M) that it was time to get our kids a dog because they were old enough to care for one. My kids are Rose (8 F) and Isabella (10 F). My husband had a boxer as a kid and said that he has fond memories with that kind of dog so we decided to get one and surprise the kids. He is now five months old. I\'m sure many of you will understand that because he is a puppy he needs a lot of exercise because he is very high energy. We often take him on walks at the park near our house because it has several very long walking paths.\n\nWell, this past weekend there was an event going on at the lower half of the park, so it was closed off so all we had left was the top half. It was just me and my daughter Rose because my husband had to pick up Isabella from a friend\'s house. While at the park my daughter kept begging me to hold Coopers leash. After a while I gave in. While Rose was walking him another dog came by and Cooper got excited and started running over which pulled my daughter who let go of the leash. Cooper ran over to the other dog trying to play and all of a sudden I heard screaming at me to ""get my dog"". My daughter ran over and started crying while the girl (2oish F?) held her dog down with her arm in his mouth and screamed at me to stop standing there. The man with her started yelling at me to stop my dog who was jumping with excitement. After the shock wore off, I rushed over and removed my dog checking Cooper and Rose. The man with her started yelling at me that I was being irresponsible by letting the dog walk free in a leash required area and that people like them take their rescues there for training and I probably just destroyed months work of progress with their dog. I explained he was being held but my daughter dropped by accident and that he needed to stop yelling as it was scaring my kid. He started yelling that if my daughter wasn\'t strong enough to hold the dog she shouldn\'t be walking it or take it to a unleashed area to practice. When we got home Rose was still crying. When my husband asked what happened and I told him, he was angry at me telling me that I need to be more responsible and that I was at fault.

AITA?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Pressuring My Sister to Risk Her Money to Help Our Brothers?'""}]","I (28 F) have two brothers, Jake (22 M) and Tom (19 M), and a sister, Emily (25 F). We're all close in age, and growing up, we always supported each other through various challenges. However, our family dynamic has become more complicated as we've gotten older.

Recently, Jake and Tom have both gotten themselves into financial trouble. Jake lost his job due to layoffs, and Tom racked up some debt from a failed business venture. They approached me for help, and while I want to support them, I told them I could only do so much. I’m not in a position to lend them thousands of dollars since I have my own savings goals.

That's when I thought about Emily. She recently received a sizable inheritance from our grandparents, and she’s been living comfortably without any major financial worries. I reached out to her, asking if she could consider helping our brothers with a small loan or even a financial gift. I stressed that it would really mean a lot to our family and that it could help Jake get back on his feet while giving Tom a chance to restructure his finances.

Emily hesitated and said she was hesitant to risk her money on their poor decisions, which I can understand to some extent, but she’s always been someone who advocates for family support. I pushed her a bit more, saying things like, ""You have the means to help, and it would really make a difference,"" and that she should consider the potential consequences if we let them struggle alone.

Things escalated when Emily finally told me that I was putting her in a difficult position and that she didn't appreciate feeling pressured. She accused me of trying to manipulate her into making a decision she was uncomfortable with. I got frustrated and told her that family is supposed to help each other in tough times.

Now, our conversations are strained, and she hasn't spoken to me much since. I feel bad that I pushed her, but I also think that I was just trying to do what’s best for our family and give the boys a fighting chance. I might have gone too far with my pressure on her, but I genuinely want to support my brothers without putting myself in a financially risky situation.

So, AITA for pressuring my sister to risk her money to help our brothers?","I (32F) have three siblings: my older sister, Lisa (35F), and my two younger brothers, Jake (30M) and Ryan (28M). Growing up, Lisa was always the responsible one. She worked extra jobs in high school and saved meticulously, while Jake and Ryan were more laid-back and kind of lived in the moment. Now, Lisa has a steady job, a great house, and a healthy savings account, whereas my brothers have struggled financially.

Recently, Jake's business started failing due to various reasons, including the economic downturn, and Ryan lost his job. Both of them came to me asking for help. I'm not in a position to offer financial aid myself since my husband and I are still paying off our mortgage and have two kids to support. Desperate to help my brothers, I turned to Lisa. I suggested she could help them out financially since she's in a better position.

Lisa was hesitant. She said she's worked hard for her savings and has her own financial goals and future to consider, especially since she’s planning to buy a second property for investment. I tried to reason with her, saying that family should support each other, especially in hard times, and that our brothers are in dire straits. I even went as far as reminding her of how Jake helped her move into her first apartment and how Ryan always babysat her kids for free when they were little.

Lisa stood firm, saying she's willing to help in other ways, like offering career advice or helping them find job opportunities, but she didn’t want to risk her money, especially without any guarantee of getting it back. I got frustrated and told her she was being selfish and not considering the gravity of our brothers' situations. I said that sometimes, family needs to make sacrifices for each other, just like our parents did for us.

This led to a big argument, and Lisa hasn’t spoken to me much since. My brothers are upset too, feeling betrayed by her reluctance to help them out of their current predicaments. Meanwhile, some mutual friends think I’m overstepping by pressuring Lisa to give up her hard-earned savings, while others believe family should come first and Lisa should be more willing to help.

Now, our family dinners are filled with tension, and the strain on our relationships is palpable. I’m starting to wonder if I crossed a line. Did I go too far by pressuring Lisa to risk her financial stability to help our brothers?

AITA for trying to pressure my sister into risking her money for our brothers?","My family has always been super close-knit, and we've always looked out for each other. My sister (30), my brother (28) and I have been working together in our family business for years, and we've always shared the profits equally. However, my brother has recently gotten into some financial trouble - he invested in a business that didn't work out, and now he's in deep debt.

My sister and I have always been pretty responsible with our finances, so we're in a better position to help him out. However, my sister is really struggling to make ends meet right now - she's been working multiple jobs just to keep her head above water. Despite this, I kept bugging her to lend my brother some money, saying that it's our family's responsibility to take care of each other and that we'll be able to help him get back on his feet.

My sister has been hesitant, and I've been pressuring her to give my brother a loan of $10,000. I've been saying things like ""it's just $10,000, it's not a lot to you,"" and ""if you really care about our brother, you'll help him out."" My sister has been telling me that she can't afford it, but I keep pushing her to reconsider.

Last night, I had a huge argument with my sister - she finally lost her patience and told me that she's not going to lend my brother the money, and that I need to stop pressuring her. She said that she's already doing everything she can to help my brother, and that it's not her responsibility to bail him out. I got really angry and defensive, and we ended up not speaking to each other.

I feel like I'm being a good sibling by trying to help my brother out, but at the same time, I realize that I've been really insensitive to my sister's financial struggles. Am I the asshole for pressuring my sister to risk her money to help our brother?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""I (32F) have three siblings: my older sister, Lisa (35F), and my two younger brothers, Jake (30M) and Ryan (28M).

80,"AITA for confronting MIL's boyfriend, calling him a loser, and saying he needs to grow the hell up?","We currently live with MIL as we couldn't pay our rent.

My relationship with my mother-in-law (MIL, F55) has always been a bit rocky; she can be passive-aggressive, and I often feel like she undermines my parenting choices. Recently, she started dating someone new (M45) who I’ll refer to as “Dave.” Initially, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, wanting to support my MIL’s happiness.

However, I quickly realized that something about Dave didn't sit right with me. He often made inappropriate comments about my kids, like how he used to love playing rough with his friend's kids and how he thought my son would love that too. He also seemed overly touchy, insisting on hugging my daughter even when she looked uncomfortable. I brought my concerns up to my husband, and he shared them with his mom. Her response was to dismiss my feelings and defend Dave, insisting I was overreacting.

After a particularly unsettling incident where Dave joked about how my kids would “get used to him” and that “kids need to toughen up,” I decided I had to confront him. I told Dave that his comments were inappropriate and made me uncomfortable, especially regarding my kids. Instead of taking it seriously, he laughed it off and said I was being a “typical overprotective mom.”

When my MIL found out about our confrontation, she blew up at me. She accused me of trying to push her boyfriend away and ruining her happiness. I stood my ground, explaining that my kids’ safety and comfort come first, and I couldn’t just sit back and let this slide. This has now caused a massive rift between me and my MIL. She’s refused to speak to me since and has been telling family members that I am trying to control her life.

Guess what? Now I feel guilt creeping in. I know my intentions were to protect my kids, but losing my MIL's approval feels heavy. My husband is supportive of my decision, but he also fears that this could alienate his mom even further.

So, AITA for confronting my MIL's boyfriend about my concerns, even though it meant losing her approval?","So, here's some backstory. My MIL (57) started dating this guy, Mark (60), about a year ago. At first, he seemed nice enough, a bit rough around the edges, but who isn't? Over time, though, I've noticed some things that really concerned me. He drinks a lot, and when he does, he gets really loud and aggressive. He's never been physical with anyone in the family, but his temper is seriously alarming. We have two kids, 6 and 8, and their safety is my top priority.

One night, during a family gathering at our house, Mark got hammered. He started ranting about politics and got super confrontational with my wife (32). He was yelling, and our kids were terrified. I tried to diffuse the situation, but he just got angrier. Eventually, I had enough and told him to leave our house. MIL was upset and tried to calm him down, but he wasn't having it. I told him that his behavior was unacceptable and that he was not welcome in our home until he could control his drinking and temper.

MIL was furious with me. She said I was overreacting and that Mark was just going through a rough patch. She accused me of trying to control her life and told me that if I couldn't accept Mark, I was risking her relationship with her grandkids. I was shocked. My wife was torn, as she didn't want to upset her mother but also didn't want Mark around our kids if he was going to act like that.

Since then, there's been a lot of tension. MIL hasn't visited as much, and when she does, she insists Mark comes too. I've stuck to my guns, telling her that Mark is not welcome in our home until he gets help for his drinking. My wife is caught in the middle, and it's causing strain on our marriage. Some of our friends think I did the right thing, but others believe I should have handled it differently to avoid alienating MIL.

So, AITA for confronting MIL's boyfriend and potentially losing her approval? I feel like I needed to protect my family, but maybe there's a better way I could have handled it.","My husband and I (both 30) have been married for five years, and we have two beautiful kids. His mom (MIL) has always been super involved in our family, which is great, but over the past year, she's started to bring her new boyfriend, Mike, around more often. At first, we thought he was okay, but the more we got to know him, the more we realized he's a bit of a toxic influence. He's always belittling our parenting decisions, criticizing our home, and making snide comments about our family's values. We've tried to brush it off, thinking maybe he's just joking or doesn't mean to be hurtful, but honestly, it's been really draining.

One day, Mike made a comment that really set us off. He said that our kids would be better off if they were raised by their grandparents (my husband's parents) instead of us. I lost it, and I called him out on his insensitivity. I told him that his comments were unacceptable and that he needed to respect our family's boundaries. My husband was with me, and we both made it clear that we didn't want Mike around our kids anymore.

The aftermath was...interesting. My MIL was furious with us, saying we're being too harsh and that Mike didn't mean any harm. She even went so far as to say that we're being ""ungrateful"" for her love and support. I tried to explain to her that our kids' well-being is our top priority, but she just wouldn't listen.

Now, my MIL has stopped speaking to me, and it's been weeks since we've seen her. My husband is torn between standing up for us and trying to smooth things over with his mom. I'm not sure what to do, but I do know that I'm not sorry for standing up for our family's well-being.

81,AITA for taking my daughters phone away?,"I have a daughter who recently turned 11. She has a different dad from the rest of my children.

This is both of our second marriages and *surprise surprise* not having children due to our age. We each have 2 kids from our previous marriages. My husband has a daughter who is away at college and a 16 year old son who lives with his mom mostly but sometimes with us. Our house is my husband and I, and my 2 kids who are 14 and 12. \n\nOn with the actual event. My husband had a great uncle who recently passed away. He inherited his gently used GMC suv. I don’t know a ton about cars, I know the car is a 2017 and I’ve seen used ones with low mileage go for near $20,000 online (sometimes more). \n\nHere is the issue we are having. Remember how I said my husband’s son is 16? My husband thinks the car would be a great gift to him. He plans on giving him the car regardless of how I feel. I think the fair thing to do would be to sell the car for as much as we can, and divide that money up equally between the 4 kids. That way everyone can benefit and not just my stepson who happens to be 16. \n\nMy husband has been mean to me about this. He is literally telling me I have 0 say. It was HIS uncle, and the car was given to HIM not the family. He said his son has an after school job and he needs the car to be less of a stress on him, I, and his ex (we all sometimes have to chauffeur him to and from work since he has no car) He is 16! If he gets 4-5 grand from the sale of the GMC, that is MORE than enough money for him to buy a starter car that can take him around town and to work. My husband agrees that he technically can do that, but he’s not going to because he wants his son to have this car. \n\nI’m stressed because he is basically telling me that he’s going to do what he wants, and I don’t get a say. Aren’t a husband and wife supposed to come to agreements together? He told me if I have a relative die, we will do whatever I want with the inheritance and he will not interfere one bit. I have major issues with this logic though. \n\nHe even went as far as to say that we can sell the car and split the money up amongst the kids. But now he will go and buy an equal value car for his son out of our joint bank account. I thought it was a jerk thing to say but am I the AH all along?\n\nEdit: I’m the asshole I get it. I’ll stop bugging him about it'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Taking Away My 11-Year-Old's New Phone After Her Dad Bought It for Her?'""}]","I’m a 34-year-old mom to a lively 11-year-old daughter, Mia. Mia has always been a bit of a free spirit and tends to have her own way of doing things. Her father and I divorced when she was pretty young, and since then, her dad has been more of a ""fun parent,"" often indulging her whims and showering her with gifts. 

Last week, Mia came home from a visit at her dad's with a brand new phone. At first, I thought it was just another one of those temporary gadgets, but then she handed it to me while also excitedly explaining how her dad had bought it for her. She’s been asking for a phone for ages, and I’ve been holding off, thinking she’s not quite ready for that responsibility yet. I mean, she still struggles with chores and keeping her room clean!

After I took a look at the phone and all the apps along with the unlimited internet her dad had set up, I felt uneasy. I didn't think she was mature enough to handle the responsibility that comes with such a device and certainly not the unrestricted access to the internet. I had been planning to wait until she was at least in middle school before allowing her to have one. So, I decided to take it away and told Mia that we would discuss it when her dad and I had a chance to talk. 

Mia was understandably upset. She cried and yelled, saying it was unfair and that her dad could just buy her one any time he wanted. I tried explaining my perspective, but she wasn’t having it. I reached out to her dad, and he was furious with me for undermining his decision. He suggested that I was trying to control everything and not letting Mia enjoy the things she wanted. 

Now, both Mia and her dad aren't speaking to me, and I feel like a total villain. My friends say I did the right thing as a parent, wanting to keep her safe and teach her about responsibility, but I can’t shake the feeling that I overstepped. Maybe I should have just let her keep the phone, even though I think it isn't right for her. 

So, am I the asshole for taking away my daughter’s new phone after her dad bought it for her?","I (36F) have been divorced from my ex-husband (38M) for about five years now. We co-parent our 11-year-old daughter, Emma, who splits her time between our houses. My ex and I have had our ups and downs, but I believe we generally do our best to make things work for Emma's sake.

Last weekend when Emma returned from her dad's house, she excitedly showed me her brand-new iPhone. Apparently, her dad had bought it for her as a surprise gift. Emma was over the moon, and I could see how much it meant to her. 

Here's where the problem arises. I have always been very cautious about how much screen time Emma gets, especially on devices like smartphones. A few months ago, we actually had a discussion about when Emma should be allowed a phone, and I expressed that I didn't think she was ready yet. My ex seemed to agree at the time, but I guess he changed his mind without consulting me.

I was worried about how the phone would affect Emma's focus on school, her sleep schedule, and even her social interactions. I also felt blindsided by my ex making such a big decision without even giving me a heads-up. So, after Emma went to bed, I took the phone away and explained to her the next morning that she wouldn't be keeping it. I told her it wasn't a punishment, but rather a delay until she was more mature and we could establish some ground rules together.

Emma was understandably upset and said that her dad gave it to her as a gift and she should be allowed to keep it. She even accused me of being unfair and ruining her excitement. When I spoke to my ex about it, he was furious. He said that I overstepped and ruined a special moment he wanted to share with his daughter. He argued that he had every right to give her the phone, especially since it was his own money.

Even some of my friends think I might have overreacted and should have simply set boundaries around the phone's usage instead of taking it away altogether. They believe I'm being too controlling and that I should have had a more cooperative approach with my ex.

I still think I was justified. We are co-parents, and such a big decision should have been made together. But now I'm questioning if I handled the situation poorly. 

So, AITA for taking away my 11-year-old's new phone after her dad bought it for her?","I've (30) been married for 6 years to a great guy (33) and we have a sweet 11-year-old daughter named Mia. My ex-husband (from a previous marriage) has always been somewhat distant, but we've managed to keep a good relationship for Mia's sake. Lately, he's been trying to be more involved, and I've been trying to make it work for Mia's benefit.

Last weekend, my ex-husband surprised Mia with a brand new phone, which I had previously told her she wasn't ready for. We've been talking about it for months, and I was planning to get her a more basic phone for her birthday in a few weeks. I was a bit disappointed, but I wanted to make the most of the situation.

However, things quickly took a turn when Mia started using the phone excessively, constantly texting her friends and playing games. I set some boundaries and rules, but she didn't listen. We had multiple conversations about responsible phone use, but she continued to disregard them.

Yesterday, I found out that she was texting her dad at midnight, and when I asked her about it, she said it was because he had promised her a new game if she got to level 10. I took away the phone, and my ex-husband got upset, saying I was being too strict and that I should have talked to him about it first.

He's been messaging me nonstop, saying I'm being overbearing and that I should give Mia back the phone. He claims that I'm not giving him any chance to be a good father and that I'm ruining Mia's relationship with him. I feel like I'm being reasonable, setting boundaries and teaching Mia responsibility.

Now, I'm feeling anxious about how this is going to affect our family dynamics.

My ex seemed to agree at the time, but I guess he changed his mind without consulting me.\n\nI was worried about how the phone would affect Emma's focus on school, her sleep schedule, and even her social interactions. I also felt blindsided by my ex making such a big decision without even giving me a heads-up. So, after Emma went to bed, I took the phone away and explained to her the next morning that she wouldn't be keeping it. I told her it wasn't a punishment, but rather a delay until she was more mature and we could establish some ground rules together.\n\nEmma was understandably upset and said that her dad gave it to her as a gift and she should be allowed to keep it. She even accused me of being unfair and ruining her excitement. When I spoke to my ex about it, he was furious. He said that I overstepped and ruined a special moment he wanted to share with his daughter. He argued that he had every right to give her the phone, especially since it was his own money.\n\nEven some of my friends think I might have overreacted and should have simply set boundaries around the phone's usage instead of taking it away altogether. They believe I'm being too controlling and that I should have had a more cooperative approach with my ex.\n\nI still think I was justified. We are co-parents, and such a big decision should have been made together. But now I'm questioning if I handled the situation poorly. \n\nSo, AITA for taking away my 11-year-old's new phone after her dad bought it for her?""}]","{

Jake has a son, Tyler (8M), from a previous relationship. Tyler is a great kid, and I really love spending time with him. However, I recently went through a tough time; I lost my mom a few months ago, and the grief has been pretty overwhelming.

As Tyler's birthday approached, Jake and I talked about how to celebrate. Jake wanted to make it a big day for Tyler, which I totally understood. He planned a party with tons of friends, a magician, and all the usual birthday fun. I was excited for Tyler, but the thought of a big celebration just made me feel heavy with my own grief. 

The day of the party came, and I really tried to put my feelings aside for Tyler. I helped set up decorations and baked a cake, but when the party started and I saw all of Tyler's friends running around, I felt incredibly out of place. I watched Jake bonding with Tyler and engaging in all the fun, while I couldn't shake the sadness I was feeling from my loss. 

Eventually, during the party, I stepped outside for a bit to collect my thoughts. I felt like I was intruding on a happy moment that I just couldn't fully be a part of. I didn’t want to bring anyone down, so I kept it to myself and returned to the party. But throughout the day, I just felt more and more like a ghost in the background.

Later, after the party, Jake noticed I seemed down and asked if I was okay. I ended up sharing my feelings about feeling left out and how hard it was for me to be in such a joyful environment when I was still grieving. Jake was really understanding and said he never meant for me to feel that way. He mentioned he just wanted to make Tyler's day special. 

Some friends of mine said I should have been more vocal about my feelings beforehand, but I didn’t want to ruin Tyler’s day or bring my grief into the celebration. I just couldn’t handle it without feeling guilty. 

In the end, I don’t want to be a burden in this relationship or to Tyler, but I also don’t want to feel invisible. Am I the asshole for feeling left out during his birthday celebration while I’m struggling with my own grief?","My boyfriend (32M) and I (28F) have been together for a little over a year. He has a son (7M) from a previous relationship, and I've grown to care for the little guy a lot. Recently, his son's birthday came up, and my boyfriend planned a big celebration with his ex-wife, family, and close friends. He wanted it to be special and memorable for his son, which is something I completely understand and appreciate.

However, my own family has been going through a really tough time. My grandmother, who I was extremely close to, passed away just a week before the birthday celebration. I've been dealing with a lot of grief and sadness, and honestly, I was feeling pretty low. My boyfriend knew about my grandma’s passing and has been supportive in his own way.

When the birthday party was being planned, my boyfriend asked if I wanted to be involved, but I felt like I was being more of a burden in my current state. The day of the celebration, I decided to join them for a bit, attempting to be there despite my grief. But it turned out to be much harder than I anticipated. Surrounded by laughter and joy while I was still mourning made me feel out of place, and I ended up leaving early to avoid breaking down in front of everyone.

Afterwards, my boyfriend tried to console me, acknowledging how hard it must have been for me. He felt bad that I couldn’t fully participate and enjoy the day. Meanwhile, his son didn’t really notice my absence much, as he was having a great time with his friends and family.

My boyfriend’s ex-wife also reached out, thanking me for coming even for a short while and expressed her condolences, which was really kind of her. My boyfriend's family has also been very understanding, but I can’t help but feel like I let everyone down by not being fully present. I wanted to be there to support my boyfriend and his son, but my grief was too overwhelming.

Everyone around me has been supportive, yet I still feel guilty and left out. My boyfriend assures me that it’s okay, but I can't shake off this feeling. Am I the asshole for struggling with my grief and feeling left out of a celebration that I couldn't fully participate in?","This is a throwaway.

My boyfriend (35M) and I have been together for 4 years. He has a 9-year-old son from a previous relationship, and we've been a family unit for most of that time. However, about 6 months ago, his ex-wife (my boyfriend's son's mom) left him for another guy, and my boyfriend and I have been trying to help his son through the emotional fallout. It's been tough, but we're trying to be supportive.

This weekend was his son's birthday, and my boyfriend and I were both looking forward to celebrating. But things got complicated when his ex-wife asked if she could take their son to her new boyfriend's house for a big birthday party with all of his friends. My boyfriend felt obligated to let her take him, saying that it was the best thing for their son's emotional well-being. I was really hurt and felt left out, but I tried to be understanding.

However, things took a turn for the worse when his ex-wife sent me a text saying that she was glad I was willing to let her take their son to the party, implying that I was being selfless and understanding. Meanwhile, I was feeling really down and struggling to deal with my own grief from losing a loved one a few months ago. I wasn't in the right headspace to celebrate someone else's birthday, and I felt like my boyfriend was prioritizing his son's happiness over mine.

I expressed my feelings to my boyfriend, and he said that I was being ""dramatic"" and that I should be happy for their son's birthday. He also said that I was being selfish for expecting him to spend the day with me. I feel like he's not getting it – I'm not just feeling left out, I'm struggling to cope with my own pain and feeling like I'm not being prioritized.

I know that my boyfriend is trying to be a good parent to his son, but it feels like he's choosing his son over me right now. Am I the asshole for feeling hurt and left out when my boyfriend prioritized his son's birthday over mine?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""My boyfriend (32M) and I (28F) have been together for a little over a year.

So, I (29F) have been married to my husband, Jake (30M), for about three years now. Recently, we decided to open our relationship up, and it’s been going pretty well for us. We have established boundaries and are both happy with the arrangement. However, I’ve been grappling with something that’s been bothering me lately.

We have a mutual friend, Sam (31M), who’s been really supportive of our relationship, but he has no idea that we’re in an open marriage. I’ve noticed that Sam often engages in conversations with Jake about relationships, love, and even marriage, and he often refers to Jake and me as “the perfect couple.” This is where I start to feel a bit uneasy.

I think it’s important for Sam to know about our open relationship because it shapes how we navigate our lives, and I feel like it’s a piece of information that could help him understand our situation better. Jake, however, is more hesitant. He thinks that it’s not really Sam’s business, and he doesn’t want to complicate things or make Sam uncomfortable. They’ve been friends for years, and he doesn’t want to jeopardize that friendship.

I’ve tried to explain my perspective to Jake, saying that if Sam is going to discuss relationships with us and is under the impression that we are traditional, it feels a bit deceptive. I believe it's vital to be honest with our friends about significant aspects of our lives, especially when it directly affects how we interact.

After our discussions, Jake still feels strongly about not disclosing our relationship status, and I can see that he’s torn between my feelings and his comfort level. Sam has been nothing but understanding and supportive of us, and I don’t think he would judge us harshly, but Jake disagrees and feels it could change how Sam sees our relationship.

So now I’m left wondering if I’m being unreasonable for wanting Jake to share this part of our lives with Sam, or if Jake is justified in wanting to keep it to ourselves. Am I the asshole for thinking my husband should have this conversation with our friend?","My husband (34M) and I (32F) have been married for five years and in an open relationship for the past two. We've always been very transparent with each other and anyone we get involved with about our arrangement. Recently, a new friend entered the picture, and this situation has me questioning whether I am in the wrong.

There’s this woman, let's call her Sara (30F), who recently joined our friend group. She’s smart, funny, and has quickly become a good friend to both of us. My husband and Sara have been hanging out a lot lately, and it's clear she has developed a crush on him. I'm perfectly okay with this, and so is my husband. Given our open relationship, stuff like this isn't a big deal as long as everyone is honest and respectful.

The problem is, Sara has no idea that we're in an open relationship. She knows we're married, but my husband hasn't told her about our arrangement. I feel like this is important information for her to know before things potentially go any further between them. I don’t think it’s fair for her to develop deeper feelings for him without knowing the full context of our marriage. 

I brought this up to my husband, and he gets where I’m coming from, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to bring it up unless things actually start to get serious between him and Sara. He feels like it might complicate things needlessly, and he doesn’t want to scare her off or make her think we're weird. He’s also worried it may cause drama in our friend group.

Our friends who know about our open relationship have mixed opinions. Some think like me and believe honesty is the best policy right from the start, while others side with my husband and think it’s not a big deal unless it becomes serious.

Right now, Sara is still in the dark about the true nature of our marriage. My husband and I haven’t had major conflicts over this, but I’m still uneasy about the whole thing. Am I the asshole for thinking my husband should tell Sara about our open relationship sooner rather than later?","I (28F) have been in an open relationship with my husband (30M) for about 2 years now, and things have been going great. We've been honest with each other about our boundaries and have been respectful of each other's needs. We've even had a few friends who are also in open relationships, and it's been really liberating to be able to communicate openly with them about our desires and limits.

Recently, we met a new friend through a mutual acquaintance. We've hung out a few times, and she seems really cool, but I've noticed that she keeps asking about our relationship status. At first, my husband and I were both evasive, but I think it's time to be more open and honest with her. The thing is, my husband doesn't want to tell her that we're in an open relationship. He's worried that she'll judge us or think we're weird, and he's been pretty secretive about it.

I think this is a major red flag in our relationship, and I feel like I'm being dishonest with our friend by not being upfront about our relationship status. I've tried talking to my husband about it, but he just says that he's not ready to ""label"" our relationship and that it's not anyone else's business.

I'm starting to feel like my husband is hiding something from me, and it's making me feel really uncomfortable. I think I would feel more comfortable if he just told our friend the truth, but I'm not sure if I'm being too pushy. WIBTA if I confront him about being more open with our friend about our relationship status?

It's worth noting that our friend is someone who we've been hanging out with regularly, and I feel like she deserves to know the truth about our relationship. I don't want to be dishonest with her or lead her on, but I also don't want to create any unnecessary drama or tension in our friendship.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""My husband (34M) and I (32F) have been married for five years and in an open relationship for the past two.

I have not yet seen him interact with other dogs due to this.\nI tend to walk him at night around 9 or 10 pm as there’s usually no one outside at this time, so I don’t have to try to dodge all the other dogs being walked in the neighborhood. \n\nMy dog was on a leash, we were walking at a brisk pace and as we turned a corner, to my surprise we nearly ran into another couple walking their small chihuahua-like dog. My dog LUNGED for their dog with a speed and ferocity that caught me off guard, the leash slipped from my hands and my dog attacked their dog. My dog is a good sized boxer/lab mix (although he could just be a pitbull mix and the rescue listed him as a boxer/lab to help with his adoption chances) and I feared he would legitimately kill the other dog. It was awful, we were all screaming, I managed to grab the leash and drag my dog away but some damage had definitely been done. \nI exchanged contact info with the owners and they rushed him to the ER. I originally wanted to do the right thing and help pay for medical bills. I live in a high COL area and I figured it would be expensive, but they let me know the estimated cost to save their dog is at nearly twenty thousand dollars so far. And it could potentially increase.\n\nI did not believe them at first, but they forwarded the estimate bill to me and offered to bring me to the hospital to see for myself. The price quote is real. The dog has broken ribs and is oxygen dependent, they want to give him at least one blood transfusion and hospitalise for several days. \n\nThere is no world in which I can afford that. That’s ridiculous. I said I would pay for euthanasia or contribute 5k towards the bill. They argued with me saying it is my fault, which is true, but that amount is outlandish.

About six months ago, Sara started having difficulties with her mental health. I completely understand that mental health struggles can be incredibly tough, and I’ve been there to lend a listening ear and support her as best I can. 

However, things started to change when she began to withdraw from our friend group and consistently cancel plans at the last minute. We would plan outings, and she’d either ghost us or come up with an excuse that felt flimsy. It’s not that I don’t sympathize; I know how hard it must be for her. But it began to feel like she was using her struggles as an excuse to opt out of responsibilities, and it was frustrating me and our other friends.

A few weeks ago, during dinner with a couple of mutual friends, I brought up Sara's behavior. I expressed my concern and how it felt like a burden to keep adjusting our plans around her last-minute cancellations. I thought we could brainstorm ways to support her better, but instead, the conversation turned into gossip. We started sharing our frustrations and doubts about whether she truly wanted help or if her mental health was being used as a crutch. I knew it wasn’t right, and part of me felt guilty, but I also felt overwhelmed and wanted to vent.

Afterward, one of our friends texted Sara to check in, and during their chat, she mentioned our conversation. Sara was devastated. She reached out to me, expressing how hurt she was and feeling betrayed that I would say those things about her. I felt terrible, but I also felt like I wasn’t completely wrong to voice my feelings. Now, our friend group is kind of split: some friends think I was justified in expressing my frustrations, while others feel I should have kept my mouth shut.

Now, I’m questioning if I went too far. Did I cross a line in my judgment of Sara’s situation when all she needed was support? AITA for judging and gossiping about a friend who's struggling with mental health?","So, I (28F) have a close-knit group of friends from college. We’ve all been through a lot together, and I consider them to be like family. One of my friends, Emily (29F), has been struggling with mental health issues over the past year. She’s been seeing a therapist and has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety.

Recently, Emily has been acting more withdrawn and has been missing out on our regular hangouts. She’s been cancelling plans last minute and isn’t as responsive in our group chat as she used to be. A couple of weeks ago, she skipped one of our friend’s birthdays, which really upset the birthday girl. This led to a heated discussion between a few of us about Emily’s behavior. 

I admit, I was frustrated. We’ve all been trying to be supportive, but it feels like she’s always making excuses and not putting in any effort to maintain the friendships. During this conversation, I ended up sharing some of my concerns about her actions and even speculated a bit about her therapy sessions and the progress she might be making, or lack thereof. I said something along the lines of, “How long can we keep making excuses for her? She needs to get it together.”

Word got back to Emily about what I said. She confronted me, obviously hurt and feeling betrayed. She said that she thought she could trust me and that my comments made her feel even worse about herself. I tried to apologize and explain that I was speaking out of frustration, but she wasn’t having it. Now, the rest of the group is divided. Some think I overstepped and was too harsh, while others agree that Emily needs to step up and take responsibility for her behavior.

Emily has been even more distant since the incident. She’s barely responding to messages and hasn’t come to any gatherings. I feel guilty because I didn’t mean to hurt her. I was just venting and trying to understand what’s going on with her. But now it seems like I might have pushed her further away.

Am I the asshole for judging and gossiping about a friend who’s struggling with mental health?","I've been friends with Sarah for years. We've been through a lot together, including her struggles with anxiety and depression. I've been there for her through countless therapy sessions, hospital stays, and medication changes. She's been open with me about her struggles, and I've made it a point to be supportive and understanding. 

Recently, I noticed that Sarah had been acting strange. She'd cancel plans at the last minute, seem distant during conversations, and would often lash out at me for no reason. I brought it up with her, and she confessed that she'd been having a tough time lately. She said she'd been struggling with suicidal thoughts and was seeing a new therapist. I was shocked and worried, but I tried to be supportive. I offered to help her with errands, cook her meals, and even offered to drive her to therapy sessions. 

However, as time went on, I started to notice that Sarah was only sharing parts of her struggles with me. She'd tell me about her bad days, but never about the good ones. I started to feel like I was only seeing half the picture, and it was affecting our friendship. I also started to notice that Sarah was making some questionable decisions, like taking on too much work and spending too much money. I'd try to offer advice, but she'd brush it off, saying that she was ""fine"" and that I just didn't understand. 

One day, I was talking to our mutual friend, Emily, and I mentioned that Sarah was struggling with mental health issues. Emily said that she'd noticed it too and that Sarah had been complaining about me being too controlling and nosy. I was taken aback. I felt like Sarah had been using her struggles as an excuse to avoid dealing with our friendship issues. I started to wonder if Sarah was genuinely struggling or if she was just using it as a way to get attention and sympathy. 

I know that judging and gossiping about Sarah's mental health struggles is not okay. But I feel like I'm being left in the dark and that Sarah is only showing me the parts of her life that she wants me to see. I've been trying to be supportive, but it feels like Sarah is taking advantage of my good nature.

85,AITA for pranking my brother,"The title is really oversimplified, just a heads up.   I (M18) have spent the past three ish years living with my dad's ex (lets call her Jane) (she's not my mom, her and my dad were together way before I was born) because I was pretty sick ahd her family's incredibly rich and has like a million doctors so they could give me better access to better treatment. The original plan was that I would just go with her family and my dad would join me afterwards once he got work stuff sorted, but the pandemic  got in the way and made it harder for my dad to join me afterwards since I am immunocompromised and he wasn't in a position to be isolated with me. I'd rather not go too much into the specifics of it all but what you need to know is that I hadn't seen my dad in person for over a year before this week.  During the period of time that I was gone, my dad took in a different kid (M16) since he's registered as a foster parent. Since then, he's adopted the kid. And I had a lot of differing emotions over it when I first found out, and also a lot of time to sit with them. I've spoken to him over the phone a couple of times, but never in person.    Anyways, I got the news that I would finally be able to go home a little while ago, and decided that I would surprise my dad (and new brother) with it. It's not entirely a surprise in the sense that my dad was aware I've been getting better and would be getting home sometime late October/early November, it's just a surprise in the sense that he wouldn't know the exact moment I'd get home. So, Jane agreed to help me arrange it and all, and I ended up deciding I'd prank my brother when I got there. Nothing too bad, just make him think the house is a little haunted before revealing myself. He'd mentioned that the house *felt* like it should have a ghost or two, so I found it fitting.   I did just that yesterday, and it was pretty fun. I got to finally meet my brother and actually prank him in the process, which I thought was normal brother stuff? IDK, never had a brother before. But IDK, I suppose he was more spooked than intended cause my dad's reaction upon seeing me was just to scold me for ""trying to run off"" the kid. Not my intention at all, but yeah, was told it just made it seem like I wanted him gone.   And, listen, okay, maybe a prank wasn't the best first impression, but I really don't think it's a big enough deal that I don't even get a welcome here, you know?

My dad, who recently remarried, now has a 12-year-old son (let's call him Jake) from his new wife. I haven't had the chance to bond with Jake since I was away, so I wanted to make a memorable return.

Knowing that my dad has a pretty good sense of humor, I decided to pull a harmless prank on him and Jake to break the ice. I told them I was in a secret competition for a scholarship and needed them to help me practice my ""acting skills."" I created a fake audition script and told them that the key to succeeding was to act like we were all in a horror movie.

I set the scene by dimming the lights and telling them I needed them to react as if they were scared by an ""unexpected twist."" I even had a friend record everything on my phone to capture their reactions. My dad was in on the joke initially but seemed a bit nervous, while Jake was super excited. We did a few takes, and I thought we were all just having fun.

However, things took a turn when Jake couldn’t quite get into the spirit of the prank. He started yelling, and my dad, trying to calm him down, ended up flipping out too when he thought Jake was genuinely scared. They both ended up really upset when they realized it was just a prank. My dad told me I crossed a line, and Jake was in tears, saying he thought I was serious.

After I explained it was all meant to be silly, my dad still insisted I shouldn't have done that. Now, there’s a weird tension in the house, and I feel guilty for what happened. Some friends think it was all in good fun, while others say I should’ve considered their feelings more.

So, AITA for pulling a prank on my dad and Jake after being away for a year?","I (18F) recently came back home after spending a year abroad as an exchange student. My dad (50M) remarried during that time, and his new wife has a 10-year-old son, Tom. I hadn't met them in person before returning. I was excited to come back and thought it would be fun to break the ice with a prank. I realize now that might not have been the best idea.

When I got home, I decided to do something quirky. I pretended to be a ghost, dressing in a white sheet and planning to pop out when they least expected it. My dad, his wife, and Tom had no idea I was already home since I arrived a day earlier than planned. 

As they were watching TV that evening, I jumped out from behind the couch with my ghost costume and yelled, ""Boo!"" Tom screamed and ran out of the room crying. My dad and his wife were stunned. After a few moments, my dad realized it was me and his expression turned from shock to anger.

His wife comforted Tom while my dad pulled me aside. He was furious and said that the prank was completely inappropriate and inconsiderate, especially since Tom is already having a hard time adjusting to all the changes. He went on to say that it was a childish and poor way to introduce myself to my new family. Later, Tom refused to come out of his room, and his mom was visibly upset.

I felt bad and tried to apologize, but Tom wouldn't talk to me and my dad was still mad. My friends think it was just harmless fun and that my dad is overreacting, but I can see their point too.

Since then, the atmosphere at home has been really tense. I definitely didn't mean to scare Tom that badly, and I didn't anticipate my dad and his wife being so upset. I just wanted to do something memorable and fun, but it clearly backfired.

I've been thinking about what I did and started questioning if I made a huge mistake. So, am I the asshole for pulling that prank on my dad and new brother after being away for a year?","My dad got married a year ago and I was super close to my dad before his wife and her kid came into the picture. I've been away for a year working overseas, and I've been really anxious about coming back and seeing my family. I've been thinking about pulling a prank on my dad and his new stepson, my ""brother"" I guess, just to lighten the mood and remind them that I'm back in the picture.

I decided to sneak into their house while they were asleep and switch their alarm clocks to play a super loud, obnoxious rendition of ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" instead of their usual morning alarms. I also replaced my dad's toothbrush with a fake one that looked identical but had a big, fake spider glued to it.

I waited until the next morning to see the looks on their faces when they woke up to the loud music and saw the fake spider on my dad's toothbrush. I was hiding behind the couch, trying not to laugh, and my dad came running out of the bathroom looking like he'd just seen a ghost.

The next day, my brother came up to me and told me that my dad was still freaking out about the prank and that he'd found the fake spider on his toothbrush. My brother also told me that my dad is considering taking away my phone privileges for a month because of the prank.

My friends think I'm a jerk for pulling the prank, but I just wanted to have some fun and remind my family that I'm back. I feel like they've been ignoring me since my dad got married and I'm trying to get my old spot back in the family.

I know it was a pretty mean prank, but I'm not sure if I'm the asshole for doing it.

I got a text from my friend asking if I wanted to go roller skating on Friday at 7 the game starts around 5:30-6 and it’s about a half hour drive so I would have ti leave at 6:30. Since they live a little farther away I don’t see them very often and I enjoy seeing them when I can. They do go roller skating somewhat often but they haven’t gone the past couple weeks do to planning issues and people not being available. Now here is where I want your guys opinion, my mom thinks I’m being selfish for saying I would go to my uncles and then taking other plans which I still want to go and see everyone but I would leave pretty early on. I feel like it’s not that big of a deal considering I’m still going and I’m going to other events plus I never miss big family events. I love my family and of course I want to spend time with them and I haven’t made a full decision yet I just want to know if I’m being a jerk.

These events are usually filled with laughter, food, and a lot of family bonding time, which I genuinely enjoy. However, I also have a group of friends who I've been roller skating with for years now—it's a passion of mine and usually the highlight of my week.

Last weekend, we had a family reunion planned at my parents’ house. I had committed to going, of course, but when I checked with my friends, they planned a roller skating night at a local rink, and it was one of the rare occasions where all of them could make it. I was torn because both events were important to me, but the skate night was something I had been looking forward to for a while.

As the family event went on, things were fun but also starting to drag on a bit, and I couldn't shake the excitement of skating. Eventually, I made the decision to leave the family gathering early, about two hours before it was set to end, to meet up with my friends. I texted my mom as I was leaving to let her know I had to go—figured it was better than just disappearing.

When I arrived at the rink, I was ecstatic to see my friends and immediately jumped into the fun. But I did receive a text from my sister saying that my parents were upset with me for leaving early. Apparently, they expected me to stay longer and help with clean-up and just enjoy the family time together. I didn’t realize how much it would bother them, but it seems like they felt I chose my friends over family.

Now my parents are giving me a hard time about it, saying I need to prioritize family events more and that they felt hurt I didn't stay longer. My friends think it’s silly that they are upset, suggesting that I should be able to balance both without guilt.

I genuinely thought it was okay to leave early since I had already spent a good portion of the time with my family, but I can see why they might feel hurt. AITA for leaving family events early to go roller skating with friends?","I’ve always loved roller skating. It’s been my passion since I was a kid, and I never outgrew it. Recently, my friends and I formed a small roller skating club, and we meet every Friday evening. It’s the highlight of my week, and I genuinely look forward to it. 

However, my family has a tradition of having family dinners every Friday night. It’s a time when everyone gathers, catches up, and enjoys each other's company. I value these dinners, but ever since my skating club started, I’ve been leaving these events early to make it to our skating sessions on time. 

Last Friday, during our family dinner, I announced that I’d be leaving early to meet my friends. My parents were visibly upset, and my sister flat-out told me I was being selfish. She argued that family time should come first, especially since it’s only once a week and that I could skate any other time. My mom joined in and said that she misses having me around for the entirety of the dinners, and my dad just shook his head in disappointment.

I tried to explain how much roller skating means to me and how it’s a commitment I’ve made to my friends as well. But the argument turned into a pretty heated discussion. My cousin chimed in and said that it’s all about finding balance and that I’m tipping the scales too much in favor of my hobby over family.

Since then, there’s been some awkwardness. My sister is still giving me the cold shoulder, and my parents have been distant. My friends, on the other hand, think I’m not doing anything wrong and support my decision to pursue my passion. They even suggested I try to get my family to understand how important this is to me.

I’m now second-guessing my choices. I don’t want to hurt my family, but I also don’t want to give up roller skating. The tension is getting to me, and I feel stuck. 

So, AITA for leaving family events early to go roller skating with friends?","So I'm a 25-year-old who's been living with my family for a bit longer than I'd like to admit. We all get along pretty well, but there's a lot of passive-aggressive behavior that goes on behind closed doors. My mom's always trying to control everyone's lives and decisions, and it can be suffocating at times. 

Recently, my mom invited the whole family to a cousin's birthday party. It's not like I'm close with my cousin or anything, but I figured I'd just go to be nice. However, a week prior to the party, my friends invited me to join them for a roller skating event at a local rink. I've been looking forward to it for weeks, and it's something I really enjoy doing with my friends. I told them I'd make sure to be there.

Fast forward to the day of the party. I arrive, and it's just as I expected – awkward, forced small talk, and my mom trying to guilt trip me into staying. But I had already told my friends I'd be there, and I didn't want to bail on them. I made an excuse about needing to leave early to get some ""fresh air"" and told my family I was going to take a walk. I then met up with my friends at the roller skating rink, and we had an amazing time.

When I got home, my family was all upset with me for leaving the party early. My mom said I was being selfish and that I should have prioritized the family event over my ""frivolous"" plans with friends. My siblings were all mad at me too, saying I was being inconsiderate. But honestly, I felt like I was being true to myself and doing something I really enjoyed. I didn't feel like I was being hurtful or thoughtless towards anyone, but I guess that's not how they saw it.

Now my family's all giving me the cold shoulder, and I'm starting to feel like I did something wrong. But at the same time, I'm thinking, ""Wait a minute, I did what made me happy, and that's what matters, right?""

87,AITA for taking my daughters “emotional support” dog back to the shelter?,"My daughter is 17. I’m 47. My wife is 44. My daughter had been having problems with her anxiety and depression, school had been very hard for her and she asked us if she could get an animal for “emotional support”. I asked her why we couldn’t just put her in regular therapy again but she said she didn’t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn’t want to try it again.  I was pretty against bringing an animal into the home as my daughter can barely keep her room clean and remember to wash her dishes, much less take care of an animal. And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog because I work long hours and didn’t want to be picking up messes when I got home. My wife said I was being unfair and that this could be what my daughter needed to get back in good spirits.  So we got her a dog. We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care (such as frequent grooming and other traits) and I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference.   The dog was great at first and it got along with my daughter and wife greatly. Me not so much, but it could probably sense I didn’t really like it either. But then it started getting out of its leash on walks, tearing up the couch and various other toys we bought it. My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I’d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet.   I warned her twice that if she didn’t start taking responsibility that the dog would be going back and she gave me excuses saying she was feeling depressed again. She said she would do better, but didn’t. Ultimately, I got fed up so one day when she went to school I loaded the dog in my truck and told the shelter he wasn’t a good fit for us.  Obviously when she came home she was upset. She was saying the dog was her best friend but I told her that she wasn’t taking very good care of him, and he didn’t deserve that. Wife says it was very harsh to just take the dog back while she was gone, but she agrees daughter wasn’t responsible. My daughter has been saying I brought back her severe depression and we haven’t been talking.  AITA?",ESH,"Judgement: ESH, Post: My daughter is 17. I’m 47. My wife is 44.

We get along pretty well and have never had any problems. \n\nAs part of our renters agreement with the landlord, we're only allowed one guest over at a time for a week max with the consent of the other roommate. So if I want to have a friend stay with me for a few days, my roommate has to agree and vice versa. We both have had friends over before and it's always gone over peacefully. We both also have had more than one friend over with no issues because we respected eachother's space and belongings. It's important to note here that I've only ever invited over other women, and he's only ever invited over other men. Our guests also stay in our own bedrooms.\n\n\nThree weeks ago, one of my friends, Mike (22M) needed a place to stay for three days because he was leaving an abusive partner. I asked my roommate if it was alright to have him over for those three days. I explained the sensitivity of the situation and I promised, as always, to cover any extra expenses caused by Mike being over. My roommate refused because he said he didn't feel comfortable with a man being invited over. I had no clue what he was talking about it and I was very annoyed, but I respected his choice. My friends and I put money together to get Mike a hotel room for those three days instead. \n\n\nToday, my roommate asked if he could have two friends over for Friday and the Weekend. I said no because it was against the renters rules. He was confused because we've both agreed to break the rules before, but I said to him that I didn't feel comfortable with two strange men over. He could tell straight away that I was doing it to annoy him because he didn't let Mike stay over, plus I have met the friends he was inviting over before. He told me to stop being childish because he has a right to refuse guests for being uncomfortable whereas I was doing it to be annoying. What's even more irritating is that he has met Mike before and they get along with eachother. He then said he'd invite them over anyway but I said I'd call the landlord if he did so. We got into an argument and he called me an asshole for threatening to call the landlord over this.

AITA?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: ESH, Title: 'AITA for Taking Away My Daughter's Emotional Support Dog Due to Her Lack of Responsibility?'""}]","I (42F) have a daughter, Emily (14F), who has an emotional support dog named Buddy. We got Buddy about a year ago to help Emily manage her anxiety and depression, and he’s been a wonderful companion for her. However, over time, I've noticed that Emily hasn't been taking the responsibility of caring for Buddy as she should. 

At first, she was great with him—walking him, feeding him, and training him. But lately, it's become increasingly apparent that I’ve been doing most of the work. She often forgets to feed him, leaves him alone for long stretches while she’s at friends' houses, and doesn’t take him for walks unless I remind her. I’ve talked to her multiple times about the importance of caring for Buddy and discussed that having a dog comes with responsibilities. Each time, she promised to do better, but nothing has changed.

A week ago, things reached a breaking point when I came home from work to find Buddy sitting in his cage, hungry and needing a walk. Emily had gone to a friend’s house after school and hadn’t bothered to check on him or even leave food. I was really upset and confronted her about it. She got defensive and insisted that I was being too harsh and that it wasn’t a big deal. In a moment of frustration, I made the decision to take Buddy away and explained that until she could prove she was responsible enough to care for him, he would stay with my sister, who has a more stable environment. 

Emily was devastated and cried for days. She says I don’t understand how much she needs Buddy and that I’ve betrayed her trust. I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing—if she can’t take care of him, then Buddy deserves a better situation. However, I also feel guilty about how I went about it and whether I should have given her one more chance.

My friends and family are divided. Some say I was right to take Buddy away; she needs to learn responsibility. Others think I should have handled it differently, perhaps by seeking a compromise or a different way to motivate her. 

So, am I the asshole for taking away my daughter's emotional support dog due to her lack of responsibility? ","I (45M) have a 16-year-old daughter, Emily, who has been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few years. About a year ago, after discussing it with her therapist, we decided to get an emotional support dog, Charlie, to help her cope. Charlie has been a great addition to the family and has really made a positive impact on Emily's mental health.

However, there have been growing issues with Emily's responsibility when it comes to taking care of Charlie. We agreed from the start that Emily would be the primary caregiver—feeding him, walking him, and ensuring he gets the attention he needs. Over the past few months, Emily has repeatedly neglected these responsibilities. I've found myself constantly reminding her to feed Charlie or take him for walks. On numerous occasions, I've had to step in and take care of him myself to make sure he's not being neglected.

Last week was the tipping point for me. Emily had forgotten to feed Charlie for an entire day and he was clearly hungry and distressed. I sat her down and had a serious conversation about her neglect and emphasized how unfair it was to Charlie. She promised to be better, but the very next day, she forgot to take him for a walk, despite my reminders.

Feeling like I had no other choice, I decided to take Charlie away temporarily and have him stay with my sister. I explained to Emily that until she proves she can be responsible and take care of Charlie properly, he would stay with my sister. Emily was devastated and accused me of being heartless and not understanding how much she needed Charlie.

My wife thinks I might have been too harsh and that I should have given Emily more chances. On the other hand, my sister agrees with my decision, saying it's important for Emily to learn responsibility. Emily's therapist is also concerned and suggested that removing Charlie might do more harm than good for Emily's mental health.

Now, Emily is even more withdrawn and refuses to talk to me, and it's created a lot of tension in the house. I feel stuck between wanting to teach her a lesson in responsibility and not wanting to further harm her mental health.

So, AITA for taking away my daughter's emotional support dog due to her lack of responsibility?","I (32F) have a 10-year-old daughter (10F) who has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. As part of her therapy, we got her an Emotional Support Dog (ESD), a lovely golden retriever named Max. Max has been a huge help in calming her down during anxiety attacks and has been a constant companion for her.

As time went on, however, I started to notice that Max was being taken care of poorly by my daughter. She would forget to feed him, leave his food and water bowls dirty, and sometimes even forget to let him outside. I've also noticed that she's been using Max as an excuse to avoid doing her homework or chores. 

I've talked to her multiple times about taking better care of Max, but nothing seems to change. I've even offered to take over some of the responsibilities, but she gets upset and says I'm taking away her independence.

Last week, I had to take Max to the vet because he had gotten into some trash and eaten a bunch of garbage. The vet told me that if we didn't get Max's diet and living situation under control, it could lead to serious health problems for the dog. That's when I made the decision to take Max away from my daughter. I know it sounds harsh, but I feel like I have no choice.

My daughter is devastated, and my partner (who is a bit of a softie) is saying that I'm being too harsh and that we should have found other solutions. My daughter's therapist is also saying that taking away Max might not be the best idea, but I'm not sure what else to do. 

The problem is, I feel like my daughter is not taking her responsibilities seriously and is using Max as a crutch. I don't want to be the ""bad guy,"" but I also don't want Max to suffer because of my daughter's lack of responsibility.

She then told me that I forfeited the right to the ticket when I left her hanging and that she had to bring her mom so she didn’t have to miss the concert.

WIBTA?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Expecting a Friend to Pay Me Back for a Concert Ticket I Let Her Use?'""}]","A few weeks ago, I had a friend, let’s call her Sarah, who expressed interest in going to a concert with me. I had purchased an extra ticket since I wasn't sure she was going to be able to afford it. I agreed to let her use it, hoping it would be a fun night for both of us. We’ve been friends for a couple of years and have done a lot together, so I didn't mind fronting the ticket cost.

The night of the concert, Sarah had an amazing time, which I was thrilled about. However, after the concert, when I casually mentioned getting reimbursed for the ticket, she responded with disbelief. She thought I was joking and that the ticket was a gift. I assumed she would understand that letting her use the ticket meant she was going to pay me back, especially since I had already been quite accommodating.

When I pressed the issue a bit more, she got defensive and started saying things like, “You’re my friend; you shouldn't expect me to pay you back for that.” This left me feeling really frustrated. I mean, I wouldn’t ask her to pay me back if I hadn’t spent my own money upfront. Other friends chimed in, and some agreed with her perspective that friends don’t charge each other for things like that, while others sided with me, stating that it’s just common courtesy to pay back borrowed money.

Now, there’s been a bit of tension between us since that night. I genuinely care about her, but I just feel like she’s taking advantage of our friendship. I want to maintain our friendship, but I also believe I shouldn’t have to feel guilty for expecting her to reimburse me for something I paid for.

So, Reddit, AITA for expecting a friend to pay me back for a concert ticket I let her use?","Several months ago, a group of us bought tickets to see our favorite band live. It was supposed to be an amazing night, but unfortunately, one of our friends, Emily, couldn't make it last minute due to an emergency. I had already paid for her ticket up front, which cost $150. 

Rather than let the ticket go to waste, I offered it to another friend, Sarah, who hadn't been able to get one before they sold out. Sarah eagerly accepted and used the ticket to attend the concert with us. I was happy someone could use it rather than leaving an empty seat. We had a great time. 

After the concert, I casually mentioned to Sarah that I'd appreciate it if she could pay me back for the ticket since she got to enjoy the event. Sarah looked a bit taken aback and said she thought I was just giving her the ticket because Emily couldn't go. She didn't expect to pay for it, especially since it was so last minute. 

This sparked a bit of a debate amongst our friends. Some agreed with me that it's reasonable to expect someone to pay for a concert ticket they used, especially when it costs a significant amount of money. Others sided with Sarah, saying that since I offered the ticket without mentioning repayment initially, it seemed like a kind gesture rather than a transaction. One friend pointed out that I should have clarified payment expectations upfront.

Now, a few weeks later, Sarah and I are still on speaking terms, but there's an awkward tension. She hasn't offered to pay me back, and I've been hesitant to push the issue further. My friends are split in their opinions, and it’s causing some strain on our group dynamics. 

Am I the asshole for expecting Sarah to pay me back for the concert ticket I let her use?","I (f25) have been friends with Emily (f26) for about 5 years now. We've been through thick and thin together and have always been there for each other. A few months ago, Emily reached out to me and asked if I had any extra concert tickets for a band that I had already bought tickets for. At the time, I was really looking forward to seeing them live, but I knew that Emily was a huge fan and she wouldn't have been able to afford the tickets on her own. I decided to gift her one of my tickets, which was a $100 value.

Fast forward to last weekend, when Emily finally got around to using the ticket. She texted me to let me know that she had a great time at the concert and thanked me again for the ticket. However, when I asked her when she was going to pay me back, she seemed hesitant and told me that she would ""get around to it eventually"". When I pressed her for a more specific answer, she said that she was ""short on cash right now"" and couldn't afford to pay me back yet.

This really bothered me, because I had considered the ticket a gift, but now I'm starting to feel like I was just being taken advantage of. I've known Emily long enough to know that she's not one of those people who would ever try to take advantage of me, but this situation is making me question our friendship. I'm also starting to feel a little resentful, because I've lent her money before and she's always been good about paying me back. I feel like I'm being taken for granted.

I've asked Emily again when she plans on paying me back, but she just keeps putting me off. I'm starting to feel like I'm being treated like a charity rather than a friend. Am I the asshole for expecting Emily to pay me back for the concert ticket, or is she being unreasonable for not wanting to pay me back right now?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Several months ago, a group of us bought tickets to see our favorite band live. It was supposed to be an amazing night, but unfortunately, one of our friends, Emily, couldn't make it last minute due to an emergency. I had already paid for her ticket up front, which cost $150. \n\nRather than let the ticket go to waste, I offered it to another friend, Sarah, who hadn't been able to get one before they sold out. Sarah eagerly accepted and used the ticket to attend the concert with us. I was happy someone could use it rather than leaving an empty seat. We had a great time. \n\nAfter the concert, I casually mentioned to Sarah that I'd appreciate it if she could pay me back for the ticket since she got to enjoy the event. Sarah looked a bit taken aback and said she thought I was just giving her the ticket because Emily couldn't go. She didn't expect to pay for it, especially since it was so last minute. \n\nThis sparked a bit of a debate amongst our friends. Some agreed with me that it's reasonable to expect someone to pay for a concert ticket they used, especially when it costs a significant amount of money. Others sided with Sarah, saying that since I offered the ticket without mentioning repayment initially, it seemed like a kind gesture rather than a transaction. One friend pointed out that I should have clarified payment expectations upfront.\n\nNow, a few weeks later, Sarah and I are still on speaking terms, but there's an awkward tension. She hasn't offered to pay me back, and I've been hesitant to push the issue further. My friends are split in their opinions, and it’s causing some strain on our group dynamics. \n\nAm I the asshole for expecting Sarah to pay me back for the concert ticket I let her use?""}]","{

89,AITA for telling my roommate she can't host so many movie nights in our room?,"Hello, I need advice on if I'm actually in the wrong or not. I (18F) live with my roommate we'll call her Alice (18F), in college. Alice is aro-ace, this will be important. She has a projector and likes to host movie nights in our room when I'm not there.   Recently I had two shitty nights and every time I've come back there's been 5+ people in my room past 11 pm. Yesterday after they cleared out I asked my roommate to not host so many especially when she is aware I'll be coming back. She said okay and went to join her friends in the hall.  My boyfriend(18M)stayed in my room late that night to comfort me. When my roommate came back she saw us and said ""I don't understand how you asked me to not host so many movie nights when you didn't even ask me if he could stay the night"" to which me and him said he wasn't and we were waiting for her to get back so he could leave.  After he left she said she wanted to talk. She told me, whenever me and him cuddle, dance while we talk (a weird thing we do), or just show PDA to each other it makes her uncomfortable. She said she's not sure if it's due to her being aro-ace. Also saying that she doesn't want him over as often, he's normally over 5-6 times a week. While she either has her friends in our room for similar amounts of time (alittle less) or stands with our door open talking to them, whenever I'm trying to sleep. Also claiming that because they aren't friends it feels like he's a stranger in her room. And that she hoped they would become friends yet she said every time he's here, he's here for me. Which I thought was normal and that they shouldn't be like friends but more acquaintances.  I felt like she kinda attacked me after I brought up movie nights. Like she wanted to get back at me. Though she said she's felt like this previously. I had asked in the past if he made her uncomfortable and she said no. So I'm confused about how to fix her issue or if I should just keep living the way I have been? Or if I'm even in the wrong here. So AITA?  Edit: My bf doesn't spend the night, and 5-6 is a highball. Like last week he was over 4 times. I just gave a higher number cause I wanted opinions but he normally isnt over that many times a week.",NAH,"Judgement: NAH, Post: Hello, I need advice on if I'm actually in the wrong or not.

She said she\'s not sure if it\'s due to her being aro-ace. Also saying that she doesn\'t want him over as often, he\'s normally over 5-6 times a week. While she either has her friends in our room for similar amounts of time (alittle less) or stands with our door open talking to them, whenever I\'m trying to sleep. Also claiming that because they aren\'t friends it feels like he\'s a stranger in her room. And that she hoped they would become friends yet she said every time he\'s here, he\'s here for me. Which I thought was normal and that they shouldn\'t be like friends but more acquaintances.  I felt like she kinda attacked me after I brought up movie nights. Like she wanted to get back at me. Though she said she\'s felt like this previously. I had asked in the past if he made her uncomfortable and she said no. So I\'m confused about how to fix her issue or if I should just keep living the way I have been? Or if I\'m even in the wrong here. So AITA?  Edit: My bf doesn\'t spend the night, and 5-6 is a highball. Like last week he was over 4 times. I just gave a higher number cause I wanted opinions but he normally isnt over that many times a week.'}]","OP's roommate, Alice, has been hosting movie nights in their shared room, which OP had asked her to limit due to personal reasons. However, when OP's boyfriend stayed over to comfort her, Alice became uncomfortable with their PDA and his frequent visits, citing her aro-ace identity as the reason. Despite previously not expressing any issues with OP's boyfriend, Alice's concerns seem to be a reaction to OP's request to limit movie nights, making OP wonder if they're in the wrong for not being more considerate of Alice's feelings.","'AITA for Limiting Movie Nights, Then Being Told My Boyfriend Is Problematic?'","Judgement: NAH, Title: 'AITA for Limiting Movie Nights, Then Being Told My Boyfriend Is Problematic?'","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

They decided to give the child up for adoption. A girl. Later on, we meet, get married, and I have three kids that are now 15, 14, and 9. In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship. My children were also very young when my husband died with my youngest two having pretty much no memories of him and my oldest very few and we have spent many years moving on with our lives (yes I know that sounds horrible). My SIL is not going to give our contact information to the girl without my consent of course, but I do feel bad. My SIL also told me that she had found her biological mother but that she didn’t want anything to do with her so I feel doubly bad. AITA for not bringing my husbands biological daughter into our lives?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Judgement: NAH, Title: 'AITA for Limiting Movie Nights, Then Being Told My Boyfriend Is Problematic?'""}]","For a bit of context, I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for about a year. We both love watching movies and decided to have regular movie nights to unwind and spend time together. However, early on, I noticed my boyfriend had a strong preference for certain types of films that I found quite problematic. I’m talking about movies that promote toxic masculinity, contain excessive violence, and have pretty misogynistic undertones. 

At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it became pretty clear to me that he had a pattern. I enjoy a wide range of films—indies, documentaries, comedies—but I found myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable during our movie nights. I gently brought it up to him, expressing how I felt about the themes and messages in some of the films he chose. I suggested that we could set a limit on how many of those types of movies we watch each month. 

He seemed to take it well, but a few weeks later, he casually mentioned it to a mutual friend. I overheard them chatting about “how controlling” I was being for wanting to limit our movie nights. The way he framed it made it sound like I was trying to dictate the entertainment, not expressing genuine concern about the messages these films send.

I understand movie preferences can be subjective, and he has every right to enjoy what he likes, but I also have the right to stand up against what I find troubling. Our friend told him that they thought he might be problematic for dismissing my feelings and characterizing it as controlling. I felt torn; I didn’t want to come across as the villain here, but I didn’t want to compromise my values to keep the peace during our movie nights. 

After some time, we had a heart-to-heart where I expressed my feelings about the situation. He admitted that he hadn't realized how much it affected me, and we agreed to be more mindful of each other’s preferences in the future. 

So, with everything that happened, am I the asshole for wanting to limit our movie nights and voicing my concerns about the kinds of films we watch? ","So I (30F) have been dating my boyfriend (32M) for about a year now. We live separately but spend weekends together, which sometimes includes movie nights. It used to be a fun thing we did together, but recently it’s been becoming an issue.

My boyfriend loves movies. Like, really loves them. He watches at least one movie every day and has an extensive collection of DVDs and streaming subscriptions. I enjoy movies too, but not to the same extent. I usually prefer to wind down with a book or some TV, and I don’t have the patience to sit through a 3-hour epic all the time.

Lately, he’s been insisting that we have movie marathons on weekends, choosing obscure films or really long ones. It feels overwhelming to me. I’ve suggested that we mix it up and do other activities, but he always comes back to wanting to watch movies. When I finally said I wanted to limit our movie nights to maybe one night a weekend, he got really upset and said I was stifling his passion.

I talked about this with some friends, and surprisingly, they took his side. They said it’s great to have someone so passionate about something and that I should be more supportive. One friend even went as far as to say it was problematic of me to try and change something he loves this much.

Now I’m feeling torn. I was trying to set a boundary for my own comfort, but I didn’t mean to hurt him or make him feel less appreciated. I know he isn’t trying to be inconsiderate, he just genuinely loves movies that much.

We’ve had a few discussions since then, and he seems to understand my need for variety, but it’s still a bit of a sore spot. He suggested we could take turns picking the activity, which seems like a fair compromise. I think we’re both trying to navigate this without stepping on each other’s toes, but it’s been a bit challenging.

Am I the asshole for wanting to limit our movie nights, even though it’s something he’s so passionate about?","So my boyfriend and I have been together for about 3 years now and things have been great. He's always been really enthusiastic about movies and would often suggest we go see new releases or have movie nights at home. However, about a year ago, I started noticing that our movie nights were consistently going late, often past midnight. Not just the movie itself, but also the discussion afterwards, and then sometimes even playing video games or browsing online. I have work the next day, and I need to get a good night's sleep. I started to set some boundaries, like setting a specific end time for our movie nights, or suggesting we watch a shorter film if we were running low on time. At first, he was understanding, but as time went on, he started to get a bit resentful when I would insist on us wrapping things up. I explained to him that I needed to get a good night's sleep, and that it was impacting my work and overall well-being. He would sometimes say that I was being too strict or controlling, but I felt like I was being reasonable.

Fast forward to last week, when we were out at a movie theater, and he got really agitated when I suggested we leave at a certain time. He started saying that I was being unfair and that I was always trying to control him. Another couple nearby overheard the argument and the woman approached us, saying that she thought my boyfriend's behavior was really problematic. She told me that she had been in a similar situation with her ex-boyfriend, who would also get really upset when she tried to set boundaries. She said that it sounded like my boyfriend was struggling with respect for my needs and boundaries. I have to admit, hearing her say that made me realize that maybe I wasn't being too strict or controlling after all. Maybe I was just trying to take care of myself.

Now, I feel like I'm being told that I'm the one who's being unreasonable for setting boundaries in the first place.

We were all excited, and I was looking forward to catching up with everyone. However, things took a turn that I didn’t see coming. 

While we were walking around, I found a pair of shoes that I really liked but they were a little out of my budget. I hesitated and took a few minutes to decide whether I should buy them or not. My friends, who had already been browsing for a while and were starting to get restless, kept asking me if I was ready to move on. I felt overwhelmed and pressured, and eventually told them to just go ahead without me since I didn’t want to rush my choice.

They agreed but promised to come back and check on me in 20 minutes. However, when I finally made my decision, I couldn’t find them anywhere. I waited for almost an hour, and every time I checked back near the store we had last been at, they weren’t there. I started to panic a bit and tried calling my friend’s phone, but she wouldn’t answer. After a while, I decided to wander around the mall searching for them but had no luck. 

A few hours later, I finally spotted them outside of a café, eating and laughing. I felt hurt and abandoned. When I approached them, they seemed surprised to see me and admitted they forgot about me. They said they were just ready to move on and didn’t think I’d take that long to decide.

Afterward, I vented a bit on social media, expressing how upset I felt about being left behind. Some of my other friends chimed in, supporting me, but I also heard from a few that I was overreacting and that it was my fault for taking too long. 

Looking back, I can see that I should have communicated better with my friends about how long I might take and perhaps I shouldn’t have let them leave without me. But at the same time, I felt they could have been more considerate. Now, there’s some tension in our group, and I’m feeling a bit isolated.

So, AITA for being upset about my friends leaving me behind at the mall?","I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some outside perspective. So last weekend, I went to the mall with a group of my friends—let’s call them Sarah, Mike, and Jess. We had planned to spend the day shopping, grabbing lunch, and just hanging out. It was supposed to be a fun day, but it turned into a mess.

We split up at the mall because Sarah wanted to check out a store that the rest of us weren't interested in. We agreed to meet up in an hour, so Mike, Jess, and I went our separate way. An hour later, I showed up at the meeting point on time, but Sarah was nowhere to be seen. Mike and Jess showed up a few minutes later, and we waited for another ten minutes. I suggested we call her, but Mike said she was always late and that we should just go ahead without her. Jess agreed, and reluctantly, I did too.

After another half hour of shopping, we ran into Sarah, who was clearly upset. She asked why we hadn't waited for her and why we didn’t answer her texts. Checking my phone, I realized I had missed a few messages and calls from her because it was on silent. She was furious and stormed off, saying she felt abandoned.

Mike then suggested we let her cool off, but I felt terrible and wanted to apologize. Jess told me Sarah was being overly dramatic and that she’d get over it. We eventually found her near the food court looking really upset. I tried to apologize, but she was having none of it and called us terrible friends for leaving her behind.

The day ended on a sour note, and we all went home. Ever since, Sarah has been giving me the cold shoulder. Mike and Jess think she’s overreacting and that it wasn’t a big deal, but I feel awful and think maybe I should’ve insisted we wait or at least keep trying to reach her.

Friends I've talked to are split—some say Sarah has a right to be upset, while others think she’s making a mountain out of a molehill. I feel like everyone, including myself, kind of messed up in one way or another.

So, AITA for being left behind by my friends at the mall? Or does everyone share a bit of the blame here?","I've been friends with Rachel, Mike, and Emily since high school. We've always been a close-knit group, but over the years, I've noticed that they've been slowly drifting apart. We used to hang out at least once a week, but lately, it's been every few months. 

Last weekend, we decided to meet up at the mall to celebrate my birthday. We all agreed to meet at the food court at 2 PM. I got there early and waited for about 20 minutes before texting Rachel, Mike, and Emily to see if they were running late. Rachel replied saying she was stuck in traffic and would be there in 30 minutes, Mike said he was running errands and would meet us soon, and Emily said she was still getting ready and would be there in an hour.

I waited for another hour, and then I started to get a little anxious. I texted Rachel again, and she said she was still stuck in traffic. I decided to give Mike a call, and he told me that he was actually at a friend's house and had forgotten about our plans. I was shocked and asked him why he didn't text me or let me know. He said he was sorry and would meet us soon.

I waited for another hour, and then I decided to text Emily again. She said she was still getting ready and would be there in 30 minutes. I was getting frustrated at this point, so I decided to go look for them. I searched the entire mall, but I couldn't find any of them. I finally found them at a game store, playing video games and laughing together. They told me that they had decided to go to the game store instead of waiting for me at the food court, and that they would catch up with me later.

I was hurt and felt like I was being left behind. I told them that I was tired of being stood up and that I needed some space. They apologized and said they would make it up to me, but I'm not sure if I can forgive them. They seem to think that I'm being dramatic and that I should just forget about it.

I'm packing my bags and preparing to move out because I don't feel like I'm a priority to them. They're acting like I'm the AH for being upset and left behind.

91,AITA for revealing my SIL secret to my parents?,"Context: We are an Irani Family living in Germany, I (26f) moved back to my parents house to support my father(65) with his health and my brother (31m) proposed to his GF(29f) of 5 months in January. It was a shock for everyone but we all supported him.  Their wedding is at the end of November and everyone is doing their best to help.   &#x200B;  My brother invited Vi and her family. Vi just turned 20 while her parents are the same age as my parents. When her parents came to Germany my family helped them a lot and in return Vi’s parents babysat me and my brother a lot. Her parents are our second parents, my bro even calls Vi’s dad regularly and they talk.   &#x200B;  Now this is important, Vi and her family are doing a lot for the wedding. Her parents help with decorations and ceremony planning and Vi designed the invitation card AND drew small chibi sketches of EVERY PERSON ATTENDING! All for fucking free. Yeah. Free.   All they ask for return is a nice seat at the wedding and their gas prices to be paid. They drive 2 hours to get here and 2 hours to go back EVERY SUNDAY SINCE JANUARY! Both my brother and SIL did try to give them money for their work but they decline it, my brother cried happiness when he saw the decoration and so did SIL.  &#x200B;  I never really had time to bond with SIL alone and last Monday I did, we went for some coffee. The first 30 minutes it was nice and we had fun. Vi called me to chat but I told her I was busy and will call back later. When I hung up, I realized how weird SIL looked and I asked what was wrong. She told me the last month she grew „disgusted“ with Vi and her parents. I asked why and she said the age gap is huge between them and that they ask for a lot when they come over. Angry was an understatement. Her mother had 6 miscarriages until Vi came, and they only ask for the gas price and breakfast. Persian breakfast is literally just bread, cucumber and cheese. I was furious and called her out on this and she cried begging me to keep this secret between „two sisters“.  &#x200B;  I was too angry, I stormed off and told Mom. On my way I also called Vi and her mother picked up and I told her everything. Her mother thanked me and hung up.   My parents are furious at Vi and refuse to help or attend the wedding UNTIL SIL apologizes to Vi and her parents. Vi called me and she was mad, saying that SIL was already being a „bridezilla“ in private and now she also made her mom cry. I saw some screenshots and apparently Vi had drawn over 300 sketches until SIL was ""okay"" with them. Though SIL blames it on her OCD (idk if she has it or not)  &#x200B;  My brother is keeping himself distant because he agrees SIL messed up but „he has to respect his wife“ bs. SIL and her family have been blowing up my phone about how I am a snitch and a jealous „bitch“.

My sister-in-law has often voiced her frustrations about how they treat her, claiming they dismiss her opinions and make her feel unwelcome during family gatherings. Initially, I tried to stay out of it, thinking it was their problem to resolve.

However, it became a bit much when I overheard her venting to my brother about how his family behaved during a recent holiday dinner. They criticized her cooking, questioned her career choices, and even made a few snide remarks about her background. I felt terrible for her and thought my brother just wasn't seeing the whole picture.

In a moment of frustration, I ended up telling my mom about my sister-in-law's complaints. I thought she should know how her future daughter-in-law felt, and maybe it would encourage some change in how they treated her. I made it clear that I was only trying to help their relationship, but my sister-in-law found out and was furious with me. She confronted me, saying it was a breach of trust and that I shouldn't have involved my mom. 

Now, my mother has been trying to mediate, but my brother is caught in the middle, feeling like he needs to defend his fiancée while also keeping the peace with our family. Both my sister-in-law and my brother are upset with me, and I know my intentions were good, but I can’t shake the feeling that I might have messed things up.

I feel like I was trying to help, but now it seems I've created a bigger problem. Was I wrong for telling my mom about my sister-in-law’s complaints, or did I just want to look out for her? AITA for getting involved?","My sister-in-law, Katie, has always been outspoken, which I usually appreciate. She’s been with my brother, James, for about two years, and they recently got engaged. Now, our family is very close-knit and we have regular gatherings that Katie is often a part of.

Katie has a habit of venting to me about various things, which I was fine with until she started complaining about James' side of the family – particularly our mom. She would say things like how our mom is too nosy, overly affectionate, and sometimes even passive-aggressive. Katie often said she felt smothered and disrespected at family events. As much as I love my family, I could understand some of her points, but it became a bit much when I was continuously put in the middle.

One evening, Katie and I were having a private conversation, and she went on another rant about my mom. This time, it felt especially harsh. I tried talking to her about working through her concerns directly with my mom or maybe even James, but she brushed it off and kept unloading on me.

Eventually, the guilt of keeping this from my family got to me. I felt like I was betraying them by not saying anything, and Katie's constant complaints were starting to cloud my feelings about our family gatherings. So, I decided to tell my mom about Katie’s grievances. I thought maybe if she knew, she could adjust her behavior a bit to make Katie feel more comfortable. 

Predictably, it didn’t go well. My mom was hurt and defensive, which led to a huge argument during our next family get-together. Katie was furious with me for breaking her trust, and James was stuck in the middle, trying to mediate between all sides. Now, family gatherings are incredibly tense, and Katie has distanced herself from me. James is upset because he feels like I've stirred the pot unnecessarily.

Everyone feels betrayed or attacked, and I’m left wondering if I did the right thing by spilling the beans. I just wanted to help, but I’ve clearly made things worse.

AITA for telling my mom about my sister-in-law's complaints about her fiancé's family?","So my sister and I have been close since we were kids, and we're both very open with each other about everything. I'm engaged to her older brother, and we're getting married in a few months. My sister is also very close to her fiancé, who's actually a bit of a controlling and emotionally abusive person, but she's in denial about it.

Recently, my sister's fiancé's family has been getting on my nerves. They're super clingy and always dropping by unannounced, and they're also very critical of me. They make snide comments about my job, my fashion sense, and even my cooking. I've tried to brush it off, but it's been really frustrating.

A few days ago, my sister came over and started venting to me about how her fiancé's family is being so intrusive and annoying. She said they're always calling her and texting her, asking for updates on her wedding plans and wanting to know when they can meet me. She was really upset about it, and I could see why.

As we were talking, my sister mentioned that she had been having some issues with her fiancé's family being super critical of her too, and how they always make her feel bad about herself. I felt a surge of anger and frustration on her behalf, and I blurted out that I think his family is just using her for their own purposes - they're using her to get to me, and to be part of the family.

My sister was taken aback by my words, and she got defensive. She said that I'm being too harsh and that I don't understand the situation. She said that his family is just being loving and supportive, and that I'm being paranoid. I realized that she's still in denial about the situation, and that she's being manipulated by her fiancé's family.

I told her that I think she deserves better than to be treated this way, and that she should set some boundaries with his family. She got upset and told me that I'm being judgmental and critical, and that I'm not supporting her. I realized that I may have been too blunt, and that I should have been more sensitive to her feelings.

The next day, I got a call from my mom, who's also close to my sister. My sister had told her about our conversation, and my mom was upset with me for being so harsh with my sister. She said that I should have been more supportive and understanding, and that I should have let my sister handle the situation her own way. I felt like I was being attacked from both sides, and I didn't know what to do.

Now my sister is upset with me, and my mom is upset with me. I feel like I've alienated both of them, and I'm not sure how to fix the situation.

She’s been with my brother, James, for about two years, and they recently got engaged. Now, our family is very close-knit and we have regular gatherings that Katie is often a part of.\n\nKatie has a habit of venting to me about various things, which I was fine with until she started complaining about James' side of the family – particularly our mom. She would say things like how our mom is too nosy, overly affectionate, and sometimes even passive-aggressive. Katie often said she felt smothered and disrespected at family events. As much as I love my family, I could understand some of her points, but it became a bit much when I was continuously put in the middle.\n\nOne evening, Katie and I were having a private conversation, and she went on another rant about my mom. This time, it felt especially harsh. I tried talking to her about working through her concerns directly with my mom or maybe even James, but she brushed it off and kept unloading on me.\n\nEventually, the guilt of keeping this from my family got to me. I felt like I was betraying them by not saying anything, and Katie's constant complaints were starting to cloud my feelings about our family gatherings. So, I decided to tell my mom about Katie’s grievances. I thought maybe if she knew, she could adjust her behavior a bit to make Katie feel more comfortable. \n\nPredictably, it didn’t go well. My mom was hurt and defensive, which led to a huge argument during our next family get-together. Katie was furious with me for breaking her trust, and James was stuck in the middle, trying to mediate between all sides. Now, family gatherings are incredibly tense, and Katie has distanced herself from me. James is upset because he feels like I've stirred the pot unnecessarily.\n\nEveryone feels betrayed or attacked, and I’m left wondering if I did the right thing by spilling the beans. I just wanted to help, but I’ve clearly made things worse.\n\nAITA for telling my mom about my sister-in-law's complaints about her fiancé's family?""}]","{

92,AITA for forcing my MIL to babysit?,"Throwaway.    Ever since me (27F) and my husband Mark (30F) had our kids, my MIL had been begging to have them over every day. We live two hours away from her house, but we make sure to visit her on weekends as the kids love spending time at her place and playing with their cousins who live nearby too.   However whenever they’re at her house she never does anything for them. She doesn’t make them food, doesn’t look after them, and is generally just happy holding them or playing with them for a bit. Of course this is okay with us, and we are more than happy fixing them a quick snack or making sure they’re well. But lately she’s been calling me and Mark nonstop begging us to drop the kids at her place overnight. She says she misses spending ‘real’ quality time with them, and keeps saying I refuse to let her see them more than once a week. We tried to explain that with us being two hours away and the kids being a handful (they’re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her. She still insisted but we ended up saying no. She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn’t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only.   Into the issue. After saying goodbye to the kids Mark took me to a fancy restaurant halfway across town. He said that since the kids will be at their grandma’s place we can finally have quality time. I agreed and half an hour into our evening we got a call from MIL. I was afraid at first but she said nothing happened, she just asked when will we back. I replied that we will pick up the kids at 9 am the next day, and she immediately got upset. She said she couldn’t handle the kids and they kept demanding food, that she play with them, or straight up saying they want their cousins over. We tried telling her we are busy and at best will come over in a few hours, but she refused. She said she, and those are her exact words, “had her fill with the children and never expected such trouble”. I told her that was normal behaviour for kids their age and she started yelling at me on the phone. Mark ended up taking the phone and told her we will be over at 9 the next morning. Then he ended the call and we ended up going back to our date.   Next morning we showed up at 9 exactly. Our kids were happy to see us but my MIL refused to speak to either of us. When Mark tried joking with her she screamed at him that we trapped her with our kids and that we were irresponsible and cruel. I reminded her she was the one who kept insisting we do this and she said she changed her mind and we could’ve taken the kids with us and gone home. She’s now telling family that we dropped the kids off at her house and refused to come pick them up and that I was super rude. I’ve gotten several messages saying I should be a better DIL. AITA?

Ever since me (27F) and my husband Mark (30F) had our kids, my MIL had been begging to have them over every day. We live two hours away from her house, but we make sure to visit her on weekends as the kids love spending time at her place and playing with their cousins who live nearby too.   However whenever they’re at her house she never does anything for them. She doesn’t make them food, doesn’t look after them, and is generally just happy holding them or playing with them for a bit. Of course this is okay with us, and we are more than happy fixing them a quick snack or making sure they’re well. But lately she’s been calling me and Mark nonstop begging us to drop the kids at her place overnight. She says she misses spending ‘real’ quality time with them, and keeps saying I refuse to let her see them more than once a week. We tried to explain that with us being two hours away and the kids being a handful (they’re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her. She still insisted but we ended up saying no. She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn’t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only.   Into the issue. After saying goodbye to the kids Mark took me to a fancy restaurant halfway across town. He said that since the kids will be at their grandma’s place we can finally have quality time. I agreed and half an hour into our evening we got a call from MIL. I was afraid at first but she said nothing happened, she just asked when will we back. I replied that we will pick up the kids at 9 am the next day, and she immediately got upset. She said she couldn’t handle the kids and they kept demanding food, that she play with them, or straight up saying they want their cousins over. We tried telling her we are busy and at best will come over in a few hours, but she refused. She said she, and those are her exact words, “had her fill with the children and never expected such trouble”. I told her that was normal behaviour for kids their age and she started yelling at me on the phone. Mark ended up taking the phone and told her we will be over at 9 the next morning. Then he ended the call and we ended up going back to our date.   Next morning we showed up at 9 exactly. Our kids were happy to see us but my MIL refused to speak to either of us. When Mark tried joking with her she screamed at him that we trapped her with our kids and that we were irresponsible and cruel. I reminded her she was the one who kept insisting we do this and she said she changed her mind and we could’ve taken the kids with us and gone home. She’s now telling family that we dropped the kids off at her house and refused to come pick them up and that I was super rude. I’ve gotten several messages saying I should be a better DIL. AITA?

My husband (31M) and I have been together for several years, and while we generally get along well, there’s been a persistent issue with his mother (MIL, 60s) when it comes to caring for our kids.

When our first child was born, we were excited to have my husband’s family involved. Initially, my MIL seemed eager to help out, but things started to go downhill quickly. She would frequently show up late for babysitting, forget to feed the kids meals or provide them with snacks, and would often let them watch hours of TV without supervision. My husband and I expressed our concerns, and although she apologized and promised to be better, the same issues kept occurring.

Fast forward to now, and things haven’t improved. The last straw was when I discovered that she left our 4-year-old unattended while she took a phone call outside. Luckily, our child was safe, but it scared me to think of what could have happened. I confronted my MIL about it, and she dismissed my worries as “overreacting” and said I was being a “controlling” mother. This really hurt because I’m just trying to ensure my kids are safe and well taken care of.

Recently, my husband and I were invited to a wedding and needed someone to watch the kids for the evening. I suggested hiring a trusted babysitter instead, but my husband wanted to ask his mom again. I refused and said I didn’t trust her with our kids anymore, which led to a huge argument. My husband feels like I’m being unfair and that she deserves another chance to prove herself, while I feel that my children’s safety comes first.

His mom is now upset with me, and I feel bad for causing tension in the family, but at the same time, I can’t shake the feeling that my instincts are right. My husband’s sister has also weighed in, saying I’m too quick to judge their mom and should lighten up. Meanwhile, my parents have backed me up, agreeing that I have every right to be protective.

I never wanted to be the bad guy, but I also don’t want to compromise on my children's safety. So, AITA for not trusting my MIL to care for my kids after she continuously fails?","I (32F) have always had a strained relationship with my mother-in-law (MIL, 60F). From the start, she has been overly critical of my parenting style, constantly comparing my methods to hers. My husband (34M) tries to play peacemaker, but it often feels like he's stuck in the middle, which adds to the tension.

We have two kids, 5F and 3M, and as any parent knows, their safety and well-being are paramount. My MIL has offered to babysit on numerous occasions, but each time, something goes wrong. The first time, she fed our daughter food we specifically asked her to avoid due to allergies. Luckily, the reaction was mild, but it was a scare nonetheless.

Another time, she took both kids to a park without their car seats. She claimed that her generation didn't use them and that it was ""overprotective nonsense,"" but it's the law and for their safety. There was also an incident where she left them unattended in the bathtub, which I find absolutely unacceptable. When I brought it up, she brushed it off, saying she raised her kids just fine and that I worry too much.

After these experiences, I’ve been declining her offers to babysit, instead opting for our trusted nanny or my own parents. My MIL has noticed and confronted me about it, stating that I don’t trust her and that I'm being overly dramatic. I was honest and told her that her previous lapses in judgment make me uncomfortable relying on her for childcare.

She was furious and accused me of trying to alienate her from her grandchildren. She even went as far as to say that I'm trying to paint her as a bad grandmother, which is not my intention. My husband tried to mediate, suggesting we give her one more chance with clear guidelines, but I'm not confident she'd follow them. 

Some friends and family think I'm right to be cautious, especially with the kids' safety at stake. Others think I’m being too harsh and feel that everyone deserves a second (or third) chance, especially family. 

Now, my MIL is giving me the cold shoulder, and the tension is palpable during family gatherings. My husband is caught in the middle and it's causing some strain between us as well. 

Was I wrong for reaching my breaking point and refusing my MIL's help? Am I the asshole for not trusting her to care for my kids after she continuously fails?","My mother-in-law (MIL) has always been a bit of a helicopter parent. She lives close to us and loves to babysit for us when we need a night out or a break. However, every time she watches the kids, something goes wrong. Either she forgets to feed them, or she lets them watch too much TV, or she tries to discipline them in a way that I don’t agree with.

The latest incident happened last week when I asked her to watch the kids for a few hours so we could attend a family gathering. When we got back, my MIL was visibly frazzled and said that one of the kids had gotten upset because she wouldn’t let them have a popsicle. She claimed she had offered them a healthy snack, but my kid was adamant that they wanted a popsicle.

I was already skeptical about leaving the kids with her, but what really made me lose trust was when she told me that she had taken the kids to the park without asking me first. I had explicitly told her that the kids weren’t allowed to play at the park without me because there was a lot of traffic and I was worried about them getting hurt.

When I confronted my MIL about it, she became defensive and said that I was being overprotective and that she could take care of the kids just fine. She also implied that I was not trusting her as a grandmother and that I should just let her take care of the kids more often.

My husband is now caught in the middle, trying to mediate between us. He thinks I’m being too hard on his mom and that she’s just trying to be helpful. But honestly, I don’t think I can trust her to care for my kids anymore.

I don’t know what to do. Part of me feels guilty for not trusting her more, but another part of me feels like I have every right to be worried about the kids’ safety and well-being.

To give you a little background, we’ve been friends since middle school, and while we've always had our ups and downs, this particular incident has stuck with me.

Back in high school, there was a situation where I had been working really hard on a project for a class. I put in countless hours, and when it came time to present, Jess was supposed to be my partner. Just a night before the presentation, she backed out on me, saying she didn’t have time because she was ""too busy"" with other things. I was upset but managed to pull it off alone. I got a good grade, but it was bittersweet because I felt like I didn’t really get to share the credit with her.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we were reminiscing about school days, and Jess brought up the subject of teamwork. I couldn’t help but bring up the incident. I expressed that her backing out really hurt me at the time and that I had to carry the load alone. Jess got defensive and argued that I was just holding onto the past and that she was a different person now. 

I didn’t mean to bring up old wounds, but I felt like it was important to address how her actions impacted me. Instead of a mature discussion, we ended up in a screaming match, and it got pretty ugly. Now, Jess hasn’t spoken to me since, and I’ve been reflecting on whether it was justified for me to bring it up after so long.

Some of our mutual friends think I was wrong to bring it up at all, claiming I’m just being petty. Others support me, saying that we shouldn't have unresolved feelings about the past. I genuinely believed it was time to have an honest conversation, but I’m starting to wonder if I should have let it go instead. 

So, AITA for getting into an argument with Jess over something that happened years ago?","Back in high school, my friend Jake and I were part of a tight-knit group of friends. We had our ups and downs like any group, but we generally got along well. There was this one incident, though, that always bothered me. Our mutual friend, Sarah, had a massive crush on Jake. She confessed her feelings to him at a party, and he completely brushed her off in a pretty humiliating way, making jokes about it in front of everyone. Sarah was devastated and ended up leaving the party early. It stuck with me because I thought Jake could have handled it better, even if he didn't feel the same way about her.

Fast forward to now, we're all adults, and our lives have moved on. Jake and I were hanging out last weekend, and somehow, the conversation drifted to high school memories. I brought up the incident with Sarah and told him how I thought he was a jerk back then for the way he treated her. Jake was taken aback and got defensive, saying it was years ago and that he’s changed since then. He also said it wasn’t fair to judge him by his teenage actions and that everyone made mistakes when they were younger. Things escalated quickly, and we ended up having a heated argument.

I said some things I probably shouldn't have, accusing him of still being inconsiderate and self-centered. Jake stormed out, and now he's not responding to my texts or calls. Our other friends have mixed opinions. Some think I was right to call him out, while others say I was out of line to bring up something from so long ago, especially when it's clear Jake has moved past it.

Sarah, who I'm still in touch with, said she appreciated me standing up for her but also mentioned that she's long since forgiven Jake and moved on with her life. She thinks it's not worth jeopardizing my friendship with Jake over something that happened years ago.

Now, I'm stuck wondering if I was the asshole for dragging up old memories and causing a rift with Jake over an incident that everyone else seems to have left in the past. Am I the asshole here?","I've been friends with my friend Sarah since high school. We've been through a lot together, including a particularly tumultuous time in our senior year when we were both struggling with college applications and relationships. There was this one incident where we got into a huge fight because I had to leave a party early to study for a test, and I didn't invite her. She got drunk and ended up making a scene in front of our classmates, and I was really embarrassed.

Fast forward to last weekend, we were hanging out at a bar and started reminiscing about old times. She brought up the party incident and said that I was a terrible friend for abandoning her like that. I explained to her that I had to study for a test and it wasn't a personal slight, but she wouldn't let it go. She kept saying that I was selfish and only cared about myself.

I got defensive and told her that she was being unfair, that I had done so much for her over the years, and that she was just dwelling on one bad moment. She shot back that I was just making excuses and that I had ruined her night. The argument escalated, and we ended up leaving the bar separately.

The next day, I sent her a text apologizing for my part in the argument, but also making it clear that I didn't think I was in the wrong. She responded by saying that I was still being insensitive and that I needed to take responsibility for my actions. I told her that I was trying to apologize and move on, but she said that she needed time and space.

Now we're not speaking, and I'm feeling pretty hurt. I think I was justified in standing up for myself, but I also understand why she's upset. Was I the asshole for getting into an argument over something that happened so long ago, or was she being overly sensitive?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Back in high school, my friend Jake and I were part of a tight-knit group of friends.

94,AITA For not wanting my cat to be called ‘SuperDog’?,"A lighthearted and really low stakes post, but we said we’d throw it out to Reddit to decide:  My partner (35M) and I (33F) have been picked as the adopters of two cats pending final checks (YAY!) but we are having a disagreement about names as he wants to make one of them ‘SuperDog’ (we have agreed on the other name).  His opinion: it’s objectively hilarious (he literally laughs every time he thinks about it, and to be fair, it is funny and it comes from an in-joke of ours).  My opinion: I’m not going outside and shouting ‘SUPERDOG!!’ when it’s time for their food, I don’t want that shouting at the vets, and if god forbid she go missing I don’t want to put that on posters!!!   Does anyone have a pet with a ’weird’ name? How do you feel about it? Should I just give in and let him call her SuperDog? Do I give her another name and just let him call her that?   Just for reference my preferred name is ‘French Fry’ which I know is also not ‘normal’ but it comes from an episode of Malcolm In The Middle where Dewey is naming tigers.

We brought our new furry friend home and immediately started brainstorming names. I’ve always been a little traditional when it comes to pet names, and I lean towards names that reflect their personality or appearance. My partner, on the other hand, has a quirky sense of humor and tends to think outside the box.

After we tossed around some names, my partner suggested naming our cat ""SuperDog"" as a playful twist, considering the cat is kind of big and fluffy. I’ll admit, his intention was all in good fun, but I just couldn’t get behind it. I found the name embarrassing and thought it would be a bit ridiculous to call our cat that. I even imagined how it would sound in public, like at the vet’s office, and it just didn’t sit right with me.

I expressed my feelings to my partner, and he laughed it off, saying it was just a joke and that we could ultimately name the cat whatever we wanted. He thought it would be fun to tell people about the name, but for me, I felt it was too much of a stretch. We went back and forth a bit, with him teasing me, but I stood my ground because I thought it didn’t capture the essence of our new pet.

We finally decided to take a break from naming and just enjoy getting to know our cat first. Both of us have friends who are supportive of either side of the naming debate. Some think ""SuperDog"" is hilarious, while others agree with me that it’s a bit silly. 

In the end, we’re still in the process of figuring out a name that fits our new family member. My partner didn’t get mad or anything, and we ended up bonding over some cute moments with the cat. However, I’m still wondering if I came off too strong for refusing a name that could potentially make him laugh. So, am I the asshole for refusing to name our adopted cat ""SuperDog"" because I think it’s embarrassing?","My partner (27M) and I (26F) recently adopted a cat from the local animal shelter, and we're both really excited to give her a loving home. She’s a sweet little calico with the most adorable face, and we instantly fell in love with her. This is the first pet we've adopted together, so it's a pretty big deal for both of us.

Here's where the issue comes in: my partner has a quirky sense of humor, and he's always coming up with goofy names for things. He suggested we name our new cat ""SuperDog."" I thought he was joking at first, but it turns out he's dead serious. He thinks it's hilarious and believes that the name adds a unique charm to our pet. He even laughed about how funny it would be to call out ""SuperDog"" at the vet or when introducing her to friends.

I, on the other hand, think the name is a bit too much. I get his point about it being humorous, but I feel like it's more embarrassing than anything else. I wanted a sweet and simple name like ""Luna"" or ""Bella,"" something that fits her gentle personality and makes me smile every time I say it. We had a bit of a disagreement over this, with me arguing that while quirky names are fun, they should still be respectable.

We haven't come to a decision yet, and it's causing a slight rift between us. Some of our friends think ""SuperDog"" is hilarious and support his idea, while others agree with me that the name is a bit over the top. My partner and I are otherwise on great terms, and this is the first time something so seemingly trivial has caused tension between us. 

So far, we’ve just been calling her “kitty” or “sweetheart,” and she seems to respond to anything said in a loving tone. I’m worried that if we don’t resolve this soon, it might create an unnecessary strain. I understand his perspective and don't want to diminish his enthusiasm, but I also want to feel comfortable with our pet's name.

Am I the asshole for refusing to name our adopted cat ""SuperDog"" because I think it's embarrassing?","I (27F) and my partner (29M) adopted a beautiful, adorable cat named Luna. We both fell in love with her and decided to keep the name we were given at the shelter. My partner, however, has been obsessed with the name SuperDog for our cat. He thinks it's hilarious and says it suits her perfectly. I just can't stand it - the name is ridiculous and embarrassing to me.

Every time we talk about naming our cat, my partner brings up SuperDog, and I politely decline. He thinks I'm being unreasonable and that I'm stifling his creativity. He's started calling our cat SuperDog in front of friends and family, even though I've specifically asked him not to. I've tried explaining to him why I don't like the name, but he just doesn't get it.

The thing that really gets to me is that he's started to get upset when I correct him and remind him that her name is Luna. He says I'm being controlling and that I need to lighten up. We've had a few arguments about it, but we've never really come to a resolution.

She’s a sweet little calico with the most adorable face, and we instantly fell in love with her. This is the first pet we\'ve adopted together, so it\'s a pretty big deal for both of us.\n\nHere\'s where the issue comes in: my partner has a quirky sense of humor, and he\'s always coming up with goofy names for things. He suggested we name our new cat ""SuperDog."" I thought he was joking at first, but it turns out he\'s dead serious. He thinks it\'s hilarious and believes that the name adds a unique charm to our pet. He even laughed about how funny it would be to call out ""SuperDog"" at the vet or when introducing her to friends.\n\nI, on the other hand, think the name is a bit too much. I get his point about it being humorous, but I feel like it\'s more embarrassing than anything else. I wanted a sweet and simple name like ""Luna"" or ""Bella,"" something that fits her gentle personality and makes me smile every time I say it. We had a bit of a disagreement over this, with me arguing that while quirky names are fun, they should still be respectable.\n\nWe haven\'t come to a decision yet, and it\'s causing a slight rift between us. Some of our friends think ""SuperDog"" is hilarious and support his idea, while others agree with me that the name is a bit over the top. My partner and I are otherwise on great terms, and this is the first time something so seemingly trivial has caused tension between us. \n\nSo far, we’ve just been calling her “kitty” or “sweetheart,” and she seems to respond to anything said in a loving tone. I’m worried that if we don’t resolve this soon, it might create an unnecessary strain. I understand his perspective and don\'t want to diminish his enthusiasm, but I also want to feel comfortable with our pet\'s name.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to name our adopted cat ""SuperDog"" because I think it\'s embarrassing?'}]","{

95,WIBTA for asking my friend (21f) and her roommate/friends to not smoke weed while I'm (20f) at her apt?,"My friend Carly (21f) and I (20f) have been friends for \~8yrs and we go to different colleges in the same city. She lives abt 30min away and it's not easy to hang out often in person. Bc of this, I had no idea she'd started smoking weed regularly til she mentioned it this summer.  Last night, I was invited over to watch a movie. I agreed. I assumed we would be going out to see it in the theater, but it wasn't until we were almost at her apt that I was told we were watching a movie at her apt instead. And also that her roommate and his friend would be there too. When I got to her apt (which is small and has only one window), I was hit with the strong smell of weed. I didn't mention it bc it's none of my business and people smoke all the time in the city. I also figured she was noseblind to it and felt it would be rude/embarrassing to bring it up since there wasn't much she could do.  During the movie, her roommate and his friend each took a hit from a homemade gravity bong they'd recently made. They didn't go out onto the fire escape and the smell was strong. This was the first time I met them and no one else was bothered, so I didn't feel like I could complain. It'd been abt 2.5hrs and had a pounding headache. Carly excitedly showed me the bong and wanted me to get close to watch, but I said the smell was giving me a headache, hoping she'd get the hint. She nodded but didn't seem to fully get it. She sat inside to hit it on the windowsill, but bc of how the bong was made, a lot of smoke leaked into the apt and I had to go sit down, dizzy and overwhelmed. This was the first time I'd been exposed to the smoke for a long time and found out it made me feel like shit.  The bong was hit 3 more times when I was there and for the rest of the night, I felt awful. I had a headache, stomachache, and even though I showered when I got home, it felt like the smell was stuck in my nose, which was nauseating. This morning was the same, plus my heart was pounding, my brain felt really slow, and I was extra anxious for no reason.  I want to be able to prevent this in the future and keep hanging out with Carly. I'm worried that by asking her not to smoke when I'm there, it'll sound like I'm judging her for smoking at all, since I don't smoke or drink (a personal choice, that makes me the ""token straight-edge"" according to her friends). I don't want to be a burden for her or her friends. Wibta to ask for Carly and her roommate/friends to not smoke while I'm there?  tl;dr - I don't smoke weed and I'm not used to the smell, so I get awful symptoms (head/stomachache, nausea, etc.) when exposed to it for a long time at my friend's apt.

She lives abt 30min away and it\'s not easy to hang out often in person. Bc of this, I had no idea she\'d started smoking weed regularly til she mentioned it this summer.  Last night, I was invited over to watch a movie. I agreed. I assumed we would be going out to see it in the theater, but it wasn\'t until we were almost at her apt that I was told we were watching a movie at her apt instead. And also that her roommate and his friend would be there too. When I got to her apt (which is small and has only one window), I was hit with the strong smell of weed. I didn\'t mention it bc it\'s none of my business and people smoke all the time in the city. I also figured she was noseblind to it and felt it would be rude/embarrassing to bring it up since there wasn\'t much she could do.  During the movie, her roommate and his friend each took a hit from a homemade gravity bong they\'d recently made. They didn\'t go out onto the fire escape and the smell was strong. This was the first time I met them and no one else was bothered, so I didn\'t feel like I could complain. It\'d been abt 2.5hrs and had a pounding headache. Carly excitedly showed me the bong and wanted me to get close to watch, but I said the smell was giving me a headache, hoping she\'d get the hint. She nodded but didn\'t seem to fully get it. She sat inside to hit it on the windowsill, but bc of how the bong was made, a lot of smoke leaked into the apt and I had to go sit down, dizzy and overwhelmed. This was the first time I\'d been exposed to the smoke for a long time and found out it made me feel like shit.  The bong was hit 3 more times when I was there and for the rest of the night, I felt awful. I had a headache, stomachache, and even though I showered when I got home, it felt like the smell was stuck in my nose, which was nauseating. This morning was the same, plus my heart was pounding, my brain felt really slow, and I was extra anxious for no reason.  I want to be able to prevent this in the future and keep hanging out with Carly. I\'m worried that by asking her not to smoke when I\'m there, it\'ll sound like I\'m judging her for smoking at all, since I don\'t smoke or drink (a personal choice, that makes me the ""token straight-edge"" according to her friends). I don\'t want to be a burden for her or her friends. Wibta to ask for Carly and her roommate/friends to not smoke while I\'m there?  tl;dr - I don\'t smoke weed and I\'m not used to the smell, so I get awful symptoms (head/stomachache, nausea, etc.) when exposed to it for a long time at my friend\'s apt.

They decided to give the child up for adoption. A girl. Later on, we meet, get married, and I have three kids that are now 15, 14, and 9. In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that’s not possible since he’s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don’t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship. My children were also very young when my husband died with my youngest two having pretty much no memories of him and my oldest very few and we have spent many years moving on with our lives (yes I know that sounds horrible). My SIL is not going to give our contact information to the girl without my consent of course, but I do feel bad.

We’ve been through a lot together, and we have a great bond. However, Sam has a habit of smoking weed whenever we hang out, and it’s really started to bother me. I’m not against weed in itself—I understand it can be therapeutic and fun, but I personally don't smoke or enjoy being around it.

The issue is that I have some anxiety and a bit of a history with substance abuse in my family, so being around it makes me uncomfortable. I’ve never brought it up with Sam because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings or create any tension between us. I really value our friendship and the last thing I want to do is make him feel judged or unwelcome. 

Every time we hang out, I find myself anxiously waiting for him to pull out his stash, hoping he won’t, but then he always does. I kind of just go along with it and try to distract myself, but it’s definitely affecting how much I enjoy our time together. I’ve also noticed I’ve been avoiding reaching out to him as much because I worry about the weed situation.

Recently, I mentioned this to a mutual friend who seemed surprised I hadn’t said anything to Sam yet. They said I should confront Sam and express how I feel. That really got me thinking. I don’t want to lose a great friend, but I also want to be true to myself and my feelings.

I tried to bring it up casually in a conversation the next time we hung out, but I just froze and couldn’t get the words out. Instead, I ended up acting like everything was fine, and he lit up right in front of me. The situation remains the same, and I just feel stuck.

Now, I feel a bit guilty for not saying anything but at the same time, I don’t want to come off as judgmental or push him away. So, AITA for being too afraid to ask my friend not to smoke weed around me?","I (22F) have a close friend, Sarah (23F), who I've known since high school. Sarah has always been a bit of a free spirit, and recently, she's gotten into smoking weed. I really don't have a problem with people using weed, but personally, it makes me very uncomfortable. I have a bit of a history with substances due to family issues, and the smell alone brings back some pretty bad memories.

Sarah's a great friend and has been there for me through a lot. I really don't want to seem like I'm judging her or risking our friendship over something that is legal here, especially since I know it helps her with anxiety. The problem is, every time we hang out at her place now, there's a strong smell of weed, and sometimes she lights up while I'm there. I haven't said anything because I don't want her to feel bad or think I'm trying to control her life. 

Recently, we were planning a movie night at her apartment, and just as I was about to go over, I found myself making excuses not to go. I realized that I was avoiding her place because of the weed, and it made me feel even worse. I ended up going, but I still couldn't bring myself to say anything when she started smoking.

When I talked to a couple of mutual friends about it, they had mixed reactions. One understood where I was coming from but said I should just be honest with Sarah. The other friend thought I was overreacting and that I needed to just deal with it since it's her place and her choice.

For now, I'm stuck between wanting to be a good friend by supporting her choices and needing to take care of my own mental well-being. I don't want to end up distancing myself from her, but I'm genuinely too afraid to bring it up. It's eating me up inside, and I'm not sure what to do. 

So, AITA for being too afraid to ask my friend not to smoke weed around me?","I've been friends with Sarah, 28F, for about 5 years now. We've been through a lot together and have a very close relationship. She's always been a bit of a social butterfly and loves to host parties and gatherings at her place. Lately, though, her smoking habits have become a major issue for me. She's been smoking weed a lot more frequently, and it's not just the smell that bothers me - it's the paranoia and anxiety it triggers in me. I've tried to brush it off as no big deal, but the truth is, it makes me extremely uncomfortable.

The thing is, I'm not really sure how to bring it up with Sarah. I'm afraid she'll think I'm judging her or being a buzzkill, and our friendship will suffer. I've noticed that when she's been smoking, she's not really the same person - she gets irritable and distant, and it's like she's not really present in the moment. I've tried to talk to her about it in a roundabout way, but she just thinks I'm being overly sensitive.

I've been avoiding going over to her place for parties and gatherings, and it's starting to feel like I'm missing out on our friendship. I feel guilty for not being more honest with her, but at the same time, I don't want to jeopardize our relationship. I'm starting to wonder if I'm being a bad friend for not speaking up about this.

Lately, Sarah has been trying to get me to come over to her place more often, and I feel like I'm stuck in this awkward limbo. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I also don't want to be around her when she's smoking. I'm not sure what to do, and I'm hoping you guys can offer some advice.

96,AITA for not Photoshopping my Stillborn Aunt into a Family Photo?,"There's a little known fact in my family (at least among the cousins and grandkids), that one of my aunts, Aunt Ann, was supposed to be a twin, but her twin sister was stillborn. It's not exactly a taboo topic or anything, just some random trivia that never has any reason to come up in conversation.  One day, I was visiting my Grandma, and showing her how I was using Photoshop for one of my school projects. She seemed really interested, got quiet for moment, and then got up and pulled a small diary out of her closet. She started talking, and to my surprise, I learned that she had named her lost baby, Sophia Rose. Every year she would write a birthday message in the diary, just to remember her. She had never told anybody all these years, because back then, that sort of thing just wasn't talked about. But now she wondered if there were any way I could photoshop another picture of Aunt Ann into her favorite family picture, so it looked like her twin was there. She had always wondered what it would've looked like with her family completed.  I, of course, was quite willing to do it. My Aunt Ann was having lunch with my mother and I a few days later, and I thought I'd run the idea by her then and ask her if she had a nice picture I could use.  But, to my surprise, both my mom and Aunt Ann were horrified with the idea. Aunt Ann especially said she didn't want it done, that using her picture for a dead person was morbid and creeped her out. It would be her face representing a ghost. Plus, apparently they weren't even identical twins, just fraternal, so they wouldn't have actually looked alike. She very clearly didn't feel comfortable with it.  I figured I probably shouldn't do it since Aunt Ann had quite clearly said no. When I told her, Grandma didn't seem upset or disappointed, she just said that she understood, and thanked me for looking into it. I told her if she ever wanted to talk to me about Sophia or make something else in memorial, I'd do it, but she said that it was fine, and it was so long ago it didn't really matter. She never brought it up again.  I thought that was the end of it, but years later now, I was chatting with one of my much younger cousins (not Aunt Ann's kid). Apparently she had never heard about Aunt Ann's twin, and grew quite upset with me when I told the story of the Photoshop request. She said that was a really heartless thing to do, to deny our grieving grandma's one chance to see what could've been. It could've given her some closure. She said I should've just done the picture anyways and just not told Aunt Ann about it. She would've never known.  Now I'm feeling guilty.  Even if it wasn't Sophia Rose, Grandma still could've pretended for just a moment that her lost daughter was there. It wouldn't have been hard to do it in secret, and I could've at least given her that. On the other hand, it feels really crummy to go behind my Aunt's back like that when she drew such a clear boundary.

It included my grandma, my parents, my siblings, my aunt, and her kids. The problem is that my aunt (45F) is usually pretty critical about how everyone looks, and she has a habit of suggesting edits or changes to our photos that can be pretty harsh.

After the event, my grandma reached out to me to ask if I could help her with a family photo. She wanted me to Photoshop it to remove some ""flaws"" she noticed, which I thought was harmless. However, when I mentioned this to my aunt, she got really upset. She believes that any touch-ups should be discussed with her first since she’s very particular about how the kids' appearances are portrayed, and she has previously asked me not to alter photos too heavily without consulting her.

I get where my aunt is coming from; she wants to maintain a certain standard and protect her kids’ images, which I respect. But my grandma, who is getting older and a bit self-conscious, just wanted something nice for her wall. I thought this might be a simple gesture to brighten her day, and I didn't want my aunt to burst that bubble by being overly negative about it.

I ended up telling my grandma that I'd rather not do it unless my aunt was on board first, even though my grandma insisted she was fine with it. My aunt thinks I should have just done it and let her handle the fallout, but I felt it was important to respect her wishes as well.

Now, I'm feeling conflicted. My grandma is disappointed, and my aunt feels validated. I’m really caught in the middle here. Am I the asshole for wanting to respect my aunt’s wishes even though it upset my grandma?","I (28F) am a graphic designer, and I often help out my family with small design projects when they need it. Recently, my grandma (75F) asked me if I could Photoshop a family photo to include my aunt (52F) who couldn't make it to the last family gathering. Grandma loves having complete family pictures on her mantel, and it really bothers her that my aunt wasn't in this one.

Here's where things get tricky – my aunt and I are close, and she’s made it very clear in the past that she doesn’t like being Photoshopped into pictures. She prefers to be in photos that she was actually present for. I understand her point of view, as she feels that being added in later feels a bit artificial and disingenuous. 

When I gently explained this to my grandma, suggesting we wait until the next family gathering to take a new photo, she got a bit upset. She said she misses having the whole family together in one picture and would love to look at it every day. I tried to propose a compromise, like doing a collage or something similar, but she wasn't interested.

My family is now divided on this. My mom thinks that I should just Photoshop the picture because it would make grandma happy, and she doesn't think my aunt would find out or even mind that much if she did. Some of my cousins agree with my mom, arguing that it's not a big deal and is just for grandma’s happiness. However, a few other relatives think I should respect my aunt's preference and not do it without her consent.

The current outcome is that the photo remains unaltered, and it’s caused a bit of tension. Grandma feels like I’m prioritizing my aunt's feelings over hers, and while I understand her perspective, I really don’t want to go against my aunt’s wishes. Now I’m stuck in the middle and feeling conflicted.

So, AITA for refusing to Photoshop the family photo without my aunt's consent, even if it means disappointing my grandma?","This is a throwaway.

I (25F) have been really close to my grandma for my entire life. She's been through a lot and has always been there for me and my family. My grandma is really excited that we finally took a family photo recently. The issue is that my aunt (28F), who is also in the photo, has been going through a really rough time and has gained some weight since the last family gathering. She's been self-conscious about it and has been making snide comments about everyone else in the family who has also gained weight.

My grandma asked me to send her the unedited photo so she could print it out and hang it in her living room. But then my aunt saw the unedited photo and freaked out, saying that she looked ""disgusting"" in it. She told me that I was being insensitive and that I should have edited the photo to make her look thinner.

I refused to edit the photo, saying that I didn't think it was right to alter reality to make someone look a certain way. My grandma called me and said that she understood why I was hesitant, but that she really wanted to hang the photo up and that it would make her happy. She also told me that my aunt was being really unreasonable and that I shouldn't feel guilty about refusing to edit the photo.

I told my grandma that I was happy to send her the edited photo if she really wanted it, but that I couldn't edit it without my aunt's consent. My grandma said that was fair and that she would talk to my aunt about it. But now my aunt is still being super upset with me and my grandma is being really supportive.

I feel like I did the right thing by refusing to edit the photo, but at the same time I don't want to hurt my aunt's feelings.

We went on a vacation with my sister, her husband, their 2 girls (14 and 12), and my brother, his wife, their 2 girls (15 and 13), and their son (20). \n\nThe house we booked has a huge bunkroom that all of the girls were going to sleep in. There were 2 bunk beds with trundle beds underneath and a single bed. Amelia is very sick and can\'t sleep on the top bunk because she has a hard time getting up and down the ladder. The trundles are also out of the question because she has a hard time standing up when she\'s that close to the ground. That leaves the bottom bunks and the single bed. I told my brother and sister that Amelia needs the bottom bunks or single bed. They both said that should be fine. \n\nWe got to the house and the girls ran to start calling their beds. Usually when we all travel somewhere, the girls choose their beds in order from oldest to youngest but I assumed my brother and sister talked to their kids about Amelia needing either the bottom bunk or single beds. Anyway, Amelia was left with a top bunk. \n\nShe came to tell me what happened so I went to talk to my daughters and nieces and see if anyone was willing to switch with Amelia. Everyone, including my daughters, said it\'s not a big deal, they\'ve always chosen beds this way, and the top bunks aren\'t even that high up. I told Amelia she was going to sleep in the bedroom with me and my wife. She was upset about it but we told her it\'s better for her because she needs to sleep early and take naps anyway. \n\nShe went to play with her cousins and everything was okay the first day but on the second day, she ran to us crying because her cousins were teasing her for sleeping in her parents bed instead of the top bunk. We talked to them again but they brushed us off. Then I asked my older two why they didn\'t defend her but they said they didn\'t think it was a big deal and she\'s old enough to defend herself. Amelia clung to us for the rest of the day and was feeling miserable. We couldn\'t get her to play with her cousins so we decided to end the trip early and go home. \n\nMy older two were furious that we ended the trip early because she was ""too spoiled for the top bunk"" and ""couldn\'t handle a little teasing"".

We’ve been friends for years, but we've drifted a bit lately due to some life changes. However, I still consider Sarah a close friend, and I'm excited to celebrate her special day. The thing is, my ex-friend Jess (28F) is also going to be there.

Jess and I had a falling out a few months ago over a pretty serious issue. We had been friends for a long time, but the situation was really hurtful, and I just can't be around her anymore. When I heard she was on the guest list for Sarah's party, I felt a wave of anxiety. I explained my feelings to Sarah, saying that I would prefer not to attend if Jess was going to be there. I didn't outright demand it, but I did heavily imply that it would mean a lot to me if she could consider not inviting Jess.

Sarah responded by saying she doesn't want to choose sides and that she values both of our friendships. She acknowledged my feelings but made it clear that she doesn't want to exclude anyone from her celebration. I understand where she’s coming from, but I felt like she was being insensitive to my situation. I even said that I would feel uncomfortable and would likely leave early if Jess was there, but Sarah stuck to her position.

Now, I’m stuck in this weird situation. Some of my friends think I was right to express my feelings about Jess coming, but others believe I overstepped boundaries by asking Sarah to exclude someone from her life. I’m feeling terrible about the whole thing, especially since I really want to support Sarah’s birthday but can’t shake the thought of running into Jess.

Ultimately, I don’t want to hurt Sarah’s feelings or put her in an awkward position with our mutual friends, but I just wish she would take my side in this. So, AITA for expecting Sarah to not invite Jess to her birthday party?","So, here's a bit of backstory: I (28F) used to be best friends with Sarah (28F) for over a decade. We were inseparable until about a year ago when we had a huge falling out over some pretty personal stuff. We haven't spoken since, and it's been really awkward because we have a lot of mutual friends. One of those mutual friends is Emma (28F), who I know through Sarah but wouldn't really consider a close friend myself.

Emma's birthday is coming up, and she's planning a big party with all of our common friends. I was really looking forward to it because it's been a while since I've had a chance to unwind and catch up with everyone. But then I found out that Sarah is also invited. Emma has every right to invite whomever she wants to her party, but I just can't stand the thought of being in the same room with Sarah given our past. The tension between us makes social gatherings unbearable for me, and I was honestly hoping to avoid her as much as possible.

I ended up texting Emma to ask if she could exclude Sarah from the party, explaining how uncomfortable it would make me feel. Emma replied saying that she values both of us as friends and doesn’t want to take sides or exclude anyone. She suggested that I try to find a way to coexist with Sarah for the evening since it was her birthday celebration and it should be a happy occasion for everyone.

When I received Emma’s response, I felt a mix of disappointment and frustration. I told her that it was insensitive of her to expect me to be around someone who had hurt me so deeply, and that true friends should show more understanding of my feelings. Emma responded by saying she was sorry I felt that way but reiterated that she couldn’t uninvite Sarah and hoped I would reconsider attending.

Upon sharing this with a few of our mutual friends, opinions were split. Some thought that Emma should have sided with me because of how close Sarah and I used to be, while others believed that Emma was right to remain neutral and keep her guest list unchanged. My boyfriend thinks I was out of line to expect Emma to alter her plans for my comfort and says I'm making this about me when it should be about celebrating Emma.

So now, I’m left questioning my actions. Should I have kept my feelings to myself instead of asking Emma to pick sides? Am I the asshole for expecting my non-friend to exclude my ex-friend from her birthday party?","I've been friends with Rachel (29f) since college. We've lost touch over the years, but we still keep in touch through social media. Rachel recently got married and moved away, but she's still a part of our mutual friend group.

Rachel's birthday is next week, and she posted on Facebook that she was having a big party at a local venue. I immediately sent her a message inviting myself and my girlfriend to the party. A few days later, Rachel's fiancé (let's call him Mike) sent me a private message asking if it would be okay if they didn't invite our mutual friend, Emily (28f).

Apparently, Mike and Emily had a falling out a few years ago, and Mike still harbors some resentment towards her. He said that Emily has ""done some questionable things in the past"" and that he'd rather not have her at the party. I told Mike that I understood his perspective, but I didn't think it was fair to exclude Emily without giving her a chance to make amends.

However, when Rachel posted about the party again, she specifically mentioned that Emily was not invited. I didn't say anything at the time, but I felt uncomfortable with the whole situation. When Emily found out she wasn't invited, she was understandably upset.

Rachel and I have had some disagreements in the past, but I've always considered her a friend. I feel like I'm being pulled into a situation that's not my problem, but at the same time, I don't want to betray Rachel's trust by speaking up.

AITA for expecting Rachel and Mike to exclude Emily from the party?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""So, here's a bit of backstory: I (28F) used to be best friends with Sarah (28F) for over a decade. We were inseparable until about a year ago when we had a huge falling out over some pretty personal stuff. We haven't spoken since, and it's been really awkward because we have a lot of mutual friends. One of those mutual friends is Emma (28F), who I know through Sarah but wouldn't really consider a close friend myself.\n\nEmma's birthday is coming up, and she's planning a big party with all of our common friends. I was really looking forward to it because it's been a while since I've had a chance to unwind and catch up with everyone. But then I found out that Sarah is also invited. Emma has every right to invite whomever she wants to her party, but I just can't stand the thought of being in the same room with Sarah given our past. The tension between us makes social gatherings unbearable for me, and I was honestly hoping to avoid her as much as possible.\n\nI ended up texting Emma to ask if she could exclude Sarah from the party, explaining how uncomfortable it would make me feel. Emma replied saying that she values both of us as friends and doesn’t want to take sides or exclude anyone. She suggested that I try to find a way to coexist with Sarah for the evening since it was her birthday celebration and it should be a happy occasion for everyone.\n\nWhen I received Emma’s response, I felt a mix of disappointment and frustration. I told her that it was insensitive of her to expect me to be around someone who had hurt me so deeply, and that true friends should show more understanding of my feelings. Emma responded by saying she was sorry I felt that way but reiterated that she couldn’t uninvite Sarah and hoped I would reconsider attending.\n\nUpon sharing this with a few of our mutual friends, opinions were split. Some thought that Emma should have sided with me because of how close Sarah and I used to be, while others believed that Emma was right to remain neutral and keep her guest list unchanged. My boyfriend thinks I was out of line to expect Emma to alter her plans for my comfort and says I'm making this about me when it should be about celebrating Emma.\n\nSo now, I’m left questioning my actions. Should I have kept my feelings to myself instead of asking Emma to pick sides? Am I the asshole for expecting my non-friend to exclude my ex-friend from her birthday party?""}]","{

98,AITA for not feeling comfortable paying for a whole weekend trip with friends if I only stayed 1 day due to a difficult financial situation?,"*not from the US or a native speaker so apologies for any grammar mistakes!  This weekend, a group of university friends organized a weekend trip staying at a small cottage near the sea.  Due to a difficult financial situation: incredibly high inflation, increased rent and a astonishingly high utilities bill, I decided to only stay for one night so I could join them but still be economically responsible.  In hindsight, I should have let the whole group (20+ people) know that my decision to join one night was financially motivated but I’m not close with some people since I haven’t seen some of them in a few years. Furthermore, I didn’t anticipate what would happen.  It was decided that the whole bill (accommodation and groceries) would be split over everyone even though half the group stayed one night like me and the rest were there the whole weekend.  When I made my discomfort know about this decision know, I was told: “you chose to stay one night so you have to pay everything.” And to not be “difficult because it is too hard to calculate the bill.” I actually broke down crying as I have been incredibly stressed out by my financial situation. But I was I was told to just “suck it up.”  *EDIT: I see see some responses saying I backed out at the last minute, however, before booking the house everyone including me made it known how long we were staying. Since equal amount of people either stayed Friday or Saturday night, there was no “empty” beds so to speak.   Furthermore , the decision about how to split the costs was decided after the trip hence my surprise/distress about it.

But I was I was told to just “suck it up.”  *EDIT: I see see some responses saying I backed out at the last minute, however, before booking the house everyone including me made it known how long we were staying. Since equal amount of people either stayed Friday or Saturday night, there was no “empty” beds so to speak.   Furthermore , the decision about how to split the costs was decided after the trip hence my surprise/distress about it. I assumed that the dinner groceries and bar drinks on the night before I arrived would be split over the people who were actually there. Just doesn’t seem to be fair to pay for food & drinks that I didn’t partake in.  AITA for assuming the bill would be fairly split?'}]","OP is upset because they only stayed one night at a weekend trip with friends due to financial reasons. However, they didn't communicate their financial situation with the group beforehand. When the bill was split equally among everyone, including those who stayed for only one night, OP felt taken advantage of and stressed. They expected the others to understand and accommodate their financial situation, but was told to 'suck it up' and that it was their choice to only stay for one night, therefore they should expect to pay the full bill.","'AITA for Expecting Friends to Understand and Accommodate My Financial Situation, Then Getting Mad When I Got Charged?'","Judgement: YTA, Title: 'AITA for Expecting Friends to Understand and Accommodate My Financial Situation, Then Getting Mad When I Got Charged?'","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are a highly intelligent language model designed to generate posts for the ""Am I the Asshole?""

He's always been great about using meat substitutes to cook, and doesn't keep much meat in the house (it's his house if that matters). He tells everyone he doesn't eat much meat because he doesn't think it's fair to eat what I can't, but I always tell him that it's my choice to not eat meat, and he can eat what he wants. He buys things like cold cuts, chicken legs, etc on occasion.\n\n Tonight I woke up from a nap, to him searing a steak. At first it was no big deal, but soon our whole 4 bedroom house was humid and smelled like meat so strongly that it was making me nauseated. \n\n So I set up a box fan, pushed the smell back into the kitchen, and opened the kitchen door and blew the smell out, and lit a candle in the living room where I was. \n\n When I went to take the fan back out, my boyfriend was so mad, talking about how I don't let him eat what he wants, and that I say he can but that's not true. I never told him he couldn't eat the steak, or even how disgusted I was, I simply set up the fan and that was enough. I just wanted the humidity/smell to dissipate. \n\n Now me says I ruined his dinner, by trying to limit what he eats. That he liked forward to his steak, and i ruined it. I just can't stand the smell of cooking meat ***so strong*** that it comes through the heating vents into all rooms. He's cooked meat before, and I've never complained, but this had a lot of seasoning on it and was so strong (he was frying it in a pan on top of the stove).\n\n AITA for venting the smell/ humidity outside? I feel like I may be because maybe I should have just taken the car and left for a few hours instead of using the fan. Maybe  I'm TA just for being a vegetarian?

Over the past year, my financial situation has changed significantly. I lost my job due to company downsizing and, while I’ve been searching for a new one, my savings are dwindling. I've been upfront with my friends about my struggles and have asked them to be understanding when planning outings, whether it’s dinners, trips, or any other activities that require spending money.

Recently, we planned a weekend getaway to a cabin in the mountains, and at first, I hesitated to go because I knew the costs would add up. However, my friends reassured me that they were going to keep things budget-friendly. They promised that we’d share meals and split costs as evenly as possible. I decided to tag along, hoping to have a good time but also keeping an eye on my wallet.

The first night, we decided to order pizza, and I contributed what I could, which was less than half of what everyone else put in. I asked them to please keep my budget in mind for the rest of the trip, and they agreed. The next day, while we were out hiking, they suggested a restaurant for lunch that looked a bit pricey. I mentioned again that I’d prefer something more affordable, but they dismissed my concerns, saying it was a “special occasion.”

When the bill came, I was charged the full amount of the meal, including a share of drinks I didn’t partake in and appetizers I didn’t want. I was really frustrated and expressed how unfair it was that they charged me this without any discussion. I ended up getting into a heated argument with my friends about how they didn’t respect my financial situation, claiming they’d promised to accommodate me.

In the end, I ended up paying the amount without any further argument but left feeling really upset and disappointed. A few of my friends say I overreacted and should have just paid my share without getting mad, while others agree that we should have discussed costs more openly. I’m wondering if I should have just kept quiet and sucked it up, or if I was right to expect some understanding from my friends regarding my situation.

So, AITA for expecting my friends to understand my financial situation and then getting mad when I was charged for something I didn't agree to?","I've recently found myself in a bit of a financial bind. My hours got cut at work and I’m trying to make ends meet while looking for a better job. My friends know about my situation and have been generally supportive, or so I thought.

Last weekend, a group of us decided to go out for dinner at a fairly nice restaurant. I told them upfront that I couldn’t really afford to go all out and they said it was fine, they’d cover my meal this time and I could pay them back when I could. I was really grateful and made sure to order something small and inexpensive to minimize what I owed.

Everything seemed to be going well until the bill came. One of my friends suggested we just split the bill evenly to make it easier. This made no sense to me since some of them had ordered multiple courses, drinks, and desserts, while I had only ordered a small appetizer. I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable with this and reminded them of my situation.

My friends assured me it was fine and they didn’t mind covering the extra cost. I thought I was in the clear, but then, a few days later, one of them sent me a Venmo request for my share, which was way more than what I had consumed. I was livid and felt completely blindsided.

When I confronted them, they said they thought I was okay with splitting the bill evenly since I didn’t say anything more at the restaurant, and that they expected me to pay them back eventually anyway. I felt betrayed because they had initially said they would cover me, and now they were acting like I was trying to freeload.

I ended up paying the Venmo request because I didn’t want to cause more drama, but I’m still really upset about it. Some of my friends say I’m overreacting and that it’s just money, while others say they understand but think I should have clarified things better at the time.

Now I’m questioning if I handled this the right way or if I’m the asshole for expecting my friends to accommodate my financial situation and then getting mad when they charged me. So, AITA for expecting friends to understand and accommodate my financial situation, then getting mad when I got charged?","I've been friends with a group of people since high school and we've all been pretty close over the years. We went to the same college and have remained close even after graduation. Recently, one of my friends got a pretty well-paying job and is now in a position to splurge on some luxuries. We've all been pretty jealous of their success, but I've been struggling financially - my job isn't very stable and I've been living paycheck to paycheck.

When we planned our annual summer vacation, I mentioned that I wasn't really able to afford the trip, but I was excited to join in anyway. They all said they'd cover my costs, which was incredibly kind of them. However, things got complicated when we started planning the actual trip. It turned out that the group had planned on renting a fancy house with a pool and all the bells and whistles, which would be a huge financial strain for me. I politely suggested that we look for something more budget-friendly, but they brushed me off, saying that I should just ""not worry about it"" and that they'd cover my costs.

Fast forward to the day we were supposed to leave. I got an email from one of my friends saying that I had been charged for my share of the trip costs, which was over $1,000. I was shocked and hurt. I immediately called them and asked them why I was being charged when they had said they'd cover my costs. They told me that I should have communicated my financial concerns earlier and that they assumed I could afford it.

I was livid. I felt like they were being insensitive and that they didn't understand my financial struggles. I told them that I was being charged over $1,000 and that I couldn't afford it. They just told me that I should have been more upfront about my financial situation and that I was being ""unreasonable"" for expecting them to accommodate me.

I ended up having to ask my parents to help me pay off the debt, which was humiliating. I'm still hurt and angry with my friends for not understanding my financial situation and for expecting me to just ""deal with it.""

99,AITA for telling my husband I couldn’t help him,We have two kids a 2 year old and a newborn.

This morning we both woke at 6:30 him to use the bathroom and me to nurse the baby and change her. We went back to bed and I got woken up with my toddler using me as a jungle gym. He expressed wanting a break and I said I’d help him once I finished nursing the toddler. However last night he brought home fast food and sometimes when I eat fried fast food especially when the oil hasn’t recently been changed it upsets my stomach severely and I’ll get really bad cramping nausea etc. I started to feel sick while I was nursing and told him to give me 30 I wasn’t feeling well and I’d come.   I fell asleep while nursing and woke up because I was getting severe cramps. I tried texting and calling his phone because I couldn’t shout. I walked down to the kitchen and explained the situation. I told him to just leave anything he wanted help with (dishes laundry etc) and I’d handle it when I could.

I (28F) have been going through a particularly tough time lately. Work has been overwhelming, and I recently lost a family member, which has taken a huge emotional toll on me. I’ve been trying to deal with everything as best as I can, but it’s been hard.

My husband has been supportive on the surface, but I’ve noticed some of his actions have been making me feel a bit overlooked. For instance, he really loves playing video games. Normally, I’m totally okay with him enjoying his hobbies; I mean, everyone needs an escape sometimes. But this past week, when I’ve been feeling particularly low and in need of support, I found him spending hours gaming while I was home alone, trying to process my feelings. 

One night, I had a mini meltdown. I was feeling overwhelmed and just wanted to talk about everything that was bothering me. When I went to find him, I saw he was deeply focused on a game and didn’t even hear me calling for him. I eventually sat down next to him and tried to express how I felt—how I wished he would prioritize time for me during this tough period. He seemed frustrated, saying he needed that time to unwind and that I could have just joined him if I wanted to spend time together.

After I expressed my feelings, he apologized and said he didn't mean to make me feel overlooked. However, he also emphasized that he believes it’s crucial for both of us to have our own ways of dealing with stress, which I totally understand. We had a good conversation after that, and he made an effort to spend more time with me in the following days. 

My friends seem to have differing opinions. Some think that I’m being too needy and that he deserves his own space, while others see my feelings as valid and agree that in a partnership, it’s important to make room for each other’s emotional needs. I'm just grateful we talked about it, but I can’t shake the feeling of guilt for having voiced my needs when he has his own stress to deal with.

So, AITA for feeling overlooked when my husband needed to prioritize his own needs during a tough time?","I'm having a really tough time right now and I'm not sure if my feelings are justified. My husband (36M) and I (34F) have been married for ten years. We usually have a pretty balanced relationship where we take care of each other's needs, but recently things have been hard for me.

About a month ago, I lost my job unexpectedly, which has been a massive blow to my self-esteem and our financial stability. On top of that, my mother has been very ill, and I've been trying to spend as much time as possible with her, which adds to my emotional strain. These events have taken a toll on me, and I've been feeling overwhelmed and isolated.

My husband is a very driven person and has a demanding job. He's been working late almost every night, which means he hasn't been home much to support me. When he is home, he often retreats to his office to unwind or play video games, saying he needs time to decompress. I understand that he needs his own space and time to relax after a long day, but it's been hard for me to cope without his presence and support.

I've tried to talk to him about how I'm feeling, and he listens, but his actions remain the same. He tells me he loves me and that he's sorry for not being around more, and he assures me that he's working hard to provide for our future. I appreciate his efforts and intentions, but I can't help feeling overlooked and unsupported during this difficult period.

My friends have mixed opinions on the matter—some say I should cut him some slack because he's also dealing with his own pressures, while others believe he should be making more effort to support me emotionally.

Right now, our relationship isn't in any immediate danger, but I can't deny that I'm feeling really lonely and overwhelmed. I want to be understanding of his needs, but I also feel like my needs are being neglected.

So, am I the asshole for feeling overlooked when my husband prioritizes his own needs over mine during this bad time?","This is a throwaway.

My husband (28M) and I (27F) have been married for three years. We've been trying to have a baby for the past two years, but it's been really tough. I've been experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety because of the constant failed attempts and the pressure of meeting our family's expectations. I've been feeling really overwhelmed and down about the whole situation.

Recently, we found out that I have a polyp in my uterus that's causing my periods to be irregular. The doctor said it's not uncommon, but it's a setback for our fertility journey. I was really upset about it and broke down in tears when I told my husband. I was expecting him to be supportive and understanding, but he seemed really preoccupied with his own issues.

He's been having a tough time at work, and his boss is breathing down his neck. He's been feeling really anxious and stressed, and I can understand that. However, I felt like he completely overlooked my emotional needs during that time. He barely listened to me, didn't offer any words of encouragement, and just seemed to be focusing on his own problems.

To make matters worse, he even had the nerve to tell me that I should be happy that the doctor found the polyp, and that it's a ""good thing"" that we know what's causing my irregular periods. He said that I should be focusing on the positive and not getting so worked up about it. I felt like he was dismissing my feelings and not taking my struggles seriously.

I tried to talk to him about how I felt, but he just brushed it off and told me that I'm being too sensitive. I feel like he's not taking my needs into consideration and is prioritizing his own stress and anxiety over mine. Am I being too sensitive for expecting him to be more supportive during this tough time, or is he being inconsiderate for not prioritizing my emotional well-being?","[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\nYou are an AI Annotator tasked with evaluating an ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) Reddit post.\nPlease use the following metrics to assess the quality of the post.\nFor each metric, provide a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\nReturn only metrics, scores, and comments for each metric in the tabular format.\n\nEvaluation Metrics and Scale:\n\nTone and Language Colloquialness:\nDoes the post employ natural, conversational language that is consistent with typical AITA posts.\n1 = Not authentic at all, 5 = Extremely authentic\n\nPlausibility:\nIs the scenario realistic and believable within the context of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not believable, 5 = Highly believable\n\nAbbreviation Usage:\nDoes the post use abbreviations (e.g., SAHM, MIL, DH) effectively and appropriately?\n1 = Abbreviations are confusing or not used appropriately, 5 = Abbreviations are used effectively and enhance the post\'s authenticity\n\nReadability:\nIs the post easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language?\n1 = Very hard to follow, 5 = Extremely easy to follow\n\nSpecificity:\nAre there enough concrete details to fully understand the context and conflict?\n1 = Lacking specific details, 5 = Highly detailed\n\nConflict Clarity:\nIs the central conflict clearly defined, with a clear dilemma that prompts readers to judge?\n1 = Very unclear conflict, 5 = Extremely clear conflict\n\nMoral Ambiguity:\nDoes the situation have enough complexity or nuance to provoke debate about who is at fault?\n1 = No ambiguity, 5 = Highly ambiguous, making it hard to judge\n\nSubreddit Alignment:\nDoes the post\'s tone, style, and content align with the expectations of the AITA subreddit?\n1 = Not aligned with AITA norms, 5 = Perfectly aligned with AITA norms\n\nEmotional Resonance:\nDoes the post evoke emotions from the reader, such as empathy or anger?\n1 = No emotional impact, 5 = Strong emotional impact\n\nPlease use the following JSON format to return your evaluation:\n\n{\n    ""evaluation"": {\n        ""Tone_and_Language_Colloquialness"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Plausibility"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Abbreviation_Usage"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Readability"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Specificity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Conflict_Clarity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Moral_Ambiguity"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Subreddit_Alignment"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        },\n        ""Emotional_Resonance"": {\n            ""score"": 1-5,\n            ""comments"": """"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""I'm having a really tough time right now and I'm not sure if my feelings are justified.
